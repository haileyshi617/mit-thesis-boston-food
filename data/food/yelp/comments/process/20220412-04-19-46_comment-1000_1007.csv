0,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,5 star rating,5/14/2016,"I feel obligated to give Kipos 5 stars because there is no way on Earth (or any other planet for that matter) that it deserves an overall rating under 4 stars. 

After reading all the reviews for Kipos, I was very apprehensive to check it out. 1.5 stars, really? It can't be that bad. If it wasn't for my close proximity, I probably would've just skipped it, but I'm so glad I didn't. 

First off, when I walked in the door, the sweet older gentleman and his presumptive wife were in there, MAKING THE DOUGH FROM SCRATCH! THIS IS NOT A TYPO! This alone should warrant a couple stars! You don't find your local Dominos putting in this kind of effort. 

They have a pretty extensive menu, but being primarily a pizza joint, I decided to try a calzone. I got the chicken parm calzone and let's just say this thing was a monster. For 11 bucks, you get a monster calzone that barely fit in the box! 

Once I sprinted home to sink my mitts and fangs into this monstrosity I had to cut it in half because it was so darn big. This allowed me to get a cross sectional view of all the delicious insides of this beast. It was loaded down with cheese and sauce and chicken, and I mean loaded down. Everything tasted so hot and fresh, I feel like what I got was in a different universe from that I was expecting after reading the previous reviews. 

There's no doubt I'll be going back, and now not just out of sheer convenience but because Kipos is awesome! A local place like Kipos that has been around in Charlestown for a while is right in my wheelhouse for places I love. Support local!"
1,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,5 star rating,11/5/2020,"Pizza is not great honestly but the guy serving the pizza was the man! Tight knit neighborhood spot you can tell, wish I could've tried more food."
2,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,2 star rating,10/27/2018,Chicken fingers or tenders they are the  same thing and sorry to say they continue to disappoint. I liked the Fry's but it's been a while since I had them. I get a Coke or a frappe there once in a while. They seem to be nice people.
3,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,1 star rating,11/23/2019,"It's been a long time since I have ordered hear but I recently ordered from here and they was rude so I said to myself just let it go. I just tried to order from here again and once again very rude... "" so what the hell do you want "" I will never order from here again and hope they shut down... my second time trying to order and having someone talk to you like that is completely uncalled for. I was never rude just trying to find out if it was a small or large pizza we wanted and the guy who answered was very rude and so was the lady the last time I ordered. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
4,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,5 star rating,11/17/2018,Best chicken fingers in town! No doubt. I moved into the area and have been trying to find a local eating establishment and now I've found it. Thanks Kipos!
5,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,1 star rating,7/30/2015,"Not sure what kind of crime ring this shop is a front for, but it is clearly not related to food.

I had a hard time choking down the pizza that came out of a kitchen that was furnished by a hoarder in 1983."
6,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,2 star rating,2/18/2018,"Tasteless pizza ... Legit. Subs are ok , calzones are like meat encased in a heavy brick of dough, cold cuts are good , the fries are probably the best thing they have , chicken fingers are gamey and rubbery tasting.  The clientele is mostly young kids which probably explains its surprising longevity in the area."
7,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,1 star rating,7/28/2010,"Stop. Just stop right there. Who are you people? They USED to have bad pizza? 3 stars? 4 stars?!! Stop it!

Look, this isn't about pizza snobbery. I've had good pizza, and I've had mediocre pizza. But I love pizza in nearly every form. Those little frozen pizza bagels are fantastic to me! Even the greasiest late night bar crawl pizza is still tasty because it's pizza! People groan about Hi-Fi in Central Square, Cambridge. Sure it's not GREAT pizza... but it's still pizza and it's still tasty. Soggy, crispy, deep dish, thin crust, burnt, greasy, rubbery... I've endured it all and I've gone back for seconds. I love pizza. Who doesn't?

Kipos should not exist. This was, by far, the worst pizza I've ever had in my entire life... fresh... frozen... or otherwise. I couldn't even understand it. My brain simply could not fathom how a business could sell this and call it brick oven pizza. How can a business sell this and maintain a customer base? How are they making their money? Somebody has to explain this to me!

First of all, the establishment is a wreck. Ceiling fans hanging by wires, chairs and boxes piled up in the back like they're on their way to the dump, but they're not... they're covered in dust. It's as though this is some sort of sorrowful tribute to a bygone era. There's even an arcade machine sitting unplugged and covered in dust.

I ordered a large cheese pizza. The most simple of pies. They reached under the counter... shuffled a bit... and out came a pie, in mere seconds. It looked frozen, perhaps... I honestly can't say. But it was not made from anything fresh. My thoughts? Even frozen pizza is kind of ok... so I'll go with it.

I'm not the type of person to refuse to pay for an ordered meal... but man, in this case I wish I was. This pizza was awful. Thin little slices of  cardboard with crusty cheese on them. You could hold the slice vertically and nothing would move. You could throw it like a frisbee (I actually made the motion vigorously with a slice) and none of the ingredients moved. It wouldn't bend, flop, slide, or drip. This is NOT pizza. It reminded me of that scene in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation when the turkey explodes... and they're all sitting around eating these little nuclear bits of crispy flesh.

Seriously guys... maybe it's run by a family of good people. But don't support this mess. They're not even trying. These good people need to move on and run something easier like an ice cream stand. They do sell ice cream here. Maybe that's where their bread and butter lies."
8,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,1 star rating,7/28/2015,"This is a place you eat at if you are really hungry and there is nothing else around, I've had the steak and cheese, where's the cheese? My son had the pizza, didnt even want to finish it, they use the microwave for heating and cooking most of their food (no! ) they have to customer service skills to save their life. After i ordered for delivery once i said never again the lady knocked on my door and i told her more then once to hold on because i was in the bathroom and i know she could hear me (small house thin walls) she had someone bang on my window to get me to rush and come to the door"
9,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,5 star rating,2/3/2017,I walked by this place and I decided to try it out. I ordered fries and a eggplant Parmesan sub and it was really good! I was surprised. The place could use a little fixing up but over all good place.
0,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,4/3/2022,"I don't reside in Boston, so my reviews tend to be of the places I love.  Caffe Vittoria is such a place.  A visit to Caffe Vittoria is a bit like stepping back in time to the 1930's.  It is also assuredly an opportunity to enjoy the best cappuccino in the USA.   

Service is not always consistent, so don't be in a rush.  It's ok to take your time and savor things."
1,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,1/12/2022,"Best. Cappuccino. Ever. 

I visited Boston from the SF Bay Area and really enjoyed the ambiance + coffee here. The powder on top elevated the drink a lot - subtle chocolate flavor lightly sweetened with the frothiness of the milk. 

Super yummy and would be such a great spot for a date or a drink with friends!"
2,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,12/16/2021,"I visit the cafe whenever I walk through the north end and it was a cute place! There were no issues being seated, but do expect indoors to be loud and crowded on weekend evenings. If you'd like a quieter experience, I recommend visiting earlier in the day. That being said, The BEST tiramisu in town. The espresso martini's are good, as well as the cappuccino.

Some things about the cafe:
-Have cash on hand
-it seems to be open pretty late, which is a plus factor.
-I'm not sure if it's because the building is old but there's an almost smoke like smell engrained into the building and walls. It reeks, almost like cigars, but there's no smoking allowed indoors so I'm not sure where it comes from. It's the biggest factor of why I don't like being in there too long. I eat my tiramisu and martini and leave asap.
-Due to the nature of the building being old, it seems they haven't renovated their bathrooms. There's holes in the walls in the bathrooms, which is creepy to say the least. 

Overall, they can preserve the buildings history while still making upgrades that would help out the cafe tons I'm sure. Still, good food and drinks and worth a stop when in the north end."
3,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/21/2022,So cute. Old school vibe with lots of locals. Friendly service -- all the espresso perfect for after a hearty Italian meal. almond milk cappuccino was perfect and the tiramisu was gone in 60 seconds. Perfect balance and not too sweet. I hear they have the best espresso martini :)
4,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,4/4/2022,Wish they had more options for non-coffee drinking customers. They only take cash only so be prepared for that.
5,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,3/13/2022,"Stopped in for a drink and to get out of the rain. Fun Italian vibe. Drinks were good but pricey, then again it is Boston and the North End. Service was great. Did not eat anything but the pastries looked good.  One day of my companions said it is the best espresso martini anywhere - could be fun to find out for yourself!"
6,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,11/28/2021,"A pretty cool ass cafe. Cafe Vittoria is a place to sip on some coffee or something more strong if you prefer a liquor. It has a pretty small menu of classy pastries and expensive things. Everything isn't extremely expensive though but it's more costly than a typical bakery. They also have desserts like sorbet. 

It doesn't have that much of a menu. Mostly it seems to be desserts and few things in the way of entrees and such. This is pretty much where to come after you've already eaten out and lie about being too full for dessert there. Coffee is a beverage of choice. There's also plenty of the classy hard stuff. I'm a Ladies Man so I get my Courvoisier. Please tell me you got the SNL reference there. It's $10 for a pour. They also have a Lemon Sorbet. It's $7 for a cup. This is fluffier than most sorbets. It has a light tartness that's not overwhelming or bitter. The only bad thing is it melts pretty fast so eat fast. 

A good place for classy desserts. It also has coffee and cognacs to sip on. The sorbet is the best palette cleanser so get it to finish up."
7,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,11/7/2021,"Stopped in for a cappuccino and walked out with a smile!

This CASH ONLY cafe knows how to do things right here. Their artistic creations brings happiness along with your drink.

This place is located on a very busy street so the crowd tends to shuffle in and spend some time enjoying the menu items."
8,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,12/5/2021,"Stopped by after dinner in the North End for some desserts and drinks on a Saturday night. This place was packed, but thankfully there are several floors so we were seated pretty quickly in the basement level.

Their menu is pretty expansive with a full bar and pretty much every coffee drink combination you could hope for. I got a mocha and flan for dessert. Upstairs vibe was loud, eclectic cafe x bar energy. Downstairs felt more like a pub with dark lighting, booths, woodsy interiors, and fewer people. Service was a bit slow, but to be expected due to the time.

Mocha was great and flan was rich and dense. Nice place to chat with friends and stay warm post dinner if you're not ready to head home yet. 

As a heads up, they were closing the basement level around 9:30pm on a Saturday and pretty much ushered us out (or we could have gone upstairs to wait for another table where it was really crowded). Something to keep in mind if you want to go chill here for a while. Also was cash only."
9,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,2/9/2022,"I absolutely love this cafe! This is a cash only place, and like most of North End establishments, it is pretty small so it can be a tight squeeze seating-wise. The inside is so cute, it's like being in an antique shop (in the best way!). Not to mention, their sweets are soo good. The tiramisu was perfection - not too sweet and had the right consistency. The limoncello mascarpone was on the sweeter side and also incredibly delicious."
10,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/15/2022,"BEST TIRAMISU EVER!! Come here after dinner for an amazing dessert. Its so light and fluffy, we had to order a second one it was so good."
11,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,11/12/2021,"Splendid.

Even though I do not drink coffee, I can tell their drinks are rich in flavor. They are also whimsical in appearance, fair in price, and vintage in name.

Whether you are going for an early morning pick me up, or that late night hopper, this is unparalleled value. Hard working ladies will ensure that you enjoy your hot beverage against the backdrop of 1940's and 1950's crooners swooning you with old favorites. It was a really special and unique experience that you can have too if you bring cash (sorry, no credit cards here folks). 

The best part was seeing customers recycle in and out. It seems people always want to be a part of something special here.

No wonder, because this cafe is something special."
12,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,4/6/2022,Best coffee in the North End.  They are cash only so just be aware of that when you go.
13,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,1/21/2022,"We stopped in to get out of the cold and grab some caffeine after an afternoon of shopping. Our small group had cappuccinos and sfogliatella. Service was a bit slow, but we understand it was very busy. Be aware that it is cash-only, tables are very close to each other, and the staff wear their masks under their chins (and do not respect personal boundaries, even after we asked nicely that they keep a little bit of distance). There is no excuse for being rude to customers and I'm sure there are other cafes with good cappuccinos in the area. (visited 11/7/15 and 12/31/21)"
14,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,9/6/2021,"By far my favorite cafe in North End! SUCH a cute shop with gorgeous interior design-- I love how they have old coffee machines/grinders and rustic framed posters. If you catch a spot by the window, you can get some natural sunlight and people watch. I came here 3 times during my one week Boston trip! 

Over three visit, I've tried their famous cappuccino, cannoli, tiramisu, iced latte, and americano. My favorite drink is the cappuccino and favorite dessert is the tiramisu by far. No complaints about the cappuccino-- the portion size was also quite large! Although the cannoli was very delicious already (especially dipped in the cappuccino!), their tiramisu is the best I've ever had. The flavor was so rich and I could really taste strong espresso in the soaked layers of cake. 

A perfect place to chill with a book, journal, or catch up with a friend, highly recommend!"
15,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/29/2021,"OMG! This has become my favorite haunt in North End. 

My friends and I all agreed that this place boasts the best tiramisu we've ever had. The first time we came, we split one slice and collectively finished it in about 30 seconds lol. My friend said he really liked the cannolis here too.

My favorite part of this shop is how their menu complements each other. I'd recommend pairing their pastries with a coffee drink with no sugar added, as the natural bitterness of espresso acts as a great palate cleanser in between bites of their sweet, creamy pastries. 

I was also a big fan of the venue, with seats next to their street-side windows. The natural sunlight here in the morning is great. 

Just be warned that this cafe, like most places in North End, is cash only, so come prepared! You definitely don't want to miss out."
16,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,12/18/2021,"Super cute place (very in the Christmas spirit when we went), very busy on a Saturday night, and they are CASH ONLY (but very fairly priced). We only tried the gelato which was delicious. I would love to go back and try their coffees and pastries as they also looked really good."
17,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,9/24/2021,"100% recommend!!! This was a highlight of our trip. To sit at a small Italian cafe (in the heart of little Italy) and be surrounded by individuals speaking the language helped us realize we were in for a treat. 

We ordered cappuccinos along with a slice of tiramisu. WOWOW... my mouth is watering thinking about it."
18,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,7/19/2021,"A quaint little spot to grab an Italian coffee and pastry. I especially loved seeing all of the espresso machines that the caffe has collected to display.

This caffe really reminded me of being back in Italy. You could walk into a bar, grab a quick coffee, say hello to friends, and then run off to continue your day. At Caffe Vittoria, much of the same was happening. Locals were stopping in to say hello and get their morning coffee. 

We stopped in hoping to enjoy breakfast pastries and a coffee. We have young children, and this isn't an ideal place to stop if you're worried about getting them something to eat also. The pastries are all rather dessert-like, except of course the biscotti. 

We ordered a cappuccino, americano, and a Napelatano. The pastry was yummy and very rich. The coffees were perfect. It's definitely a great place to stop for a coffee break and to have a seat and watch some of the world go by."
19,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/3/2021,"Located next to Mike's pastry. FYI do not eat your pastries from Mike's  if you order drinks etc. Not allowed. 

Nice service and we enjoyed our coffees."
20,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/21/2022,"I only wanted coffee! My daughter ordered the pastry for herself and it was so huge. As a mom, I had to help her. We're both so grateful. Wowza!"
21,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,7/6/2021,"This was a stop on a food tour and was the ""star of the show"" - cannoli in the opinion of the host was best in all of North End and after having one I could not disagree.  These are not mass produced like some of well known offerings on Hanover.  Not to say they aren't worthy of a stop but each city has those stops that are ""iconic"" but to locals you will find that better offerings are there for the taking (think cheesesteak in Philly, BBQ in Texas, Meixcan food in SoCal - there are well known spots and then the spots that the locals go to have that offering.  

Caffe Vittoria is that place for cannoli - the roll is crispy and not soggy due to pre-filled cheese.  The ricotta cheese is piped in AFTER shell is baked as it should be.  Best bite I had in Boston over the July 4th weekend.  Best sip you ask?  Oh why it was the cappucino here as well.  It was perfect temperature, silky and luscious with each sip.  I will definitely go back here next time around because of this cannoi and cappucino - it was that memorable - an easy 5 stars - don't even have to think about it - the mind doesn't come into it at all - just the taste."
22,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,7/17/2021,"My favorite place I visited while in Boston. This quaint, authentic cafe left nothing to be desired. We needed an afternoon pick me up, the cafe Vittoria delivered. We got iced lattes and a scoop of ice cream.

My favorite ice cream is Spumoni and only the authentic Italian places have the good stuff. I was delighted when I found out they offered it. It was so delicious and they drizzled a cherry sauce on top. The iced latte was just what we needed to continue our day - delicious, creamy and topped with coffee beans and chocolate shavings. 

Do yourself a favor and stop in here and enjoy one of the best places I've been to in a long time."
23,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/11/2022,"I will just say one word: TIRAMISU 
Now go, and enjoy. You are  welcome  Thank me later"
24,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,11/29/2021,"As much delicious food as there is to be had in the North End, coffee is a must for me.  Lavazza cappuccino with a delicious creama hit the spot!!  It was in the 30s and we'd been walking around for a little while.  This was my second visit - the place seems to be packed all the time.  It's crowded and loud.  I love every bit of it.  Our waitress was friendly, despite being very busy."
25,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,1/23/2022,"FYI: Cash Only! There is a sign outside, but somehow we missed it when walking in. We just stopped in for a Cafe Macchiato and Hot Chocolate and it was really delicious!"
26,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,11/8/2021,"Wonderful cafe in the North End. Solid gelato and coffee choices, as well as some alcoholic beverages. We tried the Caffe Mocha and it was wonderful. Service can be a little slow, but definitely worth the stop for an afternoon pick me up as a place to stop and rest before heading out again."
27,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,4/11/2021,"My friend and I came on a weekend morning for a sweet treat. The main room was full when we arrived, so we were seated in this back room with a perfect view of the trash barrels outside . I was surprised that the menu didn't have any prices, which made ordering pretty annoying.

We ordered an eclair and tiramisu to share. The eclair was nothing to write home about. It was cold, and the shell was kind of rubbery. The tiramisu, however, was absolutely delicious! It was actually the best tiramisu I've ever had! There wasn't an overwhelming amount of powder on top, and it was the perfect sweetness and texture! 

The service wasn't great though. The waitress barely came by. We wanted to order a second tiramisu, but literally an hour passed since she last checked on us. We literally had to ask for a check while she was finishing taking another table's order - or else who knows when she would come next. She also gave us the wrong receipt.

Overall, we loved the tiramisu and would've gladly gotten a second one. The poor service made the overall experience an okay-ish one. I doubt we'll be back to dine in - I'll try to grab a tiramisu for take out next time."
28,Caffé Vittoria,2 star rating,10/17/2021,"This was a definite miss for me. We had mediocre service, it was cash only, and my hazelnut latte was flavorless. 

It doesn't have a cute vibe or anything to make up for the downsides, so I'd look for another place for coffee instead."
29,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,10/9/2021,"Arrived on Saturday evening and instantly regretted it because this place was packed. We tried to find a table inside (failed) and then walked out disappointed. I find it curious none of the staff indoors let customers know that there are more seats in the other side of the cafe, which has its own separate entrance, counter, AND bathroom (you could easily mistake it for a restaurant next door). People often enter the side closer to the big white rectangular sign, see the tightly packed marble tables, and walk back out but I can assure you that right next to that entrance is another entrance that will lead to an entirely different lounge with bigger tables. 

I'm giving one star this time because after we failed to find a table for 4 indoors, we took a patio table. Someone came by to take our order while I had left to view the gelato flavors, but afterwards, no one came to take our order again. We tried to request a wait staff from the inside know that our table as well as all the other patio tables were ready to order. When I spoke with the counter staff to see if they could communicate someone to come outside, they stated they would be out but still no one came. We must've waited 20 minutes until we discovered the other lounge and sat at a table indoors yet again. Still no one came, even after it was obvious we had just sat at the back lounge. I spoke to 3 separate staff members to take our order, but it was not until I really took ahold of one by the counter, explaing that we had been waiting a while, that they finally sent someone over to our back table to take our order.  I most definitely understand the struggle of being shortstaffed during peak times and especially during the pandemic, but come on.... there was no apology. There was no ""Thank you for your patience."" Not acceptable. The gelato also came out half melted (not pictured), which was such a contrast to the gelato I was served when I first visited (see photos). This second visit left such a sour taste in my mouth that I don't think I'll be recommending this place to my friends and other locals again."
30,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,4/4/2022,"Horrible service.  Servers have an attitude, walked past us more than once to stand and take out their phones.  No smiles, which if you expect a tip you've got to earn it. Disappointing as I had heard so many good things about the espresso martinis.  Beverage itself was good, but didn't get positive vibes from the wait staff"
31,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/17/2021,"The ancestors would be very glad dropped by to be frank. It's old school in a good way. Staff is friendly and with Covid I'm sure they are having a time. You can use the QR code for the menu.
I'll tell you this kids I could sit here all day and try all the sweets. I got here before noon cause no true Italian has cappuccino after noon time as it's a breakfast drink. It's beautifully made and hits the spot. The tiramisu was just right not too much of it a nice slice actually if I were you and you were with others order ones for each of you. Most places in the states done really know how to make it.. here it was smooth and creamy.

The inside is lovely it reminds me of this spot I use to go to in Rome. You see the huge copper looking espresso machine.

A FEW THINGS

1)DO NOT BRING STUFF FROM MIKES NEXT DOOR 

2) CASH ONLY

Parking are you for real...it's Lil Italy you can't park right here but it's a 10 walk from the North Station Commuter Train"
32,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/17/2021,"This is right next Mike's pastries. The entrance is a bit hidden so just look closely. 
They could improve on their advertising by having their name in a big easel board in front of their store. Also, they need to showcase their pastries better.  These are homemade pastries! To see what they offer, i had to go near the bathroom and take a look. They are inside a fridge and it is not well lit...sigh!! Much can be improved. 
The coffee, hot chocolate and lobster tail was delicious! So yes, i do recommend this place."
33,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,1/19/2022,Cute little spot in North End.  Easy ordering at the tables.  We got a couple of hot chocolates to escape the rain and really loved the decor and the drinks.  Will be back!
34,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/12/2021,Busy! Cappuccino macchiato and cannoli. We sat outside. Perfection ! Only thing that could use improvement? The way you get an outside seat. It's not clear if you wait or ask.
35,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,1/28/2021,"Hot chocolate was just what I needed today with all the snow flurries! My roommate and I love exploring new places in Boston and after coming to this cafe, we will definitely be returning. What's really cool is that it's Boston's first Italian cafe! The decor inside fits the vibe perfectly.

My roommate and I both tried the 'Sleigh Ride' which is hot chocolate with Godiva chocolate and Baileys. It was delicious! The one down side to this cafe is that it is cash only and we didn't know this before we left the apartment. I never carry cash on me, but luckily my roommate had just enough for the drinks. If we had known, we would have brought more cash and tried some of the pastries!"
36,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,9/24/2021,I came here at night for the espresso martini and a cannoli. The martini was super good and strong as well. The cannoli filling was sooo good. Service was very fast. Definitely a great place to go for drinks and dessert after dinner. Pro tip: it's cash only
37,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,1/13/2021,"Covid review:

I came here in August. 

Cash only !

I love the decor so much.  The coffee and cannolli are basic. Sorry ill say it. The cannoli cream is home made but I can get better down the block. The coffee was okay.  We had some grappa, which was so nice !  Good service too. Overall its a cute spot to sit down and relax for a minute, take in all the cute decor and history."
38,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,2/6/2021,"Went to Caffe Vittoria to try their famous limoncello cake slice and it was a hit! This beautiful Italian cafe takes you out of Boston and immediately transports you to Italy. Everything in the caffe makes you feel as if you are somewhere in Europe. The decor and old  coffee machine scattered around the cafe are entertaining to look at. This place is also HUGE I thought it was small, but if you walk to the end of the hall there is a loop that takes you to a different room with more tables and old decor. I would say this is an experience type of coffee place. 

The limoncello cake was a fluffy decadence. It was moist  and the mascarpone icing blends well with this moist cake. I loved the experience!"
39,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,6/15/2021,My companion and I were walking through the North End section of Boston and decided on a whim to stop in Caffe Victoria for a cappuccino.  It was the best decision of our day!  We loved the authenticity of the cafe.  There were people chatting in both English and Italian....which added to the experience.  The cappuccino was by far THE BEST we've ever had.  Perfect!  A must when in Boston!
40,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,12/13/2021,"This cafe was one of the highlights of our trip. Delicious coffees and desserts with cute vintage decor. We especially enjoyed the cappuccino and tiramisu. 
They only accept cash, so make sure you bring enough to buy different desserts! ;)"
41,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,6/13/2021,"Cash Only. When I went here I felt I was teleported back in time, it has a very old-time classic European cafe feel. Everything is very affordable, we got two teas (they use hot water and tea bags) and tiramisu, both very good"
42,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,2/4/2022,"Stopped here for hot cocoa during a rainy day. Delicious cocoa and great presentation. They also had the most appetizing desserts. Remember, it's cash only! Also important to note that this place is open late, which makes it the perfect slate night dessert spot"
43,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,11/19/2021,"Latte was good, ambiance is good as well. The back part not so, only because it smells like cigar, other than that, the vibe is very Italy! Less a star since they only accept cash and wont allow you to eat anything else, like the cannoli in the picture. As a tourist, we are disappointed."
44,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,9/28/2021,"Delicious coffee, dessert and very kitschy atmosphere that makes you feel like you're in Europe. Very nice spot for after dinner. I highly recommend caffe coretto with Fernet Branca. Cheesecake is gluten free if you don't eat the crust, and quite good. Reasonable prices, cash only, service is very casual, so don't be in a hurry."
45,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,4/2/2021,"Love Vittoria! I am in the neighborhood a lot, and this is the place we bring folks who are visiting us or we will go just because!  My favorite drink is the hot coco, hands down.  The pastry is always fresh and delicious and would rather be seated at old world charm Vittoria than any other coffee place in the N. End.  Suggestion is that the app menu have a full menu listing of what is offered and have prices of what is offered.  Staff are pretty nice and the place can be extremely busy. It is cash only, prices and full menu please."
46,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,8/22/2020,"The espresso martini was good. Tiramisu was only ok nothing more( although we heard amazing reviews on it).
The hazelnut ice cream was good but the pistachio was really not good, it didn't have the flavor of pistachio. This place takes only cash. There are seats inside and outside. I would give this place 3/5 also for social distancing."
47,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,1/25/2022,"This place was such a vibe. The whole place was packed with groups of people and the ambiance was super loud. We had to seat ourselves and wait for a waiter to approach us to take our order. For me this place wasn't much for the desserts or drinks they offered but the ambiance, although their desserts are pretty great too. We had so much fun just sitting there and being as loud without getting eyed by people and enjoying our treats. I loved the tiramisu, cotton candy gelato, and the cannoli. Only downside is that you'll probably have to wait forever to get your order taken and getting served. We went on a Monday night and it was full to the point that people were waiting outside in the line to get in."
48,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,1/17/2022,Honestly? BEST latte I've probably had from any restaurant. Just add one packet of sugar (obviously your preference) and your set. The place is small but definitely has such a Italian coffee shop vibe. Will continue to go back over and over (:
49,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,7/3/2021,"My wife and i ate here this afternoon for the first time. I had a Cappuccino, my wife a regular coffee. For a pastry i ordered the Chocolate Gannoche and my wife had the Tiramisu. He dessert didn't have the rum fflavor typical of Tiramisu and it was small. My dessert was pretty good. So was the Cappuccino. The total was $16.00. The only thing we were not satisfied with was the waitress. Our waitress walked over and just looked at us with a blank stare. We were the ones who had to engage her. She did not smile and was extremely impersonal. A real drag."
50,Caffé Vittoria,2 star rating,5/17/2021,"My wife and I were in the area and were looking for a little pick me up before our tour started later in the afternoon. We walked in and stood near the doorway before the waitstaff acknowledged us and finally told us to have a seat at any table. I ordered the cappuccino and my wife had the chinotto (Italian soda). It didn't take long for us to be ready to go, but the waitstaff never came to check on us again after being served the drinks. It got to the point where I went up to the counter to get the bill and pay just so that we could leave at a reasonable time. It was not a busy day, and I could see several waitresses playing on their phones instead of ensuring their customers were taken care of. While the drinks were tasty, if this is the typical experience Caffe Vittoria has to offer, I'd recommend taking your money elsewhere."
51,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,7/28/2021,"Grabbed a latte and an espresso with a buddy! Great flavor, beautiful decorations and a great view of Hanover street!"
52,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,2/28/2021,"A tried and true classic in the North End.  
No matter where you end up for dinner or lunch be sure to cap it off with dessert, coffee, or a cocktail here.
Very classic caffé decor and feel.  The wait staff are always great and attentive. 
Great beverage options and the baristas are always filling you up with whatever you need!"
53,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,9/29/2021,"No customer service. We bought some cannolis at Mike's Pastries and came inside with them and were ready to order.  We said we'd like to eat them outside and asked for outside seating, then were told to go outside and wait to be served. Fifteen minutes later we still had no one helping us so we went back inside and then were told again to go outside and wait to be served. Over ten minutes later no one came. Another party who came was instantly served when they sat down. By the time they came to us we had been waiting 30 minutes.  Upon asking for our order we were told there was a policy against eating outside food.... We should have left after waiting ten minutes but the reviews seemed very good.  In any case we were very annoyed at the lack of attention and just decided to leave."
54,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/28/2020,"Coffee in America has been morphed into a fast food experience where you wait in a line and receive a paper cup bearing your misspelled name. Coffee was meant to be drank in leisure over conversation while digesting an exquisite meal. The coffee should be meticulously crafted with quality ingredients and served in a cup that's not destined for a recycling bin the moment after you've taken your final sip. It should be enjoyed in an environment that is both lively and without a trace of precipitancy. The right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have, and a wonderful place to spend it is at Caffé Vittoria with spectacular coffee and companionship."
55,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/3/2021,"After searching for a aesthetically pleasing coffee shop online, I stumbled upon this one as well as a friend recommending it. It was a busy spot! But was such a cute shop to grab an iced coffee and dessert with some friends."
56,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/8/2020,"An old school coffee shop in Boston's North End.

Narrow inside with a few tables, along with outdoor seating. All old school coffee machines, some of which they still use! Service is fast and there is always a barista on hand to take your order. All drinks can be made iced, which is a selling point in my book. No extra charge for soy or almond milk, which is another selling point.

Definitely more of a grab and go type place with excellent coffee and even better prices. Two iced lattes with soy for $4!"
57,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,2/16/2022,Best espresso martini ever! Highly recommend coming here. Cute cafe atmosphere and great service
58,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,9/4/2021,"We walked in and were coldly greeted with the most unfriendly, dead-mackerel-eyed waitress. The café was not very busy but she obviously hated her job. And humans. She ignored us until we left without giving this place our business. Extremely rude."
59,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,7/6/2021,"I come here whenever I bring guests to the North End. It's a cozy, aesthetic place on the popular Hanover Street. 

The gelato is really rich, very delicious. The flavor is concentrated goodness. Everyone always enjoys the gelato. They give you tiny spoons so that you really savor every tiny bite. The drinks that I've had are also great, particularly the iced mocha. 

If you order an ice water, don't expect it to come quickly, but service is otherwise pretty fast. Cash only. I don't think they have prices for anything on the menu but everything drink or gelato that I've had is $4-5."
60,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,11/29/2021,"A great little spot to stop by after dinner for a cappuccino, some hot chocolate or a canoli. We loved the cozy, comfortable atmosphere."
61,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,1/20/2020,"Stopped by here after dinner with a friend and had an interesting experience. Ordered a latte and tiramisu.

Tiramisu was very good and the latte was great as well. Not too pricey but note that this place is cash only!

The inside has a louder than coffee shop chatter but lots of seating and really like how they set this place up.

My only caveat here is that the
moment we entered the cafe and while sitting inside the staff were a quite aggressive. Perhaps it was because it was the end of the night and they were ready to close, I don't know but that was not exactly the cafe experience I expected."
62,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,1/30/2022,By far the best cappuccino I've ever had! So good! Really cool environment too. Tiramisu and cannoli were good as well
63,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,10/14/2019,"Like everyone else says...
GET THE TIRAMISU!

I've had many tiramisus before and have also tried making it myself before too. Lemme tell ya, it's hard to perfect! This place holds #1 for the best tiramisu I've ever had. I tried to pace myself but it was gone in 5 minutes. The cappuccino was great too. Smooth, velvety, foamy on top with a decadent chocolate sauce on top. 

When you enter you can sit down wherever you'd like and someone will help you with your order. After you are done with your food/beverage they will give you a bill. This place is cash only so make sure you have some cash on you!"
64,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/30/2020,"Cash only, so don't come without. Good cappuccino and attentive staff. You can also get cookies and gelato. Sit inside or outside if the weather is nice."
65,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/9/2021,"A really cute cafe that my partner and I visited while we were waiting for our table in the area. It's cash only, and normally I wouldn't mess with a cash only business but tbh the coffee and pastries here are worth it. I got a latte and a dessert and it was fantastic! The atmosphere is amazing and the service is so nice. Couldn't recommend more."
66,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,10/24/2021,"Interior is very cool and different. Lots of foot traffic so definitely not a study area, more of a sit and chat area. I was told this was a must visit if you were in Boston. Coffee is decorated really uniquely, but tastes like your typical coffee. Smooth and not too sweet. We got the cappuccino and mocha. Only downside was that service was very slow, and no one really gave us a heads up about that. We sort of just sat and waited for twenty ish minutes. Also, they don't take card, only cash."
67,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,8/9/2020,"Classic Italian cafe with coffee and pastries. Cappuccino and iced coffee were excellent. Pastries were decent, not spectacular."
68,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,5/25/2021,"Great coffee both hot & ice, pretty much like what I had in Italy. Tiramisu and cannoli were also pretty tasty but not too sweet."
69,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,10/3/2019,"We ended up in this place for Limoncello and espresso after a fantastic dinner in Giacomos (they actually recommended us Caffe Vittoria, thank you!!!!) The place had that rustic and vintage. Seems a lot like a little cafe in Italy. We will be back!

Be aware, cash only. And musicians sometime around playing, so you might want to have cash too to tip them, they are amazing"
70,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,4/1/2021,"Let me tell you !!! I am not a fan of tiramisu, but the lady ( who I wish I knew her name ) recommended  it and I was like I guess I'll try. This was by far the best tiramisu I ever had . I had to order two ! We came after dinner here and it was busy , but no wait which was awesome. Also the drinks are pretty strong here , most of them are dessert type drinks."
71,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,6/30/2020,"Super nice place!! Great quality coffee! And awesome desserts!! We ordered 3 different ones because we couldn't choose just one :) tiramisu is amazing! And that was my first time trying lobster tail (for that reason I can't compare it to anything) buuuut highly recommended!!
Oh, and it's cash only place, so don't forget to bring your dollar bills :)"
72,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/12/2019,"For my experience, I really enjoyed ! Good spot to sit with opened-windows & friendly service. Of course, our local friends recommended & we loved it!  The whole area is so ""Little Italy""...atmospheric feel.

We got...coffee, espresso, cannoli, gelato, tiramisu...everything is held up its recommendations!"
73,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/30/2019,"Loved going to this little cafe after eating dinner in the North End. We paid $10 for 2 desserts plus tip, and were not disappointed. The tiramisu I ordered was creamy and delicious! The atmosphere of the cafe is very ""vintage Italy"", and is cute and cozy. I can't wait to take my friends/family here when they visit from out-of-state.

Service was great, but remember it's cash only!"
74,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/4/2019,"4.5 stars

Caffé Vittoria is a North End gem. Step in and you'll be transported to an old-timey Italian coffee shop that looks straight out a movie. The walls are lined with vintage memorabilia and oldies play in the background.

The price point is about right. I usually go for the cappuccino (dusted with cinnamon) and the tiramisu (fluffy and decadent). I tried a bite of my bf's strawberry cheesecake which was good (but surprisingly salty).

Half a star lost for service. Often times, it can be hard to flag down somebody to take your order."
75,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,6/19/2019,"A Large Hot Coffee from Caffe Vittoria. Extra Strong. The Stuff will put you on Mars... $3.50 well worth it.

I will have to go to Caffe Vittoria the next time i'm in the North End and try some of their Baked Tasty Goods.. Oh Yeah..!

Caffe Vittoria is also Wheelchair accessible although there is no power door. There is a steep Ramp to the door, so you will need help.

Inside be aware Caffe Vittoria space wise is a bit tight. But there is enough for a wheelchair to navigate the Space and the Staff is very accommodating. 

Note: Caffe Vittoria also has a Hidden tiny Vintage Coffee Museum in the back of the dining room. It's Cool.!"
76,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,12/20/2020,"I definitely enjoy caffe Vittoria for the ambiance and location. I prefer other local spots drinks and desserts more, however sometimes you just want a cute spot to sit after dinner and have an espresso and treat. When that feeling hits me, this is my go to spot. The service is fine - unremarkable. The prices are a little high for what you get, but that's probably due to the high rent on the location. Overall, it's definitely worth a stop - I'll leave it up to you if you work it in to your normal rotation."
77,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/15/2021,Still the best place for cappuccino or Espresso martinis ... or both.. we opted for both!
78,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,12/31/2020,"Must come!! Delicious hot chocolate. Cappuccino, Canolis, and chocolate martini. Every time I come to Boston I have to pass by here. Love the antique look of the place and the service is great too."
79,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,1/2/2022,"Best cappuccinos ever!  They were short staffed, so you do need to wait a little, but well worth it. Highly recommend! Servers were very kind."
80,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,5/3/2021,"BEWARE! None of the desserts are made in house. This place is a giant tourist trap. I sat and watched as they got a delivery of numerous boxes of Costco pre-made cakes and pastries. I also saw tons of frozen strawberry topping and nesquick. I did a quick google search and saw they won ""best  hot chocolate in Boston""... You all must really like nestle nesquick haha!! You have been warned"
81,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,2/14/2022,"We have been here probably 5 times over the years and here are my thoughts. So the 3 stars are for the desserts, everything else here I can do without. The desserts are undeniably the best part of this place. The downside, hectic, extremely noisy, and the tables are on top of each other. When you come here on Friday and Saturday nights it is not well organized when seating people at tables. There are 2 entrances and they allow people to enter in both. We walked in and were taken to a table by the hostess only to find that someone else seated people there or they walked in the other entrance and sat themselves. Service is hit or miss at best, never what I would consider good or great. Along with the service issues I have never met a friendly waitress. No smiles or exchanging pleasantries here. The drinks to me seem to be on the small side and weak. I have never had  coffee drink that I could taste a hint of alcohol. On top of all that it's cash only. If you want a better experience go in the afternoon or week days, avoid the weekend nights or take the desserts to go."
82,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,8/13/2021,"Good every time I come here.  I got tiramisu, and it was a little frozen but I understand that they are busy and probably have to cook in large batches and freeze.  Eclair and rum baba were good as well.  It was very busy so service was kind of slow, but again I understand that.  Highly recommend!"
83,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/25/2019,"There's something magical about a perfectly made cappuccino. The dusting of cocoa as you take a giant sip and the fluffy foam followed by a strong caffeinated river going down. 

This is the place for a pre dinner capp. Everyone comes to the North End for old school Italian grub. It's an absolute madhouse. You have to be prepared to wait. I would recommend having an espresso beverage before the dinner. While we were there the dinner crowd came stampeding in. 

So happy we got a table towards the front. Perfect for people watching and enjoying the cafe atmosphere. I wish we would have had room for dessert. The cannolis and the tiramisu looked mouth watering. 

I don't know what happened to modern day cafes but the legit old school Italian joint are unbeatable."
84,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,5/10/2021,"If you really want to die, go to Caffe vittotia. We found mold in our dessert! Mold!! How long was it there for? We don't know but our experience was so unpleasant that it almost made me vomit. The waitress offered an apology and she was ok. It was not her fault. However, the manager's attitude was like 'meh.. this happens frequently' ... he got this off the bill and we still paid for the other desserts and drinks we had. Are you kidding? We will avoid this place like the plague. What a disgrace."
85,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,11/30/2020,"Cafe Vittoria is a consummate Italian cafe with decorations spanning decades. The staff are very helpful and friendly, and the food is absolutely amazing!"
86,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,1/22/2020,"BC I'm basic and follow Thrillist like the bible, I succumbed to their recommendation to visit Cafe Vittoria. They describe the front door as almost a teleport, transporting visitors to a cafe in Italy itself. Well, I like to travel. I hope customs isn't strict bc my passport is currently in the possession of the USPS for renewal. 

There is a slight culture shock inside the place. The decor is unusual and quirky. We took a seat at one of their little cafe tables near a nook which has a mural of some Italian scene on it. I didn't inspect it because I was facing the other way and there were tables against the wall so that felt awkward to me. 

The menu has a ton of cafe beverages, as you probably expected. I, again being basic, ordered a cappuccino. The gelato case near the entrance put the idea of ice cream in my head and I conveniently remembered that it's been AGES since I've had sorbet. We went with mango. Finally, my GF brought their pastries to my attention. Lobster tail caught my attention. What the fuck is that doing on a pastry menu? I then received an education and for the sake of completion, had to try it of course. 

The waitresses were a bit bitchy, NGL. I took one for the team and ordered everything so my little lobster tail only ordered a glass of water which classically never came. 

The cappuccino was incredible. One of the best I've had in a long time. It was incredibly creamy and rich with a hint of chocolate (unless I'm hallucinating). The sorbet was very sweet but smooth and DELICIOUS. The lobster tail crust was flaky and crunchy. The cream inside was thick without being too heavy with a touch of sweetness. I couldn't decide whether I wanted to eat the dough or the cream more. I kept becoming overwhelmed with the richness of the pastry and halting my consumption but I kept coming back for more. It was actually so intense that I had planned all week to go to Magnolia later for one of their infamous banana puddings but literally had zero desire for any further dessert for the rest of the day. 

This is a GEM. Every trip to Boston requires a visit to this place and the espresso beverages are a must."
87,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,5/27/2019,"Boy do I wish this place existed for me back home. I absolutely LOVED the ambiance and setting of this cozy cafe. The space is small, intimate, and bustling with happy diners enjoying amazing pastries and coffees. You must try the cannoli - it is to die for. Best I've ever had! 

The spot is cash only, so be prepared!"
88,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,12/28/2019,"So I came here to just a slice of teramisu to go. First off, the customer service was a little rude. We were standing by the bar to order, and no one was paying attention to take our order. When a waitress finally asked what we wanted, she told one of the kids behind the bar to give it to us and take our payment. This kid wasn't even paying attention with his iPod buds in his ear. I waved him down at the counter and asked him what the cost was. 

He gave me the wrong change so I asked him what the cost was again showing the change, and he just stared as if I was crazy. After going back and forth multiple times, I ended up just letting it go. 

The teramisu wasn't very impressive either. Never coming back here again.

Don't think it's worth coming here."
89,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,7/3/2021,This place is as Italian as it gets! Authentic cappuccinos/lattes and pastries. Nice touch with adding cocoa powder to the top of the cappuccino. Fantastic.
0,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,11/24/2021,"Really good spot on Hanover street. 
This wasn't the first place I wanted to try when I moved to the neighborhood. I think this was because the sign kinda looks like a Mexican place and then it's Italian so my brain was a little confused. 
Well... it was delicious. My bolognese was so good and we got a nice bottle of red to split as well. Our waitress was so nice and the place is adorable on the inside. 
Awesome spot for a low key Italian dinner in the north end!"
1,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,2/27/2022,"Tried Cantina Italiana for dinner a few weeks ago and was excited by the reviews! The service was decent, just wanted to give a shout out to the waiters that refilled our waters, they were really on top of it and I don't think my cup ever went empty. 

We got the Nutella martini, the bolognese and the salmon pasta dish. For the Nutella martini it was interesting but I feel like the alcohol in it was a bit overwhelming and the cocktail was a bit messy in that it was dripping on the side of the cup and my hands got really sticky. 

As for the pasta dishes the salmon was well cooked and the pasta noodles were also well cooked. However the sauces were very subpar, the bolognese didn't really have that meaty flavor that I was hoping for.

Overall the experience was decent but I'm not sure that the food taste and quality measured up to the price we paid."
2,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,2/4/2022,"I wasn't blown away by this place but it's nice in the inside, has a nice bar area and my food was good enough to be a 4. My issue was the service was terrible. I'll admit I was in for an early dinner, like 4PM, and they all seemed distracted by setting up for the dinner rush than paying any attention to the couple early customers they had already, including me. Not sure the issue but every step was slow, getting me a menu, getting me a drink, ordering, my food coming out, refilling my drink and getting my check when I was done. Everything was slow it was like I was invisible. At one point I just wanted another drink and I literally couldn't even get the bartender to glance at me for 10 minutes. 

The food, albeit a long wait, was solid. Nothing spectacular and plenty better in the North End but good. I especially liked the pasta fagioli soup I got before my meal. Again, had I gotten a little attention in the service I probably would give it a 4. Maybe just an off night as far as that goes? Unsure."
3,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,11/16/2021,"Scored a 6pm reservation for 4 for a celebratory dinner. When we arrived we were quickly seated at a small booth. Luckily we were able to move to a slightly more spacious table towards the back, though be prepared to be in close quarters with other parties. They really want it to feel like you're eating at grandma'a house here, so try to get comfortable. 

We started with a few spritz cocktails and the calamari and the prosciutto mozzarella appetizers. The drinks were tasty and not too strong. The calamari was a verrry small portion for the cost, but pretty tasty. The prosciutto and mozzarella was pretty basic. Just exactly as described. The waiter was frequently asking if we were ready to order entrees, so we appeased him and did.

For mains, we all ended up with bombolotti dishes. Mine included the lobster tail, shrimp and tomato sauce. Pretty tasty, though not very spicy as he warned. The shells were on both the shrimp and lobster. The pasta shape is a fun treat, but overall the portions weren't big enough to satisfying the hungry men in my party. 

Overall not a very classy celebration I hoped for, felt rushed by the waiter, but was fun to try a historic pasta dish in the North End."
4,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,9/23/2021,"We popped in here for a drink and an appetizer. 
If you're looking for an amazing bruschetta and a refreshing cocktail, this is the spot.

I'm so glad we picked this spot."
5,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,12/13/2021,"This was a great place to go on a Saturday night for some great italian food. I loved this place! The service was great and the pasta was very authentic. I also got an espresso martini and that was perfect. You have to make a reservation or else you are not going to get a seat. I made one about two weeks prior so I definitely recommend getting in your reservation ASAP!
Ambiance is great and it was fun to be in the North End."
6,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,6/4/2021,"We specifically chose this restaurant due to its long standing history in the North End and are happy we did.  We landed here 2/3rds into our Freedom Trail walk.  It was early afternoon on a weekday so not too busy and we were probably all tourists!  We were seated immediately and brought water (score).  It is hard to explain, but bringing me water right away always sets a positive tone to my dining experience... might also have been that we had been walking for a couple hours and I was thirsty!

We ordered some Calamari, a Caesar salad and a couple of dishes -- the Cioppino and Gnocchi al Forno (with shrimp).  SO delicious... ALL of it.  I absolutely loved the Caesar Salad -- when done right and with homemade dressing that is not too heavy it is perfection and they nailed it.  We had the Tiramisu for dessert and that too was fantastic."
7,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,11/8/2021,"Fantastic  food wine and service in a building that hasn't been remodeled in decades. Remember your here for the food, not the ambiance - everything came out fresh and delicious! Our server Omar was a pro and handled everything with ease!"
8,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,3/5/2021,"Food was average or slightly above among north end restaurants.  We added $7 or so for half portion of the truffle gnocchi, which turned out to be the best (both taste and value). 

What was concerning was the practice during the pandemic.  MA and Boston requires 25% maximum capacity and 90min limited dining time. Cantina is for sure not enforcing either."
9,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,1/31/2021,"Dined here last night. Fatima helped us--she's very nice and provide great recommendations.

Cantina Italians is advertised to be the oldest restaurant in the North End--we'll take it. Worth trying considering the ease of reservation and decent reviews on Yelp, as well as on other platforms. 

Food was delicious. See pictures. 

As for pandemic handling (12/30/2021) - One concern we have is whether the restaurant actually comply with the 25% max capacity. We were one of the first guests, but when we were done, almost every table was occupied. It did not look like 25% max capacity to us. They might've overbooked or did not turn newer customers away when arrived.  Place was, I must say, really crowded. Menu should be switched to 1-time used paper menu rather than reusable plastic menus. Plus side, there's hand sanitizer on every table."
10,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,2/5/2022,"Good authentic Italian North End spot! Great food, reasonable prices and out standing service"
11,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,11/1/2020,"After living out of state for the last two years I was really excited to return and enjoy a meal in the North End. The experience is a little different now due to the increased outdoor seating on the already crowded streets, but generally the good food and old-fashioned italian vibes are still there. I enjoyed my meal at Cantina Italiana aside from a few small hiccups, including a large party of loud birthday-celebrators (which was not the restaurant's fault but stricter limitations on group size/noise level would be appreciated). In general I was a little surprised at how close together the tables were inside the restaurant, given the current social distancing guidance.

Not every pasta dish on their menu contains pasta handmade on site (understandable given their size), so I specifically tried the Bombolotti Alla Buongustaia because it was described as their signature house-made pasta with handmade sausage. All the flavors together were SO tasty and that house-made bombolotti was in fact bomb. Definitely would get this again!

I also tried the Scialatelle with Salmon, also described on the menu as house-made. The pasta itself was good, but unfortunately the sauce was lackluster. It was salvaged by adding salt to bring out the mild flavor that was there, but really could have used some more robust seasoning."
12,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,1/4/2022,"We had a great experience at dinner tonight with our server Omar! He was fun and very polite! We have came here several times and he always is very nice and personable with us, even when it is very busy! We would definitely come back here again. The food is amazing as well as the service!"
13,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,4/11/2021,"This is not the place to be if you're looking to get martinis. Started with a cosmopolitan that came out sweet and nothing like what it's supposed to taste like. Espresso martini was on the lighter side with almost no espresso just a lot of baileys. 
They need a better system put in place for hectic weekend nights. I watched our appetizers be brought to multiple tables before getting to us. 
The truffle fries & prosciutto and mozz were the only things I would recommend getting. 
As plates were being brought out, the cacio e Pepe looked yummy but actually was the opposite. Noodles were too hard and the plate was warm so the cheese was getting sticky. Little to no taste, would not recommend."
14,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,10/24/2021,They made me a custom spaghetti and clam sauce a mix between red and white. It was so good better then I expected i would highly recommend it. my waiter Manny was excellent
15,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,9/6/2021,"This review is about the very messed up person who takes reservations and seats you, we didn't even make it  inside the restaurant because of her aggression towards us. We didn't feel safe going in because she was physically aggressive. If you catch her on a bad day she might end up ruining your evening so bear that in mind while making a reservation at this place. There are multiple reviews calling her out and I've never been treated this horribly anywhere so am gonna take the good money I was about to drop here, to so many other incredible places in the area.

We went there on a super busy night were walking to the check in counter outside the restaurant on the pavement when I saw a crazy lady yelling at the long line of customers waiting patiently and adhering to social distancing. *she did not have a mask on and was yelling so much her  spittle was flying at people*. She was unraveling and clearly needed to be sat down and taken care of or given a break to collect herself as she was abusing everyone at the restaurant and creating a huge scene outside ruining the experience of the people who had gotten in and were looking for a nice evening. 

We walked up to get to check in and instead of explaining the next steps and where to wait she started yelling at us without understanding that we were just looking to her guidance. I am still shaking and can't make sense of anything that happened. We just walked off after she started spitting at us because my family's health is paramount and no meal is worth contracting covid."
16,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,9/25/2021,"We made a reservation for 8:15 but weren't seated until 9:00pm and weren't fed until 10:00pm. Pasta was good and portions were large, but the wait was too long! If there weren't a wait, it'd be a 4.5/5 instead.

PS - ambiance is homey but loud"
17,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,3/20/2022,"So far the worst place we have been to in the North End. We had a reservation, but there was no table for us (~30min wait outside). The worst, however, was the food: the least authentic pasta carbonara with cream (why?!) and almost no bacon for the amount of pasta, and the cacio e peppe was basically just plain pasta with a few ungrounded pepper corns. But that was not all. The wine (Barbera) was undrinkable and the prosecco was completely flat like a white wine. How on Earth can this place survive?! There are so many gems out there in the North End (Carmelina's, Giacomo's, Neptune, ...), just don't waste your time or money here..."
18,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,12/27/2021,We dined at Cantina Italianna on Christmas Day. I ordered Saltimbiccq Chicken - pan seared chicken and sautéed with foraged mushrooms in a marsala wine sauce topped with Prosciutto di Parma and mozzarella. The dish was great. Bigger portion compared to those served in New York.
19,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,11/27/2021,"We had a reservation, they told us that reservations are first come first serve. Sorry what is the point of a reservation? This place is a fucking scam why do you have reservations if they're not reserved for people who actually made them. Host staff is just as useless and unaccomdating. We were one minute late after getting a text that said our table was ready and by the time we got there they already gave our table away. Their  host was laughing at us. I hope you all choke on your meatballs."
20,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,11/27/2021,I would give them 0 stars if I could. We had a reservation at 7:30 and we got to the hostess stand and the hostess said our reservations don't necessarily mean that you will be seated at that time and that we would have to show up within ten minutes once we were notified that our table was ready... we waited patiently for the table and were texted that our table was ready and when we walked over within 30 seconds... they gave away our table. This restaurant has the most unprofessional hostess who also chose to laugh at the situation when we were waiting in below freezing temperatures for over 30 minutes.
21,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,6/17/2021,"I literally have never been as disappointed as this meal.   The location was recommended by locals, and even our hotel.  
Each sauce tasted the exact same (alla vodka / spaghetti sauce) and the noddles were over cooked and mushy.  
We hoped for fresh hot bread at the table, and that was not the case.  
It was the ONLY meal during our five days in Boston that we regretted.  It still upsets me that we spent $145 for a family of four on what we hoped would have been our favorite meal."
22,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,7/12/2021,"This was amazing restaurant as the meal was full of flavor, and cooked perfectly. The device was attentive and joyful. Highly recommend this great place. Also not overpriced, worth every penny!"
23,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,7/6/2021,"We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience here! Was it the best Italian food I've ever had? No, but it was incredibly delicious and everyone was happy. We had the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer, lasagna, fettuccine carbonara, vodka sauce and spaghetti in my group. Generous portion sizes! The service was excellent too. They were out of bread but then told us they called local bakeries to see what they could find for us. It just showed they cared. Some of the outdoor tables were slanted and I saw two different cocktail glasses slide off the table and shatter."
24,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,9/18/2021,We got there not too long after they opened so there was no wait. All of the staff was very friendly and attentive. Our waitress was funny and enjoyable. The food was delicious and did not take long to get.
25,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,10/9/2021,"Oh my goodness! My husband and I came up from DC to visit family in Boston this weekend. My brother-in-law from NY made the trip with us. The ultimate goal - find the best Italian food in the north end. We succeeded. Cantina Italiana was, quite literally, the best I've ever had. And we have to give the goddess who makes this place run so beautifully SO MUCH love. Maria Delvecchio is an absolute queen. She made our visit so incredibly special. We love you, Maria. We'll see again you soon, Cantina Italiana!"

28,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,10/10/2021,"WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!

This is only my second review, so bear with me...  No reservations and while second in  line, we witnessed a bitter, old hostess/owner berating a server and then complaining about her to the first in line customers.  We were told 10-15 minutes for a table.  After 30 minutes of people watching (the location IS great) and hearing the hostess saying there was no wait, I asked and we were immediately seated. My first WETF.  The berating continued...  Imagine eating at a ""quaint Italian restaurant and hearing yelling from the hostess, ""YOU GOTTA KEEP THE AC ON!  YOU GOTTA KEEP THE AIR FLOWING!  Or ""WE GOT A PARTY OF 13 COMING IN!  DO THIS AND THIS AND THAT!""  My second WTF.

I was embarrassed for myself.  Why didn't I speak up?  ""STOP OPENLY CRITISIZING YOUR STAFF TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!  WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENJOY A NIGHT OUT!  And/or ""COULD YOU KEEP IT DOWN WHILE WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENJOY A MEAL OUT?"" 

The food?  Poor at best.  Maybe it was what we ordered.  The $35 veal was dry and tasteless, the pasta was overcooked and miniscule (isn't pasta cheap?) and the sauce tasted burnt.  My ultimate WFT.

Other than our server, EVERYTHING SUCKED!!!"
29,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,7/5/2021,"What a treat. Yummy food, generous portions, attentive service, options for eating inside or out. What's not to love?"
30,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,11/3/2021,My wife and I got lucky when we chose this restaurant! This is a true North End gem. The restaurant is very authentic and the food and wine were excellent. If you are ever in Boston make sure that you go there for a nice dinner!
31,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,9/19/2021,"Service was delayed but food was solid! Waited 30mjn past our reservation to be seated and 35 minutes after ordering for food (nothing too crazy on a Saturday night). Mariana our server was friendly. Hostess definitely was not, but she was able to manage the large amount of folks waiting for their tables so it was effective. For the price and atmosphere, maybe I'd try somewhere else when I return to the North End, but being able to make a reservation was a plus."
32,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,12/8/2019,"The North End is filled with its hits and misses, sprinkled in between the classics like Mike's Pastry and Vittoria Cafe, but Cantina is a total home run in my carb-loving book of Best Italian Eats. I came here for my birthday dinner and it's like being transported to old Italy -- you walk into the sounds of Italian being spoken, smell the comforting zing of tomato sauce, and imagine someone's nonna cooking up a homemade pasta dish for you. There's a certain charm to the whole place that I haven't really found replicated in any other restaurant in Little Italy. 

Maybe it's the booths -- being seated in one puts you in a little world of your own, where despite it being super busy / a packed house, you feel like you can have an intimate conversation with your table, and savor over all the dishes you ordered together, sharing pieces of your dish with your friends and family, just like you'd imagine a homey Italian dinner.

We were on a time crunch with tickets to a show, but somehow our (amazingly efficient / sweet) waiter was able to work with the kitchen to get our dishes out quickly and impeccably cooked. 

I had the Bombolotti alla Buongustaia (Bombolotti pasta, spicy Italian sausage, fresh basil, marinara sauce, parmigiano), while we shared a few apps I can barely recall since we devoured them so quickly. I had never had bombolotti, but this was hands down my favorite of everything we ordered. The pasta was cooked SO perfectly, and that sauce! Suffice to say, I'll never train for a sprint or a marathon, but I can proudly say I can devour a multi-course Italian meal in under 45 minutes. Which should be record-holding, in some country, I'm sure. 

It's generally impossible to get my niece to a) eat her dinner or b) talk to any strangers, and she literally left hi-fiving the waiter and saying how amazing the spaghetti was, so home run it is:)."
33,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,9/26/2021,It won't let me leave a 1/2 star but these people SUCK SUCK SUCK Had us wait 40 minutes for a table then after an hour of waiting for our food they came to us to say they lost the ticket and no one made our food. AND they wouldn't rush it so it would be another 30-40 minutes and suggested we go eat somewhere else!! I literally hate you people.
34,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,8/29/2021,"Not a great experience. For starters, none of the waitstaff nor the hostess were wearing masks. They didn't even acknowledge it when we all had ours on. The Covid test positivity rate is 6.4% in the North End right now...
Beyond our fears that we were contracting Covid, we were disappointed in the service and the food. The drinks came quickly enough, but we waited a full hour for our food. The pasta fagioli soup had nearly any flavor. We never got the parm cheese we requested. The spaghetti and meatballs were very average and the spaghetti was slightly hard. The worst part, however, was the gnocchi. It was undercooked and the insides were powdery and dry. We were definitely disappointed overall, and the bill was huge and felt entirely not worth the $. Sad because it was our last big night out in the North End and we wished we had gone back to Monica! Next time..."
35,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,11/25/2021,I haven't been there since I left Massachusetts the food it was delicious the service was fantastic the place brought back so many memories.
36,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,12/27/2021,"For being an Italian restaurant in the North End this was just ok. I ordered penne arrabbiata, the sauce itself had fine taste but it was not spicy at all and there were slices of jalapeño peppers in the dish. I love jalapeños but the menu said nothing about them and they're not traditionally in an arrabbiata sauce. I'm giving our waitress the benefit of the doubt and assuming based on service she was very new. She only listed 1 special while the table behind us heard 4 specials from their waiter, she told us there was no more soup and we watched multiple tables (who were seated after us) get delivered the same soup we asked for...maybe it was just an off night for them. If you're looking for an old school Italian feel this restaurant definitely has that vibe."
37,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,12/17/2021,"Originally, they were accommodating and took us 20 minutes late from our reservation. The food was great and we had a great time. As we were finishing our drinks, we were told we needed to hurry up and were rushed out of the restaurant. Did not appreciate the lack of accommodation to us finishing up our drinks and dinner."
38,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,10/16/2021,"Quite the crowd outside waiting for a table at 7 pm  Dined here last night while vacationing in Boston.  As good as any place in little italy in NY.  Very good apps, pasta and veal entrees and attentive service."
39,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,10/26/2021,One of the best Italian restaurants we ate at on our recent trip to Boston. Delicious food and their fresh soft pasta is always a plus.  The hostess was hilarious and the ambience was relaxed yet refined. Cannot wait to return to get more pasta
40,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,7/18/2021,We went here for my wife's Birthday and while the food was great the overall experience was not great.  The woman working at the outdoor desk told me check in for the reservation was at the bar which it was not it ended up being at the outdoor desk. The same lady came up to me when I was going back to the check in and grabbed me very inappropriately. I asked for a manager and the worker I asked introduced me to Omar as a manager.  Omar was very apologetic but the lady seemed to not care at all. When we finally checked in for our reservation the workers out there were apologetic. My point is if you are going to spend $$$ on a nice night out don't roll the dice on possibly getting a lady who is going to be rude with unwelcome touching.  It's sad because for special dinners this was our place for the past 6 years and now it's not.
41,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,7/31/2021,Do not order from this restaurant on any food courier app. The food was absolutely appalling. I never knew salmon could have a rubbery texture until I ordered from here today. The food was not packaged correctly therefore it did not taste fresh nor did it look appetizing. I ended up trashing $80 worth of food. Don't waste your money.
42,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,7/12/2020,"It feels great to be back in the North End!  Came here for a Friday night meal with some friends and we loved it.  Come while the weather is great and grab a seat outside.  

I was with a group of three, and we started with the Polpette meatballs and they were fantastic.  Conveniently they came with three, one for each of us in the party.  The food comes out quickly and hot.  For my main dish, I ordered the Cacio E Pepe and it was fantastic.  I'm a bit biased because this is my favorite pasta dish, but WOW!  Not only were they heavy on the cheese, the dish had whole black peppercorns in it.  I went halfsies on Pappardelle Bolognese with my friend, and again, that was also great.  The pasta was fresh, light, and cooked perfectly al dente.  

Great spot to hit with family or friends.  They have a great cocktail selection (they make a mean espresso martini), and a good assortment of Italian wines.  All the waiters were in masks, and they had hand sanitizers at each table.  Overall great experience, can't wait to go again."
43,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,11/27/2021,hostess was horrible. Reservation didn't mean anything. laughed in our faces as we waited patiently
44,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,7/17/2021,"Excellent experience at Cantina , loved the food and Maria our server was over the top awesome, would highly recommended."
45,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,7/11/2021,"Seats were all broken, one cheek on concrete, one cheek in an abyss of loose, ripped leather. Watered down drinks, as in you order drinks and receive water. Pathetic risotto, and oil drenched spinach. Salmon was crispy and good, but that's only if you're willing to wait an hour for food. Disappointment of a lifetime. Would rather eat plane food, which is actually good these days. At least it wasn't too expensive. Don't waste your time."
46,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,7/4/2021,Horrible spaghetti and even worse lasagna. It was the worst  Italian food I've ever had.  Long wait as well.  I sent back the lasagna to the kitchen. There are better options for Italian. Avoid!
47,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,6/14/2020,"So excited to dine in the North End again! Props to Cantina Italiana for serving their full menu, both food and drink, despite the reduction in tables from the pandemic. The outdoor seating is a little closer than other places I've seen due to limited real estate on Hanover Street, but I felt and that everyone out was keeping respectable distances.

The staff was fantastic, our waiter was very attentive and gave great recommendations. They gave us fresh bread and oil for the table. I ordered a Harry's Bellini to drink and the Bombolotti alla Buongustaia pasta dish for my lunch. I would recommend both, I was completely satisfied with my meal. The pasta is a heavy dish that came out in a sizzling hot pan with layers of gooey goat cheese and spicy sausage baked in. I'll definitely be back!"
48,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,10/2/2019,"Delicious food but unfortunately also an extremely long wait to get said food!

I came with two friends on a Sunday night and we were seated immediately, but our food took more than 30 minutes to be served. Perhaps this was exacerbated by the fact that we sat right next to where the food comes out of the kitchen so we were disappointed many times as servers came out with food but it wasn't ours.

In addition, my friend somehow got a half order instead of a full order. The bad news is that as a result the full order took an additional 10 minutes to come out (the other two of us were almost done with our food by the time his full order came out). The good news is that the waitress was able to get him an extra large order as compensation.

I had the shrimp scampi and would definitely recommend it to anyone who comes here. The noodles are well cooked and the sauce is well flavored -- not too salty or oily but still flavorful.

Besides food taking a long time to be served, service was good. We had complimentary bread and our waters were refilled promptly throughout the meal.

I would give this place another try but only if I have a lot of time to spare and good company to come with."
49,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,6/4/2021,"Don't go here. Super unsanitary, lipstick stain on the glass. Told our waitress and she said it's happened 6x this week!! Food is mediocre at best, I can make it better myself and I'm not even Italian. Don't go here."
50,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,7/8/2020,"This was one of the few restaurants that was not packed in North End on a weekend night! For that I am grateful, the pasta was good although the service could be better. We were seated in a place that was hard to see, so it wasn't too big of a deal. The flavors weren't too strong, but I didn't mind and overall I would come again!"
51,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,8/25/2021,"Good solid offering in the North End.  We were a group of 4.  We arrived around 5pm on a Tuesday.  We were able to get an outdoor table.  

In general, service was good, other than not clearing away the appetizer plates before the main course arrived, which made us do some gymnastics with plates.  Otherwise, we were provided bread, water glasses were regularly filed, drinks/refills from the bar arrived on-time.  The waitress checked on us often as expected and meals/courses arrived hot.

Food was very good.  Portions were appropriate.  Nobody in our group left unhappy or hungry.  

I would certainly return.  Nothing significant to complain about.  Perfect, no, but very good yes."
52,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,10/17/2021,"I couldn't decide whether to give this place 2 or 3 stars. We had an 8:30 reservation on a Saturday night. After telling the hostess we had a reservation, she pointed at a line to stand on. After about 20 minutes, we asked how long the line will take. The same hostess said there were no lines and we had to check in, after pointing us to a line and not asking to check us in before. Later on, without any provocation, she tells me I am acting rude and that will not help her get us a table any sooner. It's good to note at this point there were 2 girls who had been sitting with their check waiting for someone to collect their cards for about 30 minutes. Right in front of the hostess's face. Anyway, after another few minutes on line, the hostess came up to me and started telling me it's not her fault the restaurant is packed and then she grabbed both my cheeks and pinched them. (Covid?) Again, whatever, just trying to get inside and enjoy some food. 
We finally got seated in the way back of the restaurant right next to the kitchen. The kitchen door slammed loudly about every 45 seconds. It took forever to get our wine and the prosciutto and mozz was nothing special. My main course of steak had a sauce that tasted exactly like this chicken sauce I make that I found online. It's a good thing it's a delicious sauce! Our dessert drink, a Nutella martini, was delicious. The pasta dishes were creative shapes and cooked perfectly, but the vodka sauce was nothing special. Throughout the meal, the hostess who I imagine is also the manager, would walk throughout the restaurant rearranging tables. When talking to a server she dropped a very loud F bomb while yelling at him. When they would rearrange tables, they paid no mind to the patrons sitting around, bumping into them with the chairs they were moving. Our waitress was very sweet though. On second thought, i don't know why I even thought of 3 stars. Definitely 2 stars. Terrible service and atmosphere, but the food was pretty good."
53,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,12/29/2021,My experience was terrible. My water glass looked as if someone's lip prints were on it. The service was terrible. I'm still waiting for the bread to be brought to my table. Part of the ceiling looked as if it was going to fall. My chicken dish had a ton of oregano. It is definitely off my list.
54,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,12/27/2021,Amazing food and drinks but the service was super slow - still will go back though!!! Highly recommend anything with truffle or their house made pasta!! Loved the espresso martinis!!
55,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,3/31/2021,"We are so glad to have happened upon this spot for dinner with our family of four. They were incredibly accommodating and welcomed us (even with two young children) warmly. Not only was the service attentive, the food was excellent. Even a simple pasta with marinara for our children was wonderfully seasoned and you could tell the sauce had been cooked down for hours. The salmon was a hit with the entire family and our starters of broccoli and mushrooms were some of the best we have had. We highly recommend. It made our North End evening (and it's right down the street from Mike's, which was a score)!"
56,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,3/28/2020,"Excellent dinner all around beginning with the service.

Everyone's meals ranged from very good to terrific. I got the terrific one!  Mine was fusili boscaila (pardon the spelling) - pasta with sausage and greens. The overall dish came together in a fine combination of flavor.

This restaurant features a healthy wine list ranging from about $35 a bottle to $150. Dinner ranged form about $20-$35 but mostly in the low 20s. 

Did I mention the large dessert drink selection? Love it.

I would absolutely come back!"
57,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,10/17/2021,We had reservations for 8:30 didn't get sat until around 9:20. Would not recommend for someone who would find this irritating or inconvenient.
58,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,3/28/2021,"Worst experience I've ever had in the North End. Don't bother making a reservation because they won't honor it.

We had a reservation for 8 pm and had to wait outside because of Covid rules (not a problem). The hostess was rude and unprofessional and was taking people based on how big their party was - saying they could seat a party of 6 that just showed up because that was the table size they had available (we were a party of 2). She wasn't using any of the party names and it was visibly confusing to everyone waiting outside. It made no sense and was basically first come first serve. So we were sat around 8:45 pm.

The reason we came here is because the website showed they were serving the Dine Out Boston menu even on Saturdays. Our waitress said they weren't, and when I told her they had been advertising it she said she ""didn't really know"". 

Their Covid procedures are also spotty. We were in a corner RIGHT next to a party at the bar. Capacity limits have been lifted in Massachusetts but tables are still supposed to be six feet apart. Most here weren't. They also let us order drinks and leave without ordering food (which we were happy about because we didn't want to order off the regular menu) but that's also illegal.

There are plenty of places in the North End you can get friendly service and great food - so don't bother with here."
59,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,3/20/2021,"Worst experience I've had at a restaurant in the North End. 

Overall, the staff seemed quite nice, but the managers were not, and the restaurant itself seemed incredibly poorly run. With all the great options in the North End; I'd say to avoid this one at all costs.

I planned on coming here for Dineout Boston. My girlfriend checked ahead that they had their Dineout Boston menu available for Saturday's, and the website confirmed they did. So, I booked a reservation for 6:15. We got there for 6:10 with a conglomerate of people standing outside waiting. I thought, ""Oh, good thing I made a reservation before had."" But, when I went to check in with the manager, she told me, rather rudely, to step aside and step-down as she wanted to get a group of people in after essentially scolding me for nothing. She apologized, then went inside. The kind woman at the front desk then checked me in. 

We had to wait until 6:45 before FINALLY getting the 6:15 table I reserved. As soon as we were seated, we told the waitress we wanted the Dineout Boston menu. She then had to walk over to the same manager from earlier, and we heard the manager say they weren't doing that menu tonight. We then discussed with a separate manager how the website specially says the Dineout Boston is listed as a option today; only to be told tough luck. So, we left. 

We have a sneaking suspicion that they purposely overbook people and had that Dineout menu listed even though it wasn't available, just to get people in the door and force a Sunk Cost fallacy on them to stay and order far more expensive food."
60,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/19/2021,"I booked a business dinner for 16 out of towners.   I have heard nothing but raves about the experience and the food.    The staff is very attentive and every detail was taken care of.   This was the perfect ""North End Experience"" without a crazy, over the top price.  

Thank you!"
61,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/17/2021,The service was amazing and very quick! The food came in large portion sizes and were very flavorful. Highly recommend the pasta dishes along with the calamari! There are both indoor (with open windows) and outdoor seating.
62,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/17/2021,"Delicious food! Our waitress was lovely but a little slow with service but the food was outstanding! We started with peach bellinis, cosmos and the bruschetta. Both cocktails were amazing and the bruschetta was some of the best i've ever had. Each piece had individual balls of mozzarella and the tomatoes were marinated in a touch of balsamic and olive oil. I ordered a dish with pesto, burrata and pine nuts served in a pan. It was delicious!! My friends ordered the carbonara and chicken parm. Both equally delicious and the carbonara was my favorite! We will be returning, hopefully soon!"
63,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,10/12/2021,Well what can I say. You would think that I. Little Italy in Boston you could get good food. Not at this place. Service was good but my bolognese had absolutely no flavor.  I make a better sauce by far. My husbands scampi was bland also.
64,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,9/12/2021,"I rarely write reviews unless something is outstanding.  This was such a bad embarrassing experience that I am making an exception.

We were visiting Boston and wanted an authentic Italian dinner in the North End.  The hotel concierge made reservations.  We had guests - Close family friends who've been in Boston for 2 years for law school with a 7 month old.  Three of us got out of the car to let them know we were there for our reservation and let us know where my husband could park the car - as we didn't know there was no parking - we are from out of state. When we walked up the Hostess was screaming at two waitresses - belittling them in front of all the restaurant guests who were sitting outside.  After a few moments we asked her where to park and she chewed our heads off.  We said here for our reservation and she yelled at my guests for standing on the sidewalk being in the way of her waiter.  If the restaurants around us hadn't looked over crowded and we hadn't had a 7 month old with us, I would have walked away.  She continued to berate staff throughout the evening and continued her absolute rudeness to us through out.  When our waiter did not come back for almost 30 minutes we asked her to send over our waiter and she screamed that we sent him away.  Which we did by asking him to give us a minute to look at the menu but not 20-30 minutes.  

Once we ordered and the food finally came - all of the dishes were bland and the sauces all tasted like the same dish.  The ""homemade"" pasta noodles were gooey and somewhat stuck together.  And the noise was so loud we could barely hear ourselves talk and had to keep asking the waiter to repeat himself.  The cost for this rude experience and mediocre food was about $180 for four people with no alcohol ordered.  Just 4 pasta dishes, 1 salad, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert. +$24 to park at the Waterfront.  I asked the kids who had been living in Boston - is this an Italian thing, a Boston thing, or is this lady as rude I think.  The answer -  Just her - VERY RUDE HOSTESS; VERY OVERPRICED; VERY MEDIOCRE FOOD. DON""T WASTE YOUR EVENING."

Had to pay $25 to park , which is probably what my dinner was worth ( for two people). Had the Pesto ( very dry ), caprisse salad ( mozzarella and tomatoes cut way to thick )and cannoli. Don't believe the hype . They are trying I give them that ."
66,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,1/25/2019,"WOW! What an amazing Italian restaurant located in the North End of Boston! We found this place after doing our research on Yelp (of course!), and we are glad we did! I would definitely recommend reservations, as they are pretty busy on most nights. We did have to wait a little bit even though we had a reservation, but it was worth it. 

The host really made us feel like we were in an authentic Italian restaurant. He was very friendly and his accent was everything! We sat in a cute little booth that had coat hangers on the end (a first for me, being from Florida). Our waitress was little flustered, but we didn't take it personally and still enjoyed our meal. 

I enjoyed a glass of wine, while my boyfriend tried their mule and a bourbon spice. He said he wouldn't get the bourbon spice again, but the mule was great. I ordered the gnocchi, and let me tell you it was the best one I have ever had. It was made in house and the sauce was just to die for. My boyfriend got the spaghetti with red sauce, and he said the fresh pasta was perfect. 

We were too full for dessert, but they do have a promising menu. Overall, amazing Italian restaurant with authentic cuisine. You can't go wrong with this place!"
67,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,8/28/2020,"4.5
Very well spaced outdoor dining area (considering the whole situation with COVID-19). The food was phenomenal and the waiter was very attentive. My only issue was with the portion size: the plates were huge which made the actual food look tiny. The gnocchi that I ordered was fantastic but seemed way too little for 26 dollars. Other than that, everything else was amazing, I highly recommend visiting!"
68,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,8/22/2020,"I made a reservation in advance for 8:30pm on a Friday night for a special occasion. Upon arrival we were told to wait in line as it was ""First come first serve"", according to the manager. We ended up waiting for half an hour, in the same line with people who didn't make a reservation at all. (I wasn't even asked for my name for verification) 
After waiting in the heat for 30 minutes, the evening was pretty much ruined.
It is very wrong and misleading for a restaurant to make themselves open to reservations, when they do not appreciate them. 
The food was average and the service was remarkably slow. 
I personally had a very disappointing experience here, which had nothing to do with COVID-19.
I would not recommend this place to anyone."
69,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,6/27/2021,"We had gnocchi with calamari, eggplant parm, broccoli rabe, shrimp arriabata. Everything was divine! The summer Sam Adams brew was refreshing on a hot day. Excellent service."
70,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,12/5/2019,The seafood was so good and their wine selection is also very good for the price. Large portions so you can do it family style . I would definitely come back!
71,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,6/16/2021,The most amazing service provided by Maria!!! The food is authentic - the homemade pasta is unbeatable. Highly recommend their Tiramisu as well. :) Thabks for everything!!!
72,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,8/25/2021,"Horrible flavor.
I grew up in Italy and generally avoid Italian restaurants in the U.S. because I find that they often do not replicate the authentic flavors I'm used to.
I ordered a salad and a special, Risotto Milanese, a favorite of mine.
The salad was a unceremonious mess of iceberg, thick cucumber medallions, cherry tomatoes, pickled onions, and some creamy dressing.
The risotto took 30 minutes to arrive, although risotto tends to have a prep time of 15-20 minutes. Either they were struggling or inefficient in the kitchen. As soon as the dish arrived, I knew it was a disaster. The butter had split from the mixture to form this pool, failing to stay contained within the emulsion. The rice was both overcooked and undercooked, not al dente at all. There were thick slices of Parmesan on top, which do not help with the flavor balance. The risotto was too pale and lacked the appropriate amount of saffron. The dish ended up tasting bland yet thick and greasy.
Service was great though. I let the servers know I wasn't happy and they took the risotto off my bill and offered to make me another dish. I refused, not wanting to waste any food, but I appreciate how gracious they were about the whole thing."
73,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/21/2020,"Absolutely amazing from start to finish!! The waitstaff is so attentive, love the authentic atmosphere, and the food...omg the food!!! The bread was unbelievable on its own, but dipped in the olive oil was even better!!! We had the Arincini  balls as an appetizer. I've never been a big fan of these and now I know why...they weren't made properly!! But Cantina made them so delicious!!! I won't eat them anywhere else ever again!! We had their specialty pasta with sausage and goat cheese. Absolutely awesome and so filling!!! You will NOT leave this place hungry!! We came here on a recommendation and will be back again and again!"
74,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,12/27/2020,Food had no flavor probably the worst Italian meal I have ever had. The service was amazing. I would not recommend eating at this establishment.
75,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,10/31/2021,Fantastic food and even better service.  We were a party of 11 and got to the restaurant 20 min before opening.  They went ahead and seated us and the service was excellent.  Highly recommend the lasagna!
76,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,8/16/2018,"Dined here with 8 colleagues on a Wednesday night during a recent business trip in Boston.  Though noticeably busy, the hostess said she'd seat us ASAP.  After 15 awkward minutes of standing in the narrow entryway, our table was ready.  The dining room walls were plastered with Zagat awards from decades gone by.  I noticed there were none in recent years, then experienced why....

Our server was a nice bald Italian gentleman but was very inefficient.  After sitting unattended for 10 minutes, he came to the table, mentioned restaurant week specials then disappeared for 10 minutes before returning with that menu.  I had a hard time finding anything I was interested in eating, so I went with a salad. 

It took 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive and another 20 minutes for appetizers and bread.  The calamari was sub-par, very greasy and rubbery/tough.  Multiple order errors resulted from him not writing anything down:  2 people ordered the same beer but received 2 different colored brews, still he chose to deliver them.  A salad came out incorrectly and at the wrong time; I chose to just eat so I wouldn't have it reserved to me stale.

Long story short, our entire dining time was over 2.5 hours, not by choice.  Skip this place and try another Italian restaurant in the same 2 block vicinity."
77,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,6/27/2021,"Came here for dinner. It was good that we were able to make a last minute reservation. However, the meal did not meet our expectations. The bread wasn't very good.  I expect better from an Italian restaurant. The Arancini was good, but the temperature was inconsistent. The bolognese was good, but the pasta wasn't cooked enough. The gnocchi was possibly the worst I've had in my life. The sauce was good, but something was wrong with the pasta. The service started out good, but as they got busier throughout the evening we ended up waiting over 20 minutes for the check. I found the ladies room to be a little dirty for my liking."
78,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/22/2019,"This place is so good! While there were lines elsewhere, I was surprised that there wasn't one for this restaurant. Everything was great.

+Food: Be sure to get a dish that has the HOMEMADE pasta. 
-Arugula Salad: So fresh and a great way to wet your palate. Comes with lots of Parmesan cheese
-Bolognese: Ugh so good. I love these classic flavors. I got some cheese shredded on top. Very hearty. Couldn't finish and had a little bit left to bring home.
-Gnocchi: Honestly, some of the best gnocchi I've ever had. It was so soft and not stale tasting or overpowering in any way. I can't remember a time I've had better gnocchi than this. 

+Service:
Super great. Our server checked in a few times and she was so friendly and helpful. We weren't going all out on our meal."

81,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,12/26/2019,"I normally would give Cantina 41/2 stars, but our recent experience was not all our family has been accustomed to over the years. 

It was Christmas Eve and packed house, so was willing to give them a bit of a break. We made a reservation for 8:30 pm and arrived at 8:15. We were there to celebrate my parents' 48th Anniversary. 

It was disappointing that despite our reservation made earlier in the day, we weren't seated until almost 9:20 pm.  

Luckily the kind waitress/bareback/all star put on the BYU/Hawaii football game! 

Also, two groups of 4 people who walked in after is and did not have reservations were actually seated before us! 

I think it was because of the end of the night, but the food just wasn't up to our usual eats at Cantina. I ordered veal Gino, but was served chicken Gino and told it was veal she. I inquired. I decided to take the high road and eat the chicken! 

We also ordered antipasto that never arrived. 

We will come back and I'll post a new review next time.  Hoping it was just an off-night. I did notice the manager Chuck was off duty and the owner didn't seem to be around either. 

I will say the 2 ladies behind the bar did an excellent job entertaining guests while waiting for their tables. 

It was bad the off night cane during our special family celebration, but my parents still had a good time."
82,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,9/28/2021,"Omar our server was such a great person he made my night so excellent, i can't wait to come back i would definitely recommend the food here quality is amazing."
83,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,7/1/2018,"We walked in and didn't think ahead about making reservations. We only waited 15 min but we did eat late to be honest. The host was distinguished and nice. 

We were served quickly and shared meatballs and a pasta dish. Bread and olive oil is served before the meal. We enjoyed the gnocchi tremendously. It was perfectly done! Creamy, tender melt in your mouth awesomeness. 

It was a quick bite. We weren't too hungry and needed to save room for desert. I would have loved to have had a large long meal here. Maybe next time...."
84,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,5/14/2019,"I guess we should have known when we called and sought a last minute reservation on a Saturday night and this was the one place that said they had availability that it was unlikely we'd be seated anywhere near our reservation time, but a wait of an hour is really pretty obscene.  And, the host kept assuring us we were ""easy"" or ""close,"" rather than just being honest or answering us when we checked in repeatedly to ask how many parties were ahead of us or how long of a wait we could expect.  In fact, when we called to make the reservation we were specifically told, ""we're running on time and expect to continue doing so, so please be on time.""  

The waiting area is packed as could be and the bar where you could have a sip and wait is so slow and borderline rude.  It took about 20 minutes to get a beer poured, more for a cocktail, and while you wait, no acknowledgement that your order is next or there's a long backup.  

The food itself was fine, but unremarkable, especially when all the other places on Hanover are pretty much fantastic.  Honestly, nothing justifies the awful service.  It's clear that this place dupes diners by making reservations they can't really accommodate.  It's unconscionable and destroyed our evening.  

Cocktails here are overpriced.  A negroni was $13 and it was overly iced and nothing special.  

The antipasto appetizer special of the day which had several burrata, slices of proscuitto, and grilled artichoke, was the highlight of the meal.  No complaints there.  It was solid.  The meatball appetizer which came with three very large tender meatballs was quite tasty.  The arugula salad was boring but okay, topped with slices of parmesan cheese and a few tomatoes.  The bolognese was okay but the noodles were really stuck together and it could have used a little bit more olive oil and a touch more flavor.  Nothing special."
85,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,4/18/2021,Host is extremely rude. They claimed to have outdoor dining on both the website and opentable but when we got to the restaurant it was indoor only and the hostess was extremely rude on the phone and when we were seated.
86,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,1/25/2020,"This is the first Yelp review I've ever written, which says a lot about this restaurant. With so many Italian restaurants to choose from in the North End, I am so happy we stumbled upon Cantina Italiana.

We started with the Fried Calamari and antipasti -- both were perfect. For entrees, I had the pesto with homemade pasta and my boyfriend had the Fra Diavolo. To finish, we had the tiramisu which was one of the best desserts I've ever consumed. To top it off, our waitress was lovely and attentive.

I 100% recommend this place to anyone in the area!"
87,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/4/2021,Yummmy! Old school Italian that is spot on with food and service. We had barely sat down when the bread basket with nice thick crusty bread. We started with calamari and it was perfect. My husband had lunch he chicken parmigiana plus a side of pasta and I think we could have split it and still had leftovers. My spaghetti and meatballs was awesome. Not a lot of sauce but still delicious. We were tempted by dessert but we were so full we had to pass. I would recommend to anyone.
88,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/22/2021,"My wife and I went here with another couple last Thursday night, 19 Aug.  The food was outstanding. My wife ordered the grilled blackened salmon and she was raving about the flavor. Also, the skin was not cut off as my wife prefers the skin for the omega 3's. The other couple both ordered the veal saltimboca and both said it was excellent. I ordered the chicken piccata and it was delicious. We had fried calamari for an appetizer and it was prepared nicely with hot peppers and a marinara sauce and a lemon wedge. 
The ladies both ordered red sangria and they said it was one of the best with not too much ice. I had a vodka martini and my brother in law had the espresso martini. Both were prepared just right. A complimentary dessert of a cannoli, regular tiramisu and a lemon tiramisu ended our meal. This was unexpected and they were delicious.  Our waitress, Maria was very personable and helped us with our menu choices.  Truly a wonderful experience."
89,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,7/18/2021,"I had the Lasagna and my husband had the Bombolotti Alla Buongustaia, both were excellent!  We were in town for our anniversary, when making reservations I knew it had to be good since they have been open so long."

We enjoyed screaming out random words at the top of our lungs while the football fans cheered on their team. 

As for the food- delicious. We started with the nachos pulled pork- good- could have used some sour cream and salsa- but still good. 

For my main I had their chicken sandwich and fries- delicious! My niece and her bf also enjoyed their meal. 

Drinks are pricey here- but it's Boston so that's to be expected. 

Loved that they checked our vaccine status (I know that's required here- but as a visitor from North Carolina it was new to me- I wish it was required back home) 

Our waitress was friendly and attentive- would definitely return and recommend."

After being unable to get into a nearby bar that we had tickets for we were pleasantly surprised to find a indoor and outdoor seating along with decent size TVs to watch the game. Shortly after we arrived the place filled to standing room only. We had a booth and after initially having to walk and place our orders at the bar the bartenders were great and very attentive. Despite the place being packed they kept the drinks and food coming directly to our table. The food was your standard bar fare but again the service was great"

My husband got wings and i got a chicken sandwish with fries. The young adults loved the fries. My husband and i really enjoyed the sandwish and bun and dipping sause served on side. Sandwich and fries were served hot a big plus for me. I believe premium beers were $6-$8 for 16 oz. We had a new waitress who seemed very dedicated to getting everythg right. She was being trained by a petite blond who was also very pleasant and experienced. Of course the bar area was very loud but the few side booths and upstairs were much quiter. Bathroom was clean too!"
8,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,10/13/2019,"I feel like the restaurant is going through an identity crisis. The WiFi password is ""thebestbbq"", the yelp menu is all about BBQ, but the menu we got today was more sports bar-esque food. If they changed the menu, fine, but a little ""new menu!"" sign would have felt proper.

Service was fine. Our waitress was busy since we came in on a weekend, but she came around every so often. We had to flag her down a couple of times, but had no problem otherwise.

The food experience and price was what made the experience subpar. The kitchen needs to get better at figuring out logistics, because when our food came, my roommate's chicken was steaming hot while my beef was much closer to room temperature.

The fries (with beer cheese and bacon) were delicious and by far my favorite dish of the evening. Was it worth the $10 price tag for fries? Probably not, considering the portions were exactly the same as the side fries that came with my main dish. 

According to my roommate, the southern fried chicken tasted nothing like what you'd expect from ""southern"" fried chicken. It was just fried chicken, with none of the insane crispness that he was used to.

The hanger tips were good, but that's about it. The meat was tender, but somehow not juicy. I personally wouldn't get it again.

Lastly, the draft beer was $7, which is overpriced in my opinion.

All in all, a pretty forgettable place and experience."

10,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,6/12/2018,"My coworkers and I planned on ordering over $200 worth of food and eating in our office (we have a late night ahead of us). Their website let us order (to pay at restaurant) and everything. We scheduled the time for 6PM today and headed over. Upon arriving, we see the restaurant has a sign saying that they're closed until 6/13. What professional establishment would not mention they're closed for a week (6/6-6/13) and not put it anywhere on their website or prevent people from placing online orders? It's a good thing I didn't pay while placing the order because it would have been a giant waste of $200.

Just based on this experience, don't come here and just reading some of the reviews on here, it's not even worth it anyways."

13,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,1/10/2020,"Ordered 12+ meals for a business dinner from Causeway. Attempted to order online and the online system did not work so I resorted to calling in my order. One meal in my order was for someone with a serious Gluten allergy. I made it very clear on the phone with specific directions that I needed a Chicken Caesar Salad with NO CROUTONS and GF Caesar dressing on the side. 

Embarrassing to go to this meeting to find that there is are croutons on this salad. This is the type of allergy where a containment like this is health threatening so to say I was disappointed was an understatement. Had to order an additional salad but made sure to get it from a different restaurant as I couldn't risk another mistake like this. 

All other food was good but overall experience was hindered because of this."
14,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,9/21/2019,"Meh. Short rib is no good. Burned as hell. Corn bread looks like pond scum surgically relocated to a baking pan and baked. Falls apart before it gets to the table. Salad was basically a vehicle for blue cheese, and overwhelming.

Service tip: When someone (sober) spills a drink, you replace it. Your restaurant is making so much money off of drinks. You can replace it. It was a mistake. Don't give the stink eye.

And you should offer to kill the audio to play a watch party's fight song. We were told ""the guy who does the audio isn't here."" It's not rocket science. Make a call. Figure it out.

Their ""smoked wings"" are a joke..smoke wings should fall off the bone and theirs....theirs...I can't explain. Not good! Cornbread...HA! Jiffy's taste better, cornbread should be warm and soft, totally opposite for them...cold and hard. Rice and beans...why did I ever order this because I kinda knew what I was setting my self up for. Let me just say...ONE (1) bite and it remained in the bowl/cup.  Absolutely NOOOOOOOOO flavor, not a pinch of salt...nada...zip...zilch! If I had to give something a positive one star it would be the brisket and that's before cutting all the fat off.

23,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,8/24/2018,"Couldn't believe I walked right by this little gem. I had music playing in a open window I mean very open window this thing is huge. And what a beautiful night for this. I looked at the menu outside  and I was super surprised to find out that this was a BBQ joint & bar. The ambiance is dim lights and a few TV is around. In back is a  shuffleboard  and plenty of open Windows to see the people walking it's near the  TD Garden. We was greeted by a friendly Hostess that sat us  down at a table and she had our waitress come over right away. I ordered the brisket combo with mac and cheese and collars and hubby have the steak tip with rice and mac and cheese. I was hoping the mac was decent ,it was ok, bland but you still get that baked feel. The collards ,whoa ,super vinegar alert ! Not my cup of tea . Cornbread a little dry no butter around ,didn't wanna bother our now scarce waitress . The brisket was perfect. No issues there. Hubby had steak tips medium prolly shouldn't have because they were semi-dried out . Could have used gravy with it . Rice and beans were ok just plopped some beans on the yellow rice.  He didn't touch his Mac after I made ""the face"" he calls it . I was full off my brisket,big portions they give you. Music was on point so made my date night a good one here ! I recommend coming here you would enjoy it ! Just don't look for your waitress much after being seated ,lol . Getting the check is fun too !"
24,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,9/13/2018,"My boyfriend and I got the Tres Combo to share. We picked the brisket, ribs, and sausage along with chips and potato salad. We figured that, because this was a $30 plate of food, it would be enough for 2 people to share. We were very, very wrong.the cornbread was awful and crumbly (we didn't finish it). There was a small handful of chips which were good but it left only about 5 chips per person. One single sausage to split, 2 ribs, and thin slices of steak that were supposed to be brisket I think? None of it was good and it was VERY overpriced. 

We ordered a couple of IPAs off the drink menu but we were shocked that they were $10 each when we got our bill. We get it, Boston prices suck, especially for alcohol. But our total for one small place of mediocre food, 2 well whiskey and cokes, and 3 beers was $75 (without tip)."
25,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,10/1/2019,"I stopped in during lunchtime on a weekday and was greeted by the bartender, who told me to sit wherever. I grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered the cubano. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't very impressed. It was kind of dry, so I had a little difficulty getting through it. The service was good, at least. It was definitely a so-so experience, so I probably won't be racing back."
26,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,3/12/2018,"Causeway Restaurant & Bar is a bi-level sports bar that serves food as well as 20 beers on tap. The restaurant was decorated with sports photos. I wanted to try their drinks (including the Apple Mule, Lemon Ginger Bourbon Fizz, Tropical Sangria, Black and Gold, and Raspberry Lime Spritz). We waited for about fifteen minutes to try and put our drink orders in before we left but the crowd and the claustrophobic space basically drew us away."
27,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,10/22/2019,"Not sure why this is classified as barbecue, but the food was great. We were looking for a spot to have clam chowder and a lobster roll for my co-worker and she loved both. I had a hamburger with side salad. The house champagne vinegarette was amazing. Nice and light. Burger was cooked as requested. Service was good considering there was only one person working the bar and tables. Casual, comfortable atmosphere, and plenty of food."
28,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,4/3/2019,Do not come here if you want to be treated with respect. The bouncer was super disrespectful and would not leave me alone.  He asked for my id even though I kept repeating myself that im only going to order food.  How creepy. Thanks for ruining my experience.
29,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/17/2015,"Had the ribs. They were interesting. You could definitely taste the smoke but the texture of the ribs wasn't what you would expect from some slow smoked ribs. It may also be a result of the fact that the ribs were too big and the seasoning doesn't really get into the meat. 

My preference would be to have smaller ribs and to smoke them until they form a good ""bark"" on the outside and the meat will fall off the bone. 

Anyway, I'd go again for a drink. Just not fit the food."
30,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,8/4/2018,"This place is decent enough, close to the Garden if you're going to an event and very laid back and casual. It's a BBQ menu mostly, although you'd never get that impression by the blasé name, The Causeway Restaurant. Our server was nice, drinks were good, but the food was so-so. I had a chicken quesadilla and it was just okay---the tortilla wrap was very dry and cracker-crusty. I only ate half of it. Maybe I'll pop in again when I'm attending an event at the Garden....maybe I won't. Some of the other menu items sounded good, but then again, so did the quesadilla. We shall see."

32,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,12/8/2018,The bouncer was super rude and yelled at me for standing inside while he was checking my ID..... IS THAT A CRIME thanks bye
33,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,5/18/2018,"Don't go for the atmosphere its not fancy.  Go for the food and lots of it. Our server was great. Try the clam chowder, best we have had. If you like mussels get them here, the portion was huge and delicious. The bacon wrapped scallops were fresh and again delicious. Don't fill up on the bread you won't be able to finish your meal.
We enjoyed dinner so much we came back for lunch. The lobster roll was incredible and a huge portion of fresh lobster. No alcohol is served but you can bring your own.
If you want to eat where the locals eat this is it."
34,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,11/30/2014,"Have been back here 3 times since my first review- was just there last night with my family and had an awesome time. Everyone from the doorman, bartender, to waitress are always friendly and happy to serve.

Standout dishes were the chicken wings (make sure you try Korean!) chips with queso, sunset burger and Mexican Cesar salad. Impressive drink menu with homemade mixers.

Had a great time again- we plan on returning soon! 
Definitely check it out!"
35,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,11/5/2014,"No no no.  Nothing was good about this place.  I work a couple of blocks away and came here with some coworkers for lunch.  Let me list all of the reasons I will never return:

1. Food - this is the most important thing (obviously).  I ordered the spicy sausage with collard greens, fries and a piece of cornbread.  Why these sides?  Because this supposed BBQ place does not serve mashed potatoes or mac and cheese. WHAT?  

- Spicy sausage - the only edible thing on the plate.  I took it out of the too-hard roll.
- Collard greens - ew.  Barely warm and too mushy.  I had 1 bite.
- Fries - tasteless.  How do you mess up fries?  They had no salt.  My coworker next to me bathed her fries in ketchup.  I ate 3.
- Cornbread - hard and dry.  Why is the cornbread at Boston Market better than the cornbread here?  I took 2 bites.
- Drink - diet coke... with no bubbles.  The waitress said it was just their gun.  So why are you serving people sodas when you know it has no bubbles?  I had her take it back and had water.

2. Cleanliness - I opened up my napkin wrap to find a long brown hair.  Since I was with coworkers (and my boss), I didn't make a big deal out of it and just asked for another wrap (about 10 minutes later when the waitress appeared).

3. Service - besides the waitress serving uncarbonated sodas and taking a while to check on us, the thing that annoyed me the most is that she expected us to clear the table for her.  We were seated in a semi-circular booth and my boss was signing the check.  The waitress wordlessly held out her arm for us to give her our plates.  She didn't ask and she didn't wait the 3 minutes for us to leave so that she could clear the table.  I had 3 plates - food plate, bread plate that was already there and my cornbread plate.  She literally held out her hand for each one.  Why?  Just wait until we leave.  Or ask or something.  That was just so strange to me.  I don't want to clear the table for you.  Also, please note that this was a late lunch and there were literally 4 other customers (2 couples).  Its not like there were people waiting for our table and she had to rush.

Anyway - due to the terrible food and annoying service - I have no desire to ever step foot in this place again.  Too bad because it is close to my office.  I'll stick with Beer Works, Tavern in the Square or... pretty much anywhere else."
36,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,11/23/2019,"The woman at the door was very rude and sexually suggestive and made inappropriate gestures with her hands and eyes. She made everyone in our group, male and female, so uncomfortable that we left without refund or explanation. We will not be coming back."
37,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/21/2016,"Overcrowded inside, but no line to get in. $10 entrance fee. Great for a pre or post Bruins / Celtics game hangout. 2 floors which was pretty cool. First floor is more of the sit down at the bar scene, while the upstairs has room to dance and be more social. This place was packed when I went with some friends on a Saturday night. Very casual - jeans and a t-shirt will do. Mixed drinks and liquor were $7 a piece. 

What docks this place the 2 stars was how busy it was and the capacity. We waited about 10 minutes before we got the bartenders attention, and then after we got our drinks, no where to sit or move for that matter. Definitely regretted spending so much to get in and not getting our money's worth."
38,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,9/21/2014,"Wings honey buffalo black pepper - excellent. Smoked and fried. 

Rib tips - doused in honey mustard sauce - whole ribs, literally. Dey exterior but a juicy grey sample meat inside. 

Rib and pulled pork combo. Large spares - nice bark but needed to be finished for longer. Lacking moisture but not bad. Pulled pork was Lacking flavor and Unmemorable. 

Brisket sandwich - rubbery, tough , Unrendered fat. Not much smoke profile. Full slabs of fat all around.

Cucumber salad was fresh but interesting choice adding mustard.

Edamame succotash with crisp beans was excellent. 

Cole slaw was from Sysco, maybe?

A pleasant service but needs some maturity before I'd return."
39,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/20/2018,Been here twice and gotten two very different things. First the nachos which weren't that great and then today the platter of pork with coleslaw and mac and cheese and cornbread. The pork was ok. The coleslaw had no flavor and the Mac and cheese was that Mac and cheese you heat up as a child with some weird seasoning on it. Probably won't be going back for a third try- not worth it. Good music though.
40,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,7/1/2017,"Five stars alone for Laura, she was welcoming and sweet. 
The food however, needs some work. We can discuss later.
Let me write this again, the five stars is for Laura. If she wasn't there. This review would go a complete other way."
41,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,8/23/2017,"Stopped on a Sunday because the sign said Boston's best barbecue, the title is obviously self-proclaimed.

In my experience good barbecue is juicy and tender, Causeway's barbecue is neither of these things and dry & chewy are more accurate depictions. We tried both the pulled chicken and the pulled pork (the former on a sandwich and latter on a salad) and it was pretty much universally bad. We asked for extra dressing just to make the meat more edible and give it some moisture. Barbecue sauce was nothing to write home about, the best comment we can give is on the fries which were edible! We received the bill after a very (VERY) long wait as well, so not too happy with service either (and this was at the bar).  Causeway was overall disappointing and a waste of time & money. We didn't even want the plethora of leftovers because it was that bad."
42,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,11/23/2018,AWEOME staff food and drinks. Drinks are strong and reasonable. Bartenders are friendly and accommodating. Food was awesome I had sliders which were super and only 1.25 on Thursdays.
43,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,12/7/2018,Amazing atmosphere and sweet bartender.. but the bbq burger and beet Greek salad is the bomb.
44,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,8/18/2014,"Oh jeez...what the heck happened...

I've been back twice since the soft opening and it's progressively gone downhill. The first time back, I'd dragged friends along to share my excitement. We ordered two rib platters and 3 brisket sandwiches. The ribs were so tough I ended up with a lot of it left on my plate. My friends' sandwiches remained largely untouched because most of it was bread. We ended up sticking around for drinks, but that also meant dealing with a waitress who was also too busy for us. EVerything took a really long time, and when asked about their alcohol selection, she had to run to the bar for every. single. question.

The second time I came back, I dragged the manfriend because I was afraid I was an unfair judge of bbq. We were told it was a 15 minute wait. Sure. Fine. Great. We waited.

15 minutes became 30 minutes before we were seated. Our food came out fast. I knew better than to get ribs this time so I got a pulled pork sandwich. Manfriend ordered a rib platter and left half of it untouched. It was just too tough and his rack of ribs just so happened to be the ones that were too well cooked...(smoked? bbq'ed? burned???). The sides all tasted like they were mixed in the same too-vinegary sauce. 

We live down the street, but last week when I craved bbq, I just ordered from some placed called L. L. Jay's bbq cafe via diningin. :/ Pity; I really wanted to like this place."
45,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,2/5/2017,"This was almost a 2 star rating!  The atmosphere bumped it up to 3.  I went on a Sunday and the music was loud, the place was crowded, and it was exactly what we wanted.  The food however, was awful!  The wings were big and tasted more like baked chicken.  They weren't like the smoked wings I'm used to but a friend of mine enjoyed the sauce.  The sides were worst.  The macaroni and cheese was not a crowd pleaser neither were the greens.  The red beans and rice were edible but lacked flavor.  Next time, I will probably stick with fries and a drink.  I would return for the vine only!  I will say that you may not be catered to by the host or hostess because no one helps you at the door.  You can however find a server that will help you."
46,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,11/6/2018,"Sad excuse for ""BBQ"". Came in and we ordered a brisket sandwich and a pulled pork quesadilla. Brisket sandwich was cold and flavorless, but our waitress didn't come by once to ask how anything was or to refill drinks. Quesadilla had hardly any cheese, didn't have any onions or cilantro like listed in the menu , and was as thin as two tortillas."
47,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,1/10/2019,Has a good atmosphere and good service especially for the location. Came in on a bruins game and got great service even though it was busy. Food was really good. Just not 5 star worthy in my eyes. You really gotta knock my socks off to get the ol' 5 star from me.
48,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,7/24/2016,"I have to be honest...  This is a great spot for a drink near The Garden / North Station, and the food is OK, but a bit of a disappointment after the glowing recommendation I received from a neighborhood local I met on the train coming home from Maine (shame on me for not checking out the Yelp reviews first).

I'd come back for a beer and an appetizer (it's the food that didn't impress), especially since we only share a couple of appetizers (and a few beers), but I'm skeptical (based on those apps.) . 

On the plus side, the service was great.  They ""checked our luggage"" at the for us, the bartender was great (wish I remembered his name), and the open-air windows were nice.  

If in the neighborhood I'd probably stop back for drinks, and maybe I owe them another shot on the food, but, as I said, I'm skeptical."
49,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,11/15/2014,"I'm split on this review because some of the food was good and some was straight awful. I would highly recommend the Mac and cheese, cornbread, beans, and potato salad. Their BBQ on the other hand was just no. The pulled pork was so dry I actually coughed, and the ribs were straight bones and barely any meat. The wings were somewhere in the middle. Not bad but not the best. Unfortunately, they really dropped the ball on the bbq food. 

Service was great though and everyone was really friendly!"
50,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,6/17/2018,"I made a account just to share how awful this place is. I went there for a night out with friends, and from the moment I entered bouncers and employees were being hostile. We reserved a table weeks in advance but they were ""getting ready"" for an hour..and never got us our bottle.  We had to fight our way upstairs to our reservation and the man at the bar almost took my real id. It's a shame this place is allowed to do business. Save your time and go straight to the Harp next door."
51,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,10/6/2018,Had the burger and is was tasty! Great place to grab a bite before a concert at TD Garden. Friendly staff and fast service
52,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,9/29/2018,Came here with my friends last Saturday night and had the best time! The staff was super friendly and we got free cover charge at the door. Will definitely be back before a game.
53,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,11/18/2019,"I make sure I go to Causeway anytime I'm in Boston! The food is excellent, the service is fast and the servers are polite and go out of their way to take care of their patrons. The bar is amazing with bartenders that actually know how to make drinks properly and they have a great selection of beers. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston Garden! Excellent atmosphere and music, hopefully I can get back to visit soon!"
54,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,11/17/2018,Probably the dumbest bar I've been to. You have an entire upstairs bar full of people for both teams for a football game you said you would show with volume. Multiple people ask to turn the strobe lights off in the upstairs section to watch the game and the response is to instead turn the game volume off and turn on the music full volume like a dance floor. Telling of a bar that not only ignores customers but does the exact opposite of what they ask.
55,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,1/9/2019,Pretty chill place  for Boston had grilled burritovetabke very good to eat relaxed and cool juice box playing very reccimand chill joint

57,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,11/7/2019,"I'be been frequenting Causeway since they have opened! Staff is amazing! New versatile menu (intelligently has evolved for the up and coming area)  is wonderful: pertains to people looking for bar food, people looking for a nice piece of steak/steak tips, or surprisingly vegetarian options! I love making Causeway my go to spot for events at the Garden. Fast food and accommodating service. Food, Drinks, Service won't disappoint, it will become your stable piece of the West End. Check it out!"
58,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,9/1/2018,"Atmosphere is nice, food is very mediocre.
Pro-tip: Chicken wings have been successfully & deliciously prepared without smoking them for over a half a century.  (I'm from Buffalo-you don't smoke wings!) With that, avoid their smoked wings-they are awful-and unfort the only option for wings here.  Other items we ordered-pulled pork BBQ sandwich, quesadilla, salad were fine-but nothing to write home about."
59,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,5/20/2018,"In a word: eh. Ribs and pulled pork were okay. Nothing to write home about for sure. Meat was a day or two old, as was the cornbread. The Mac and cheese was tasteless and the angry corn was much too flavorful. The spice overpowered the corn forcing me to wonder whether I had ordered the corn or just dry salsa. The broccoli and cheese was broccoli for sure but the cheese was so watered down, legally it probably shouldn't be called cheese anymore. Service was meh. She mostly had a smile on her face but was much more interested in chatting with the regulars at the bar.

TL;DR : I wasn't expecting much for BBQ in Boston and was still disappointed."
60,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/30/2016,"The place was pretty nice.. Good food (BBQ steak tips were excellent).  But paid $15 to watch UFC, only to find out (after, of course) they ""can't"" put the TV in front of me on with the fight.  Then the closest TV to me someone stood in front of and they wouldn't ask him to move. 

Good food but, not sure if I'll be back based on that."

63,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,9/28/2019,"Went here to watch the first Pats game of the season this year. Service was fine, but the food on their ""new"" menu is TERRIBLE. I ordered nachos, and they were disgusting. Soggy and breadlike. Not even sure HOW you can mess up nachos so horribly. I immediately called over the bartender and asked to take them away because they were so awful; she didn't even offer to bring out another plate of them, so they clearly knew they were terrible and couldn't make them better. She later brought out wings as an ""apology"" from the cooks, but as a vegetarian this did nothing for me, but my friends enjoyed them. Would go back for drinks, but would NEVER order food from them ever again. When someone else later ordered nachos the bartender literally asked ""are you sure? She ordered them earlier and said they were terrible"", so they definitely know how bad the food is..."

65,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,1/12/2019,"I hate this place so much. Everyone is so mean and they make you wait in line for this ""secret upstairs"". All I know is that Boston should close this place because all the vouchers are so mean to everyone. A drink got poured on me and my friend luke. Everyone boycott this place. It is evil.

66,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,2/6/2018,"On Superbowl Sunday, we decided we wanted ribs.  We looked around the neighborhood and found this just a block away after Googling ""Best Ribs"".  We ordered on-line for pickup at 5:15, just before the game.  We then got a call at 4:00pm asking why we hadn't picked our food yet, and reminded them it was a 5:15 pickup.  We were a little worried they might just keep our food under a heat lamp until then, but said, nahhh, no one would do that! Wrong!  Once we got the food home , we realized that not only did they they do this, and charged us $54.00 for a rack and 1/2 of ribs, we found the food completely inedible.  Heed this review:  DO NOT ORDER TAKEOUT FROM THIS PLACE.  We sent an email with what happened, and guess what?  No response, so they clearly don't have any concern for their customers.  Google, you steered us completely wrong on this one, the ribs were the worst!"
67,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,8/21/2019,"Among the worst meals I have ever had. Potato salad tasted as if it had turned, ""fiery corn"" also tasted ""off."" Pulled pork was just pulled pork with some sauce poured over it. Table did not seem clean. Yuck. Love BBQ, and was looking for a new place to try. Happened to be in the neighborhood so thought I would try it. Never again! The waitress said they were changing their menu at the end of the week and would no longer be doing barbecue. But with that kind of indifference I'm not sure changing the menu will help."

69,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,8/7/2018,"This place was recommended by two people, but it was truly disappointing. The guy who served us was great, but the food was horrible. I ordered the brisket platter. I don't know what it was but it wasn't brisket. It was more like really thin steak that was cooked so well done it felt like I was eating a belt. It was covered with an ok BBQ sauce, which is how I was able to eat it. My beans and rice side had zero flavor unless cardboard is a flavor. My wife said her steak tips we're ok, but wouldn't want to eat there again. There were a few positives, the waiter was great, the angry corn was decent, and they served ice cold pineapple juice. That being said I wouldn't go her again. The only reason I gave it two stars was the waiter."

73,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,1/14/2018,"Fun bar, typical Boston prices, and located in the TD Garden area (a very active nightlife area). There are plenty of TVs if you are interested in watching any sports games while having a drink. Service is nothing to rave about, but is never lacking. Drinks come without any frills, the bartenders just want to serve you and move on to the next customer with speed in mind. Late at night, the upstairs is turned into more of club scene."

75,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/5/2017,For a pub the food is ok. I ordered the brisket. It was cooked well and pretty tender but had lots of fat and gobs of bbq sauce. Fries were ok. Best thing for me was Mac & cheese.

78,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,12/14/2014,"I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars for this place.  It's more like 2.5 stars.  I believe this is a newer place, right across the street from the Garden.  I came here after an early afternoon celtics game with my dad.  

Red flag #1 was the fact that this place was empty and people were bypassing it for a more crowded Harp.  That was a harbinger of things to come.  

First impressions was this place was a BBQ joint, though the menu had some odd items on it.  I went with the Cubano, which was average at best.  The problem was the sides.  Cranberry mashed potatoes?  Really strange tasting.  The baked beans were a disgrace to any BBQ place.  Watery and definitely undercooked.  My dad seemed to enjoy his chicken salad sandwich and clam chowder (with cornbread and olive oil.  Wtf?).  I'm not sure what the chef is really thinking with some of these combinations.

To make it worse, our server was slow despite having literally no one else to serve.  She even forgot what my dad ordered.  Twice.  

I probably will avoid this place in the future for food after a game."
79,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,9/16/2015,"Food was Superb  make sure you take advantage of the newly added ""Fried Mac n Cheese balls"" for an appetizer and the ""Chicken Quesadilla"" which was fresh well seasoned and crispy. Great job Chef Jeshua 

The service was 100% on point! The bartender poured and had ready a glass of water with a lemon on side and placed in front of me within a minute of sitting at the bar and proceeded to be very attentive and hospitable. Make sure to ask for Dave and say ""HI"" he is the man!

The overall atmosphere was great from the friendly staff, music and decoration/setup definitely a place you need to experience! 

Thank you Tim for a great time!"
80,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,11/4/2017,I would give no star if I could. Waited half an hour in line to get into Causeway and waited another hour to get upstairs to the club? Saw groups of people skip the line and get into the elevator to go up to the same club. Won't be back.
81,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,2/2/2015,"This review is long overdue.. I went to the Causeway when I was home just before Christmas.  The service was excellent, as were the wings.  It is extremely hard to find a restaurant in Boston that actually knows how to make Barbecue, and this place has NAILED IT!!

I went there with a fairly big party and we got plenty of items off of the menu.  Wings were unreal, wing tips were also a great appetizer.

I then got the brisket which was extremely tender and cooked just as if I was eating it down in the south at a BBQ joint.

I ended up staying there pretty late into the night and the place filled up with a great crowd of people.  Bartenders were very cool and mixed up some great drinks.  

Overall, I will def be back to this place the next time I am in Boston."

We had quick service at the bar and then proceeded to wait in another line for the upstairs ""club"" scene. Once inside, the music was really good- great mix of popular hits and throwbacks. The only down side was the lack of mats to prevent the floors and stairs from being so slippery from spilt drinks."

I went with a group of friends on Friday night because the line was short to get in, and paid $10 for cover. We got inside and got drinks only to realize that the real line to get into the dance area was inside, after you already paid cover. Sleazy move. Waited 50 MINUTES in line inside and still were not in the dance area. We asked for a refund on our cover charge since we just waited in line for an hour and were thenkicked out of the bar aggressively and swore at by the manager. Will never return and will tell everyone I know that this place is definitely not worth it especially given the other great options in the area."
84,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,3/14/2019,"Such a terrific spot in the heart of the sports world in downtown Boston! The service and friendly staff were only a part of our enjoyable evening. The food and bar service were excellent - they have a bacon cheeseburger w bbq sauce that is heaven!! Their apps are so yummy esp the truly exotic cheese plate, the shrimp, and the pub chips. Sam the bartender (shouldn't every bar in Boston have a Sam?) is great, with super suggestions for spirits suggestions. The chef came and visited with us which really topped off our night. Looking forward to our next visit FOR SURE!"
85,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,5/16/2018,"My husband and I stopped here to grab a quick meal before the celtics game. It seemed pretty busy when we walked in, but we were seated upstairs shortly. It was loud but what do you expect from a crowded restaurant. Our food came quickly and correct. Everything was so good and exactly what I wanted. We left feeling full and happy."
86,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,9/13/2015,"If you're going for drinks, especially beer, you're at the right place. They have a great list of beers on draft and have security which is a plus. The staff is really friendly and they serve you pretty fast. 

The kitchen closes at 10 on Sundays, which was a bummer. My friend had to order for me while I was on my way. 

It's not in the prettiest area but it works overall. Try not to walk over there at night if you're more than 10 minutes away. Not very safe. (Man or woman) 

This place is a nice and organized bar. I wouldn't consider it a restaurant per se although I must say that the food is great and affordable. Had a burrito on a plate and my friend had a pulled pork sandwich with beans and cole slaw. His portion was abundant."
87,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,1/19/2015,"Great barbecue! They have a legit smoker and you can tell. We have never had a bad meal here and they have a variety if beer. Its a hidden gem before any game at the garden. 

The quesadilla's are my favorite and the corn bread is spot on. The food is served quickly but with enough time to enjoy yourself. Baked beans were spot on, and the Cesar salad was vert different. They even give you complimentary home made bbq sauces in glass bottles. Nice touch. I highly suggest this new spot!"
88,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,8/17/2017,"We came here for a Riddim+Blues event. It was an R&B brunch. They played mostly 90's r&b (my all time favorite genre) and my wife and I both had chicken and waffles. Pretty good food, definitely tried to skimp on the syrup though but when we asked there was more. I had a drink called Bonita applebaum. OMG so good. Rumchata, some kind of apple liquor and caramel. If I was driving I would have had 648e76287464783 of those."
89,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,4/27/2019,"This bar has great bartenders and DJs, but the bouncers/security let any drunk person, who is falling on the floor, stay in the bar. There is unreliable security and the upstairs floor feels like it is going to fall in when people are dancing. Also, definitely don't wear nice shoes to this bar!!!"
0,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,12/6/2020,"LOVED their coffee but honestly thought there wasn't enough care put into the bagel. During my review (full video below) I said the taste was there but it was soft and not warm enough. Turns out their bagels are from Iggy's which I know has good bagels.

1,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,3/25/2022,"Of the clutch of coffee shops and cafes in Charlestown MA, incredibly, just this one - Zume's - no longer allows customers to use their bathroom, even in an emergency and after paying for items.  

So if you order at Zume's and gotta go, no luck ""because it's Covid""!? This is the end of March 2022 when Zume's management no longer requires masks. But they keep the bathroom locked behind a hanging curtain?! 

So best advice is go forth to Tatte, Starbuck's, Sorelle's, Style, and other local coffee shops that respect customers enough to maintain an accessible, clean restroom post-Covid."
2,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,7/10/2021,"My morning tradition. Good coffee, pastries, and people. Love the recent remodel and looking forward to spending some time in the window seats watching Charlestown walk by."
3,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,2/19/2020,"So I have been living in Charlestown since September, but today was my first time to Zume's. I normally make my coffee at home but I'm out of almond milk and thought I'd stop here on my way to work. 

I brought in my Yeti cup figuring that maybe they offer a lower price for bringing your own cup (come one people, let's save Earth one cup at a time). Nope I was in fact charged for a large when I'm sure my 20 oz Yeti is most likely smaller than their large. No almond milk on the counter and I was in a rush so I didn't want to wait back in line to ask for some. Oh well. ""Large"" drip coffee medium roast and yogurt parfait for a whopping $7.38

This is not what bothered me about this visit. I get to work, have a couple morning meetings and finally sit down at my desk to enjoy my parfait. I open it up to find black hairs in the parfait. I would normally be ok and just say let's pull that hair out and carry on, but the more I dig around the more hairs I found. Absolutely foul. This is unforgivable in my mind. I would hope the employees making these parfaits would be wearing a hair net, but clearly not. 

I would love for a manager to reach out to me to resolve this matter. This is appalling for any food industry service. Yuck."

6,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,6/20/2019,"COFFEE.
real COFFEE.
COFFEE with testicular fortitude even.
Tasted like coffee, not a warm brown undistinguished beverage.
Take a BOW, Zume's.

We dropped in just before closing time after a big walk / climb and exploring Bunker Hill Monument and museum in Charleston Ma.

Service issues alleged by other reviewers were a non event in our experience. Greeted warmly. Served promptly. WiFi worked, no passwords = no problemo.

Savoury quiche was passable nothing special.
Passing grade (barely) in the cleanliness department,
Soundtrack not in my sweet spot, a tad whiny, but hey......

A comfortable oasis on a day when our 1st choice in Charleston for lunch stopped serving at 3 pm and we didn't fancy 'bar snacks'.... and we kept walking.... 

was ZUME'S.

Mom n pop shop NOT a mean big green logo originating in Seattle = a plus.

Solid 4 star coffee house.

7,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,11/27/2020,"The breakfast sandwich on the English muffin is great. The service is terrible. The owner, I assume, has been snippy with me every time I've ever been in the shop. I've lived in Charlestown for seven years, and literally only bother going to this shop when I want an excellent sandwich with a side of straight up rude."
8,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,10/9/2020,Love that they have oat milk! Makes it an easy yes when suggested. My only suggestion for them would be to have more vegan options. A vegan cookie would have gone great with my London fog!
9,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/29/2020,"Great coffee (strong but not harsh) and yummy baked goods. I mean, look at this guy! Super nice people. Will definitely keep visiting."
10,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,6/5/2021,I love Zume's. The staff is friendly and the coffee and baked goods are just plain delicious. This is the perfect neighborhood coffee house and one of my favorite parts of living in Charlestown.
11,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,8/18/2019,"Honestly though,
I'm all for supporting local. I walked by this place alot and it was always closed. I finally was around when open so i gave it a try. Man did I soon regret that.  looked at the menu for a bit, then once decided was still ignored,for a few mins. They finally notice me and I order. Got a hot salted caramel latte, even tho I ordered oded. Didn't say anything because i figured maybe I didbt say iced eveb tho I'm almost positive i did. Then I get the cup, its barely halfway full, AND its like salt water. So NASTY. Honestly, ill just stick to the Starbucks 2 more minutes down the road."
12,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,9/5/2020,"The best coffee and community in Boston!

So stoked they have added vegan options to the menu. 

The chickpea wrap is amazing!! A must visit when in Charlestown, great location right on Main Street."
13,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/1/2019,Zume's had a friendly atmosphere and a lot of choices for breakfast. I got the egg and cheese sandwich on an English muffin (the best English muffin I've had in a long time).
14,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,11/1/2019,"Left and went to Starbucks. No power outlets, WiFi was terrible in that it kicked you off every 15 minutes. Friendly staff, ok coffee, not a place to hang out. I was going to stay for a while and get more to Eat and drink, but I had to leave because I needed a power outlet. Starbucks it is."

The food was good. Got the sausage breakfast sandwich on a croissant.
The coffee was good too. Gotta iced mocha with an extra shot.
The red chairs were sooooo cozy.
The vibe was super chill.
Coming again during my visit here."
17,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,10/23/2019,"Went here for the first time this morning - I might be a regular customer from now on! Very friendly service, a great tasting americano (not acidic at all) and a very fluffy glazed donut. All in all a great experience."
18,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,1/15/2019,"I have been coming to Zumes for years as I love to support local businesses, but after a few recent visits that were below average I will now be finding a new coffee shop. Their iced coffee is one of my favorites, but that does not outweigh the poor (and often rude) service that I have received during my recent visits. There are not many things that can turn me off of a place I once loved, but rude service is just not appreciated, nor is it appropriate."
19,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,10/23/2017,"I sat here for about an hour or so to do some work, and I also ordered an iced chai tea latte, which was good, but this review is mostly about the service! I forgot my wallet, and didn't realize until about an hour later, after Zume's had closed! However, one of the baristas answered immediately, and when I mentioned the wallet, she said she'd put it in their safe after checking to see if there was any contact info inside. They were still closing, so she said I could come by and get it if I could be there in the next few minutes. Overall, she went above and beyond to help me, and I'm super grateful!"
20,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,5/1/2018,"Zumes has been a Charlestown staple for some time now.  The coffee and food appeals to a wide selection of tastes.

I love the display of local art (which is updated regularly).

The service at Zumes is friendly, well organized and efficient.

There is always a hustle and bustle adding to the friendly vibe.

I personally prefer supporting local business owners."
21,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,5/23/2018,"When Zume's first reopened, I was not impressed. But 5 years later (and 1 ""no strollers inside"" policy) my opinion of this place has really changed. I've seen a conscious effort from management over the last few years to be more welcoming and hire more friendly staff. They've also rolled out several new food options including a larger variety of pastries and quick to-go lunch options like burritos and sandwiches. 

I think this place has finally become what Charlestown needed - a great little neighborhood coffee shop for the locals. Here's hoping that people continue to come here and support Zume's in spite of the new Starbucks down the block."
22,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,9/13/2015,"Love that this shop is so near my home, though that has no bearing on my review.

The interior is a cozy mix of industrial coffee house - sort of an ideal presentation in 2015. That interior alone is nothing to write home about, though the original wall art is always a welcome display. (I just wish I could afford some of it!)

The stars of this place is the food and coffee - just what you'd hope for at a ""coffee"" shop.

I got an Americano and added a touch of cream and sugar. (I prefer it con panna, but I realize not all coffee shops have whipped cream. No worries, it was still a great tasting espresso.)

Baked goods are always hit or miss to me. Sometimes they taste old, and you're sad you even gave them a shot. Not these! The quiche are made, then frozen, then thawed for display - still relatively fresh. My bacon and swiss quiche could have easily been fresh. After heating, the crust was a bit dry and softened under the reheating, but the lovely inside bits made it all come together nicely. It's so easy to ruin a quiche when runny eggs or too much of any one ingredient. These tiny pockets were harmoniously made.

Then I got the key lime tart. My hopes of saving it for later were a failure. That flamed marshmallow topper and golden graham crust were too luscious to ignore after my quiche. My remaining espresso needed a partner with whom to go down gracefully. Wow! Crusts on deserts are my favorite part. Faintly buttery, crispy but soft, and just a little sweet. The filling was everything you'd hope for from a quality pasty - not the lime green stuff you find in a sad, pre-packaged box. The marshmallow topping hid that glorious secret (normal colored filling!) all-too-well. Sorry, tart, I just couldn't save it for later. 

Which is ok, since I hope to be a regular at this place.

And, lest I forget, the staff were friendly and helpful. Nice crew."
23,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,2/28/2019,"Great little coffee shop with friendly service and good snacks. Coffee is full of great flavor, molasses cookies are incredible and the service is friendly. They have good little seating areas with local art on the wall. Nice place to spend some time."
24,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,1/13/2019,Coffee is okay. Sometimes it tastes burnt. Ordered a breakfast sandwiches that was really tough to eat. The bagel was definitely not fresh.
25,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/27/2019,"Been living in Charlestown for 30+ years and this place is legit. If you have kids, it's perfect. The nitro coffee is amazing and all the food is delicious. All the ""poor service"" reviews are BS. Support local business!  Can't miss."
26,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,4/25/2019,"You'd be hard-pressed to find a better breakfast sandwich with an english muffin. I got the sausage egg and cheese and it was a total knockout. It's essentially a Portuguese EM, fluffy and moist. Incredible."
27,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,4/23/2018,"The 5 stars is for their version of an English Muffin . More often than not I have to use a condiment on breakfast sandwiches due to the bread being so dry . I have now gotten the sausage breakfast sandwich three days in a row and each day it has been consistent . I'm a simple coffee girl . I just like black iced and they provide that at a decent price and not tasting burnt . I just moved in around the corner so I will pick this over Starbucks , only minus is it's very limited seating and it's usually full"
28,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,8/29/2018,"I really want to like this place but I can't. 

On multiple occasions I have been treated rudely by staff. The least of which has been eye rolls when ordering as I am not completely familiar with the menu. The worst is when I asked for a ""regular"" coffee as many small coffee shops have a regular and large size and getting rudely asked ""well, what is a regular?"" The staff here could save a lot of time and energy if they weren't so rude. 

Another problem I have is their hours. If they were open later I'm sure they would have more customers. I would rather support a local business like Zume's but if they make it difficult for me I can just use my drip coffee machine at home."
29,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,11/8/2018,"My girlfriend and I were staying in Charlestown and this cool little place was right down the street.  The staff is great! We had some cool conversation waiting for my coffees.  The Incredible Hulk singing ""Thriller"" on Halloween made my day!"
30,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,6/25/2018,"I really can't wait until cafe Nero comes to Charlestown and runs this place out of town! I have been there 3 times since it is right down the street from where I live and the 3rd trip will be my last.  So, the first time I went to Zume's I wanted a cold brew which they did not have, even though every coffee shop in the city including Dunkin Donuts now has cold brew. The second time I slept in on a weekend day and was craving a breakfast sandwich- well this is the only coffee shop I've ever heard of that does not serve breakfast past a certain time( like after 10:30 or 11am). I decided to go back because i was excited to hear that They finally served cold brew. So I went in and ordered a medium- $6.26.  I honestly thought she was kidding. Needless to say, I will not be back . It's too bad because it is a great space in a great location!"
31,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,12/19/2019,I wanted to try this place for a while and it didnt disappoint! The coffee was delicious and fresh. I got a breakfast sandwich and it was great. I highly recommend Zume's!
32,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/8/2018,"Just Okay

We wanted a cup of coffee and a few minutes to relax, so we popped in here.  While there was certainly wrong with anything (except the wi-fi), there was also certainly nothing memorable the place.  The service was adequate, the coffee was decent, the seating was comfortable, and the wi-fi didn't work."
33,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/10/2018,Stop by today for lunch. Clean quiet atmosphere in this coffee house. Staff was very helpful and ready to take my order. I purchased a lemonade and black iced tea. It was awesome! The cranberry and chicken salad was also awesome except for the small bone that pierced my tongue.
34,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,8/8/2016,"Good coffee and the pastries are amazing really tasty and fresh not super sweet I think they have the right amount of everything, the staff is always nice and patient if you are trying to decide what to order, the vibe in the place is chill and it welcomes you to stay and relax I recommend it if you are around !"

37,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/23/2016,"Zume's is the best.  Coffee is consistent and good.  Customer service is great.  I highly recommend their baked goods and menu items.  I enjoy the egg and cheese bagel- without cheese, add ham and extra egg.  It's under $5, what a deal.

The chocolate chip cookie is like crack.  Sometimes I wish I had never tried a chocolate chip cookie from Zume's.  But I did, and now when I want to treat myself I get them.  They are huge, about 3-4 times the size of a normal cookie.  I like to enjoy 2 at a time.  Soft chewy center, large chunks of chocolate, and they are huge."
38,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,4/25/2014,"This is just what Charlestown was lacking; a laid back place to sip your latte and read or chat with some friends. Aside from the delicious coffee, this place is aesthetically pleasing with it's modern industrial feel. The artwork adds character and shows the connection to the community.

As an animal lover, it is great to see everyone gather with their pups outside, as Zume's shows their 4 legged friend support! All and all,  I am a lover of independent coffee shops and this place does meet everything I like in them. 

The only thing I wish is that they were open later at night. But being in Charlestown, the foot traffic may not be worth the extended hours! 

Keep it up guys!"
39,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,6/9/2015,"This is a cool little neighborhood place, where the look, right down to the pastry cases, definitely is equipped like McBucks, but that is where the comparison stops. They have fantastic baked goods, and a sizeable hot breakfast and sandwich array that comes out of a kitchen, not a Star-Trek-Meets-Suzy Homemaker convection warmer.  The coffee?  Very very good.  The only reason I drop it a star is because they have a ton of people working there, but when the coffee bar is slammed, and it's slammed, management only has one barista on? The place is packed as it's one of the few good breakfasteries around, so tell Scrooge McDuck to come up with a touch more cash for another pair of hands on the bar, please."
40,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,9/15/2017,"Had a very negative experience at Zume's. Went in for a coffee and food with friends midday after stroller bootcamp at the monument. We had two strollers between the four of us for our 3 month old babies. 

After ordering we were told that the stroller situation has been a bit of a problem there. They have implemented a no stroller policy recently and next time we cannot bring our strollers in.  We drank our coffee and before we were heading out another employee told us that we had to go outside and we cannot stay with our strollers and there is even a sign on the door. I informed both of the women that this was discrimination and we will not be returning.

How is this right? There was plenty of room for other customers to get by. Who will they discriminate against next? 

We live in the city... would they be paying for a replacement stroller if it were to be stolen out front? How can they expect a mother with young children to get her kids and belongings out of the stroller and come in and order...that is not feasible. 

I am all for supporting small local businesses but not when they mistreat their customers. Good luck with Starbucks coming in right down the street. I am sure they would be happy to have the business of mothers with children."
41,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,1/30/2019,"They intentionally have no outlets, which as someone who works remotely defeats the purpose of a coffee shop. I totally understand not wanting people to take advantage, but having no outlets seems excessive and petty. Food is fine"
42,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,6/17/2019,Love the interior and the cozy cafe feel. I typically order a medium iced coffee and it is very good. The sandwiches are made to order and made with fresh ingredients. It's one of my favorite places in the Charlestown area.
43,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,4/26/2015,"Turkey wrap is awesome. Convenience of getting said turkey warp is not. My first visit, I attempted to order at 11:56 and was informed the kitchen doesn't open till 12. So I stood aside for 4 minutes so that I could get back in line to order. Second time I got there a few minutes before 3. Waited in line. When it was my turn to order, they said the kitchen closed at 3.

I would eat here again, but I will never go out of my way to do so. If I was starving between 1215 and 245 and happen to find self directly in front of zumes and it was too inconvenient to go somewhere else maybe I'd give them another shot. 

I have also tried the iced coffee. It's not really anything special."
44,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,12/16/2015,"I love this spot whenever I'm in the area and looking for a quick bite I like to stop by and grab the avocado turkey sandwich it's so delicious. I haven't tried their coffee but their chai lattes are really good as well if you are looking for an alternative. The staff is super friendly and loves answering questions you might have. 

This spot is quiet for reading and has comfortable lounge chairs, the only drawback is that they don't have outlets so if you are looking to get some work done on your laptop it's a great spot until your battery runs out of charge."
45,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,9/8/2018,"Love the products great coffee and breakfast sandwiches but super disappointed in the service. I asked for a shot of espresso over ice in a large cup. I'm pregnant so I nurse my coffee/caffeine all day and need to have sufficient water/ice with it to stay hydrated. They pulled a small cup so I said no bigger -- they gave me a medium and then tried to charge almost $5 for a latte!  I said the price/product was wrong when it rang up and long story short they charge by the cup size regardless of what's in it. They were completely inflexible with the policy, despite my pregnancy and urging, they would not budge nor would they explain the rationale behind the policy. I hate to write a bad review - blame it on the hormones - but this was very disappointing to me."
46,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,8/19/2018,"Unfortunately, I think this place is very over-priced. A large cold brew is 8.51 -- they told me it's priced so high because it's George Howell brand...however I went past the George Howell booth at Boston Public Market and a large cold brew is only 5.00."
47,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,8/23/2018,"I am a pregnant woman who has lived in the Boston area for years. I went into this coffee shop to support a local business, rather than going to Starbucks down the street. I ordered an ice coffee and sat at the counter and ate a chia seed pudding that I had purchased at a local juicery. Despite having bought a coffee, the owner kicked me out for having brought ""outside food."" Horrible experience, I will never be back and will not recommend anyone else to come here in the future."
48,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,1/11/2018,"I've been to Zume's many times and each time I go in I am always blown away. All the staff is polite. They have great non-lactose milk options for coffee. But, the best part has to be their breakfast sandwiches; specially their 'english muffin"". It's soft, dense and buttery, almost like a biscuit. My go-to sandwich is the sausage, egg and cheese on the english muffin. It won't disappoint!"
49,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/28/2017,I love Zume's!!!  I have been going there since they opened. The coffee is more expensive than Dunkin Donuts however the quality of the beverages and food as well as atmosphere make it something I like doing for me and my

51,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,12/15/2016,Tried this place today instead of my regular Dunkin' Donuts and was pleasantly surprised. Really good coffee and quick service.
52,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,1/3/2015,"Great hot chocolate! I come all the way from Roxbury just for it. This is one of those rare coffee houses where the employees know your name and your order as soon as you step up to the counter. Fyi, don't go during the day on weekdays looking for a seat, all the moms with their babies crowd the place. I almost got taken out by a stroller once. Get your drinks and go, unless its in the evening by then all housewives are home making dinner lol"
53,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/15/2015,"Things I love at Zumes: the cookies (the best in Boston!!), the breakfast sandwich on English muffin, the baked goods (great muffins), and of course the coffee.  

But I wish they had more sandwich options.  They used to have heated ones but stopped.  Those should come back (especially in the winter months).  And I wish you could get smaller sized smoothies (the one size is just too big)."
54,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,9/30/2016,Coffee was solid and the baked good options looked decent but not overly tempting. Good for a quick drop-in.
55,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,10/23/2018,"Love that it's a 10 minute walk from my office. Coffee and chai tea latte has always been consistent. I've had their breakfast sandwiches and they're pretty standard. Staff can be a hit or miss, but don't let that turn you off. Just sip sip away!"
56,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,11/22/2017,"Espresso drinks are weak, service poor. After various purchases and complementing the owner/manger on the decor, I was treated rudely by her for a humble request (certainly no customer first attitude shown)."
57,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,10/30/2013,Wish they started serving lunch earlier for the working people. It can't be that hard. When the place is busy it is hard to hear them call your name. Food was good.
58,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,2/4/2018,"First of all, I support small businesses and want to see them thrive but Zume's customer service has been so variable - sometimes they are ok but more often then not (lately) they have been unwelcoming/rude- it def needs improvement ( esp now that Starbucks is open). As far as food items go, Some items are great (English muffin sandwiches, ice coffee) but some things are incredibly overpriced (iced cold brew). If you want to keep customers, improve your customer service!"
59,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,12/13/2017,"Great, warm coffee shop! Downfall is they don't don't have Apple Pay, outlets for a phone or computer charge and don't take Amex. I spend at the very minimum $50 a week for coffee and lunch while I try to do some casual computer work before or after work. Unfortunately they lose out on me as a customer and many more who are looking for the same. I wish they would add these amenities to stay in the game now that Starbucks is here..."
60,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,3/11/2017,"Solid and consistent coffee and food at every visit. I wish they had more seating, granted I go at peak times. My favorite are the Latte's, always on point and keep me going for the entire day."
61,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,8/27/2018,"I came here for a quick grab and go breakfast and gotta say they've got ONE OF THE BEST ICE COFFEE around!  I'm picky with iced coffee since I like it black and no sugar/added flavors, but this ice coffee has some good fragrances and taste making it so refreshing to have!  I would come here again just for the ice coffee.  And also the blueberry coffee cake :)"
62,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,4/12/2014,"I've been here a few times and have enjoyed their (excellent) desserts, (excellent) drinks - tea and coffee all seem creative enough and tasty, and (excellent) sandwiches.
This place is typical for a good local coffee house, nothing crazy. But it's cozy, I've always enjoyed my experiences, the staff, and the food has always made me happy."
63,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,9/4/2016,"Just discovered this place.   Very friendly vibe, comfortable armchairs, fast service, good latte, amazing looking food.   Wish I hadn't already had brunch.  I'll be back next week."
64,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,4/30/2016,"Great place for a coffee to go, reading a book or doing some work. They take credit card, have bar stools and comfy red reading chairs, and have yummy pastries."
65,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,6/24/2014,"Zume's always seems to make my day a little better. 
The staff is always nice, which you might think is standard, but it's really not in most places. It's a feel good local charlestown place and I always head over after Yoga. 

If you are looking for French Vanilla, ask for Hazelnut and Vanilla flavors."
66,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,2/12/2015,"Visiting the area, we decided to have lunch here. We got the chai latte and Hunky Monkey protein smoothie along with a turkey avocado ciabatta panini. Everything is DELICIOUS!!! I love the artsy/industrial design of the place, and everything on the menu is healthy. We will probably be coming back during our visit."
67,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,9/18/2014,"Zume's makes the best latte in the city. I don't know what their secret is but they are amazing.

I was hesitant to go after reading a few reviews about the service but I have never had a bad experience. 

The pastries are made in house and are fantastic. You have to try a cinnamon snail!"
68,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,5/25/2017,"As much hype as people give this place, I just don't see it! Ive been in a handful of times and have found that the coffee is very bland & watery, and that some of the staff (manager) is just very unfriendly. Hoping to have a more pleasant experience in the future"
69,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,2/11/2016,"No wall outlets. But friendly staff. Decent coffee, decent food. The inside is pretty cozy, and every time I've been, there's plenty of seating. It's a very typical coffee shop feel to it. It's a hard choice between 3 and 4 stars for me, but it's not much out of the ordinary. I wouldn't tell someone not to go, especially if you're looking for a nice little spot in Charlestown."
70,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,12/24/2013,"I love this place! I've seen a few Boston celebs in here so it must be good!  The coffee is always good and they have a great bakery display of yumminess. I personally enjoy the chocolate chunk cookie; definitely something to share. 

They only serve breakfast until 12 on weekends so you late risers should get there before noon. The egg sandwich is simple and delicious. 

Definitely try them out if you're in the area!"
71,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/15/2013,"This is a sold three star joint!  

I live within walking distance of Zume's and I have found that I prefer their lunch options over Sorelle.  While Sorelle may boast a larger sandwich menu, I find that the choices I've made in the sandwich category have been quite good.  Three standouts for me have been the Cuban, the Turkey and Avocado, and Chicken and Goat Cheese.  For breakfast, I am partial to the egg sandwich & the salmon & lox on a bagel.  Breakfast options can be a bit steep in price, though I find that I am full for a long period of time.  

I don't tend to like strong coffee, so when I do get coffee it does tend to be iced coffee in the summer.  In addition, I am partial to the Crimson Berry Iced Tea.  That is a fave of mine.  

Generally I get my stuff and leave.  As others have stated, many people do tend to camp out (perhaps due to the free wi-fi) and there is limited seating.  Since the remodel was done, I feel like there is even less seating.  While on the subject of the remodel, I feel like it became more industrial and austere in terms of the atmosphere.  The remodel did strip the place of some of its character, in addition it feels like the public space is smaller.  While I am sure that the work environment may be better for staff, for me that was a recognizable difference.  Though, all this doesn't bug me too much as I am a ""to-go"" girl.  

I do give the place props for showcasing local artists.  There's always new artists exhibiting their art, and you can't help but to check out the walls each time you come in."
72,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/25/2016,"I preface this with the fact that historically, i am a dunks guy so i've been told my coffee pallet is not to be trusted.  Sooo the goods...Staff is familiar and awesome!  The croissants are a small piece of a French heaven.  The Zumes light roast isn't weak but its grown on me and now I am starting to prefer a slightly stronger brew. (refer back to preface)  Idk if thats good or bad but its now my coffee of choice.  Finally, I enjoy all their food.  Obviously its a coffee shop and should be graded more heavely on the coffee but again, i dont have a coffee palett so for me to critique on that aspect would be remiss, but I couldnt see it not being delicious as the the americanos seem to fly out the door."
73,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,11/22/2013,"Had to try the English muffin and didn't regret it at all! The coffee was great too but I'm still addicted to DD. 

The layout of the chairs was a little odd to me... It's mostly sofas that line the walls with a small table next to each one, like I was waiting to get a foot massage. 

Worth a try!"
74,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,7/24/2014,There menu for lunch beds to be bigger and more kid friendly.but in the nice side there smoothies are delicious and very healthy .If I had known I would have definitely just gotten the smoothie.I suggest the protein blast
75,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,3/22/2013,"Came here to say I love Zume's as my local coffee shop. Nice strong coffee and their 10lb cookies are amazing! I strongly recommend you try them. 

I'm only giving 3 strars through as there are often a lot of ""campers"" who sit all morning. With minimal seating, this can be frustrating for people who do want to eat. I will say that I'm not sure there's much they can do about this though as I would assume asking people to leave is the worse of two evils.

The Roasted Vegetable Sandwich was pretty slimey too. Go with the Caprese!

Lastly, I think the renovations look great."
76,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,4/6/2014,"I love this place; not just because it's a 3 min walk from my condo, but because they have a great atmosphere, great product & awesome staff.
It's always packed I wish they stayed open later."
77,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/3/2016,"It's a really cool atmosphere but the coffee is just OK. Much prefer the actual coffee from Wholefoods across the street.  
One thing I do like are the breakfast sandwiches."
78,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,11/17/2014,"I've finally decided to bite the bullet and write a review. I've ventured to Zumes about 4 times over the last two months. Each time I have had the older lady or the older man which I expect are the owners of the establishment.  I have been less than pleased with their service.  They seem to be quick to judge and always huff and puff while they are working.  My latte was warm and was only filled about 3/4 of the way and the rest was foam. Sorry, but every latte I have ever had it was roughly 1/2"" to 3/4"" of the top filled and the rest foam. I told them to fill it up and they said, ""That is how we make them here."" I said, ""Well that's not how a latte is supposed to be. Can you please fill it up?"" And they grumbled. People are right. They appear like they are doing a favor to their customers.  We are paying YOU for a product, not for your attitude. 

The only reason this coffee place is still open is because of the local community's love for small businesses.  If it were not for the Charlestown crowd this place would have closed down long ago."
79,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,8/16/2015,"Excellent coffee here, some of the best I've had in the city of Boston. The only thing holding it back is that the breakfast sandwich was good, but not great. That being said, I love the coffee so I'll be there as much as possible."
80,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,2/29/2016,"The place where they know your name, and coffee order. 

There's something to be said for walking into a joint where the staff know who you are, and what you want. This place is filled with very friendly and welcoming neighborhood people. The coffee is much better than the Dunk's across the street, and at a similar price point as Starbucks. 

I've tried a number of the breakfast and lunch sandwiches, but my go to order when I'm feeling indulgent is the bagel and lox. Open faced bagel and lox sandwich with capers, red onion, and tomato.

The muffins are spot on as well if you're looking for something a little less than an entire sandwich.

One thing I've noticed is that special orders sometimes get mishandled more times than they should, but mistakes happen, and the staff is always more than happy to rectify the order."
81,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,7/8/2012,"Zume's is a great coffeehouse! My friends and I rented a house nearby for a weekend in Boston and this place was conveniently located two blocks from our apartment.

They have some amazing drinks here and the staff is super chill and friendly.  They have plenty of couches and chairs to sit down and unwind.  They also sell local art, which are nicely displayed on their walls."
82,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,8/17/2010,"Zume's has very good espresso, latte's, cappuccinos, coffee and teas. Their food menu is very good as well. Muffins, scones, donuts and hot breakfast sandwiches. Very  very good. My only complaint is how expensive it is to come here. Other then that it would be five stars in my book.
Add on to previous review:
I moved Zumes down two starts. Though there coffee and food is very good I've noticed a disturbing decrease in customer service. It seems as if they are frustrated taking your order. 
My fiance' went in the other day to do work on her lap top. As she was setting up her lap top the owner came up to her and told her she had to buy food or coffee to work their. This was before she even had a chance to order anything. He was very rude and spoke to her like someone who was in middle school hanging out. 
Very disappointed in the ownership and his manners."
83,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,12/23/2009,"Really cute, cozy place. This is so close to being the ideal neighborhood coffee shop.  Just one problem: snotty staff.

I brought my laptop and went to plug it in and couldn't find any outlets.  I asked the girl at the counter if they had any outlets available and she said, ""no""  (rather curtly).  I then found a hidden outlet and plugged in.  Almost immediately a woman whom I assume to be the owner or manager rushed over to me, taps me on the shoulder and says, ""We DON'T have outlets for a REASON.""  Her tone was snarky and condescending - and she didn't tell me what that REASON was.  I told her my battery was dead so I would have to leave the cafe and go elsewhere. To which she replied, ""OK"".

Her tone was incredibly rude - and that's what turned me off.  

A few other things that tipped the scale to actually make me dislike the place:  I ordered a latte and it was lukewarm, watered-down and less than half full.  I also think its weird to have such a problem with someone wanting to plug in a laptop.

Who knew it as such a crime to plug in your laptop in a cafe.
I won't be going back."
84,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,8/26/2009,"I used to be a huge fan of Zumes just until up about a month ago. I was ordering 3 shots of espresso over ice and then adding some milk. After ordering one morning, one of the owners came up to me (while I was talking on my cell phone) and interrupted my conversation to tell me he was going to charge me for a latte the next I came in. I have never had a problem with ordering this drink before at any other cafes...it really turned me off. I have experienced the staff to be rude and not very friendly. When you go into a shop early in the morning a smile would really be nice! 
The reason it gets two stars from me is because their sandwiches are pretty good and they have good desserts and doughnuts."
85,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,6/10/2009,"I wish I could say that I love Zume's because I love the concept of it - and I actually do get my coffee there some mornings, and other mornings at Dunkin Donuts. It all depends on whether I feel like  starting my day with a scowl or a smile. Believe it or not, the ruder, less friendly option is at Zume's, not Dunkin Donuts!  The staff don't really seem to enjoy what they do at all.  In this economy, I often leave there thinking, why not let someone who'd actually like to be working do this job?

Why do I bother with Zume's? The coffee is stronger than D&D, and they have some healthy breakfast options. But that's about it.  From my experience, the staff at Zume's seem as though they are doing you the hugest favor by waiting on you at all. I've rarely seen any of them smile, and I often leave there feeling a little bit hassled and like I've just offended them by paying $7 for a coffee, banana, apple and yogurt. 

There is one blonde girl who works at the counter who is pretty sweet, and the woman who makes the food in the back is very nice, but everyone else leaves me cold. There are several people who I literally have never seen crack even the semblance of a smile in the entire year I've been going there. Not the best way to start the day."
86,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,6/20/2015,"Great service, great iced coffee. great location. I've been coming here for lunch every once in a while for the last few weeks, and it's a great spot. The breakfast sandwich on an english muffin pushed me over the edge, and onto yelp for the five star review!"
87,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,11/21/2010,"Decent food, cute atmosphere (for Charlestown...)...but the staff is RUDE. You walk in and begin to browse the menu and they are like, ""What do you want""...if you tell them you need a minute to decide, they will stare at you until you make up your mind. 
Not the kind of place you want to hang out and read the paper on a Sunday with your coffee. Wish there were more non-chain coffee shops!!!"
88,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,3/3/2010,"Found myself in Charlestown and needed to kill some time. We opted for this coffee shop. I really enjoyed sipping coffee here and it makes me think of those days when I lived in Boston and how there was SPACE to just sit and think! LOL. The coffee house has a bit of a Bohemian feel to it, wooden floors, and a few nice chairs. I had a slice of carrot cake and a coffee. The carrot cake was excellent. Moist and flavourful. It was a huge slice and I couldn't finish the whole thing. We were able to sit for about 2 hours with no one trying to kick us out. 

Also, on the day I left Charlestown, my best friend and I went in to grab some breakfast and she was raving about their english muffins. She says they make their own. I tried an egg and cheese on english muffin. She was right. The english muffin was fluffy and light. Better than anything Thomas could ever make ;-) This place is a winner!"
89,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,6/2/2014,"Worst customer experience ever - I was recently back to Charlestown after 15 years since moving away. I thought a place like Zume would be a good addition to an otherwise coffee desert. After ordering a coffee I noticed that there were no electrical outlets to charge my dead phone. When I asked, the young lady behind the counter said ""we don't have any customer outlets."" (Strange!)  Then when I pick up my drink I noticed that there was a plug on the back counter with one of the employees phones plugged in. I asked if I could charge my dead phone in that outlet, a manager/owner(?) was called over who told me with a total dead-pan look before walking away: ""that's for employees, we don't have power for customers."" That's it! No ""I'm sorry buts..."", No doing one little favor for a customer... Not the least bit of conciliatory offering what so ever! This place is the worse and deserves to go out of business.

ps: The iced coffee is just OK"

4,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,10/30/2021,"We found this place near the end of our stay in Boston.  The food was really delicious and a good value for the price.  We split an entree with chicken, vegetables (peas and green beans, potatoes) and rice.  The entree came with a salad that had some very tasty pickled veggies on top.  It seemed like you might be able to choose bread instead of rice with the entree.    If you want to pay with a credit card you have to go downstairs and my husband said there was a bad smell down there.  Takeout comes in styrofoam with plasticware."

6,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,2/22/2020,"My go to spot for halal meat in the city.
They have pre-cleaned and pre-packaged drumsticks and chicken breasts. Fresh meat/chicken is also available on order as per your request (small pieces or large)"
7,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,2/12/2021,"I found this place by sheer accident, while I was visiting the Heymarket. As others here mentioned, it is a literally a hole in the wall. Nothing fancy about this store at all, but the meat is always super fresh. For some reason the store often has a bad smell, especially on Friday and Saturday. Not sure what the reason is but be warned. The staff are very welcoming, and the service is quick. I've never been disappointed with any of my purchases here."
8,Garden Halal Meat,2 star rating,4/19/2017,"I was very disappointed by the food here. Went in with high expectations to try some good halal food but everything was below average, wasn't worth the wait time and money. 

Tried the chicken platter and it was missing flavor. Also got the sandwich and wasn't impressed by it at all.

Definitely not recommend this place if you have had real halal food before."
9,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,6/13/2015,"This morning while shopping at Haymarket I stopped in at Garden Halal Meat. This little ""hole in the wall"" store is located in the basement level but is a haven for incredible meat, fish and Middle Eastern foods.

We ended up buying fresh shrimp, naan as well as some spices. The staff here isn't the most receptive, but they get the job done and for the prices here that is at the bottom of the totem pole of concerns.

Overall, the store is great and it is a go-to location when shopping at Haymarket."
10,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,10/12/2018,"this restaurant is my fav one when it comes to Algerian/Morrocan food, they serve really delicious food for cheap prices, they got special plate on friday (Couscous) which is famous traditional algerian plate.

My favorite stop when going through that area"
13,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,2/16/2015,"The restaurant owners are very nice but a little shy. You can get anything from pizza to shawarma to kabab dinner plates. A kabab dinner cost less than $10 and is still filling. The kicker is the restaurant is open until 2am most days!

The shop under the restaurant has chicken ~$2/lb and red meat ~4/lb and the meat is fresh. Lots of exotic fruit juices and the spices are good quality. 

Worth the visit!"
14,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,1/4/2013,"Like Don W., I am reviewing the store underneath the restaurant, which is not marked and looks rather sketchy as you descend down into the dark, but it is brimming with all kinds of well priced items and a couple of misplaced pigeons. 

Garden Halal is not just a meat store. (I do not eat any meat at all and got lots of items here.) The butcher, the baker, the fishmonger and the olive grower all contribute to the huge assortment of products. You can scoop up a varied selection of olives, find well priced, authentic Nutella (the one in the glass jar- much better) and pick up some lentils, huge jars of spices, cookies, pastries or even some cooked shrimp. (Their fresh fish looks fine, but I have not purchased any yet, out of loyalty to New Deal.) If you like good prices, independently owned specialty markets and lots of choices, you need to make this a destination next time you are in the vicinity of Haymarket or Government Center. 

Based on the number of people down here on my first visit, this place is a hidden jewel with much to explore. It's right near Harry's Cheese Shop (also a treasure) and there are two entrances, but they are not well marked. Descend you must. Just don't trip over the pigeons who mix, mingle and coo around the boots and shoes of us busy shoppers."
15,Garden Halal Meat,3 star rating,4/16/2017,"This is a difficult rating for me to give them. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma wrap ($6.99) to go. Then I sat there waiting for about 10 minutes, wondering what was going on. I could see the guy behind the counter, but he didn't look like he was doing anything about my order. After a while, I realized he must've been cooking the chicken in the back. After a while I saw him pick up a wrap (not a pita wrap though; some sort of weird hybrid between a tortilla and pita), and then start asking me which toppings I wanted (lettuce, tomatoes, olives, onions). And then he asked me if I wanted mayo or ranch. Stop. I'm sorry, did you say MAYO and RANCH?! Do you think I'm some kind of uncultured buffoon? Hell no, I'm not putting that in my wrap. So I told him no, and started feeling a little off-put. He started wrapping up my order, and I realized I never saw him add tzatziki sauce (which was on the description of my order, and lets be real, basically makes or breaks any Greek-style order). Which I asked him. And he replied, ""we don't have any"". We don't have any as in we are out, or as in it has never set foot in our store?? Then he asked me again if I wanted mayo or ranch. Still said no to that one. So I left the place feeling slighted. I feel like that's something he should've said at the beginning. It's quite simple: ""we don't have any tzatziki sauce, is that okay?"" Because honestly, I would've gone someplace else! I don't want a dry Chicken chicken Shawarma! Which it was. Don't mistake me, the meat was very good; well-seasoned and tender, but it didn't taste very authentic (not that ranch or mayo would've fixed that ), and every bite I took made me feel like I'd lost an opportunity to eat a delicious meal. It ruined the experience for me. In that regards, I rate the quality and taste of the food (4/5). I've had better, but it was good. And customer service gets a (2/5). That just really hit me hard. Particularly since I'm in town visiting, it's not as if I can just go back next week and get it again, with tzatziki (not that they're guaranteed to have any, since apparently ""we don't have any"" is the new ambiguous response""). And I feel like my 7 bucks fell short. Anyways, moral of the novella: ASK IF THEY HAVE TZATZIKI BEFORE YOU ORDER."
16,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,8/6/2015,"great hole in the wall restaurant. Food is delicious, filling and affordable. They have a $10 credit card minimum so remember to bring cash. Service is friendly. Don't come expecting constant check ups but they do take care. Will definitely come back."
17,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,5/8/2010,"Garden Halal has a secret.  Underneath the restaurant is the store and this is a review of the store.  There's no sign that I could see, but the packages of food all say Garden Halal Market.  There are tons of Middle Eastern goodies, a Halal butcher, and my favorite: a fish counter with some really good prices!  We just picked up some gorgeous tuna steaks for $4.99/lb.  Come here on a Saturday, buy everything but the vegetables here and then go outside and finish your shopping.  You'll pay about half as much as you'd pay in the supermarket.

And if you're a tourist staying somewhere near Faneuil Hall, this is a good place to pick up some snacks and it's the side of Boston that doesn't have the ""Lobstah"" and ""Hahvahd"" t-shirts."
18,Garden Halal Meat,3 star rating,8/5/2009,"We discovered Garden Halal as if it dropped from the sky. As North End residents, we often tire of Italian cuisine. Sometimes we just want a good sandwich or shawarma. It was about 9 pm and all the shawarma restaurants we could think of were probably already closed or not within walking distance. We just about gave up and went to Hot Tomatoes when we spotted Garden Halal's neon sign in the distance. Lo and behold, a shawarma restaurant!

Garden Halal is basically a take out place/deli. Its menu has sections for Somali cuisine, Italian-style subs & pizza (slices are pretty cheap - $1.25 to $1.75 including Halal pepperoni), and shawarma. The deli had various salads, two chicken dishes, rice, some curry-type dishes. 

We each had beef shawarma sandwiches. It took a long time for them to make it--each beef strip is freshly grilled. (Unlike Boston Shawarma on Huntington, where the beef is already cooked). In addition to generous strips of beef, the sandwiches have fresh cilantro, tomato, garlic, and onion. There was very little dressing/sauce--pretty dry.  Each was $6 (tax incl.)

We also ordered a side of carrots. The carrots were cooked soft, chilled and marinated with cilantro, mint, olive oil, and vinegar. The side was $3.25 (tax incl.)

All in all, it was pretty good, and a nice alternative to eating Italian."
19,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,8/4/2012,"I was so happy when I found this place on a trip to Boston. It can be tough to find halal restaurants when traveling, but Garden Halal came to my rescue! If you go, I suggest walking over to the park and having a picnic like I did (if weather permits)  The food was reasonable and yummy, I will come back if I find myself in Boston again. : )"
