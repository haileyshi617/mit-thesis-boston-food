0,Scopa,5 star rating,10/12/2021,"One word. RONNIE. The most ELITE waiter my friends and I have ever come across. We went there for the espresso martinis, yet left with a new friendship.

Seriously though, the espresso martinis were top notch. We had about 12 between the three of us. Ronnie pulled out his tricks, and made us ""speciality cocktails"" after we decided we probably shouldn't have any more espresso martinis. The specialty cocktails were NOT on the menu. They were delicious. I'll be honest- we did not have any food. BUT, I will say it looked and smelled delicious. I wish I lived in Boston just so I can go hang out with Ronnie if I'm ever having a bad day.

PRIME Location- a block from The Paul Revere house and in Boston's exquisite North End. If you're in town, stop by Ronnie and have an espresso martini!"
1,Scopa,3 star rating,3/30/2022,"Cute little restaurant! I love little places like this. Cozy, cute, small number of tables. They have a beautiful pizza oven, which is a focal point when you walk in. We had our date night out here, so I just enjoyed our time with our food, and no toddler demands and screaming in the middle of it all. ;D 

We got a huge antipasto plate. By huge, I mean h-u-g-e. It was more than enough for the two of us. Along with that we had the calamari, which was very fresh and perfectly cooked. 

My hubs decided we needed to order a pizza too since that's what they're known for. We got the broccoli rabb and spicy salami pizza. The crust was great, but a little too heavy on the broccoli as it was hard to eat. 

Now this was our first dining experience in the north end, so I can't compare but it was decent and had a quaint little space. The service was good and attentive too. Can't really go too wrong, especially if other places have a long wait."
2,Scopa,5 star rating,4/8/2022,"Yeah this place is awesome, I enjoy everything on the menu. Service is great and food really good.."
3,Scopa,5 star rating,7/26/2021,Delicious pizza!! We got 3 pies for 3 people and it was the perfect amount. I could have eaten more if given the opportunity because it was so good. Perfectly cooked and great toppings. There aren't a ton of choices but there's sure to be at least one for everyone.
4,Scopa,4 star rating,2/21/2022,Super cute! We went around 6:45pm with a reservation and it was empty. Pizza was super good and good portion sizing. Staff was super nice and great location in the north end
5,Scopa,5 star rating,7/2/2021,Came around 12 to get lunch. The service was great and the establishment was clean! My table each got our own pizza and each was so SO delicious! I personally loved the Artichoke and Mortadella pizza!
6,Scopa,5 star rating,12/28/2021,Oh my god. I went with my parents to see a pizza restaurant and we went across this. The restaurant is so small and cute. One thing I would love to mention is the waiter. I think my parents would say the same. He was very understanding and he helped us pick out some food options. I loved how the place was not too big and it had very good music to listen to. I do not have any problem with this restaurant  neither do I have any problems with the food. Please do come back here to have a good time. Just know to go at the right time so you don't go at a time where it's packed. I wish I could give this  restaurant a 6....
7,Scopa,5 star rating,1/17/2022,The pizza here was amazing.  We were just wandering the north end yesterday and came across it. The smell of the pizza cooking enticed us to order some when we were just there for drinks. And it did not disappoint hot and crispy crust with gooey cheese in top. Service was also fantastic.
8,Scopa,5 star rating,3/3/2019,"Ten Stars!!! This place is aaaaaaaahmazing!

It's just a little restaurant with seating for about 22-25. The cook and the server are both very friendly and accommodating. With a small menu, I didn't identify anything that I was interested in (from my Americanized view of Italian food) and the server helped me choose a plate that I would fall in love with. 

We all ordered something a little different and agreed that it was likely the best Italian we've ever tasted. While we like to try new places when we visit the North End, we will definitely be visiting here again.

The only con we have is the portion size to price. Even in the North End we've experienced larger portions for the cost. However - I will say the portions are just right if you don't want to indulge and overstuff yourself."
9,Scopa,4 star rating,7/4/2021,"It's a nice little spot. They had been closed since December but recently reopened. I asked the server if it was COVID that caused the closure and it was. The place only probably has 25 indoor seating spots (more outside for summer dining) and with former COVID capacity restrictions they closed waiting for those to be lifted, which they now are. I guess it was tough during the winter when you could only have 10 people at a time. Anyways, glad they're reopened on to my visit. Right now they only have pizza and appetizers but will be adding back entrees in the next few weeks. It being lunch I had the arancini and meatballs appetizers which were both really really delicious. I saw other parties with pizza and that looked great too. This place will be terrific once they're back up to full speed and I will return to try the entrees!"
10,Scopa,2 star rating,9/20/2020,"Where are all the good reviews coming from?  We had dinner last night and there was only one other table and the service was painfully slow. There wine list is surprisingly void of many Italian wines. We ordered the Barbara and they were out but it took 15 minutes to tell us that. Of Course the bottle they had was 30% more.
The bread and oils were well presented and very good. The charcurerie board was adequate but was strange with only one cheese that we had no idea what it was.  The burrata  was delicious but it is burrata and kind of hard to mess up.  
The Bolognese was ok, although the hand made fettuccine was gummy.  The pizza was jus an average pizza. The carbonara was pretty much the most epic fail of a dish I've ever tasted. Tasted like pure heavy cream. Have they ever had carbonara? At least they took it off the bill. 
Yup, won't be back and assuming they should be closing soon."
11,Scopa,4 star rating,8/30/2019,"Food and service is fast and excellent.  My shrimp risotto was delicious and another in my group had the Frutti Del Mar, which looked really good.  I think that was the winning dish for our group.

Came here on a Wednesday night without any reservations.  No wait and no crowds, I'm glad we gave this restaurant a shot.  

Complimentary bread looked delicious.  Our group ate it all up.  Prices are competitive with the other local places.  Look at the pics on Yelp and make your pick.  Everything is good."
12,Scopa,4 star rating,8/24/2019,"Was looking for Italian and wine and ended up at Scopa. On a street of busy restaurants we found a table facing Mikes Pastry and had a lovely meal.

Service: excellent! The server was quick and also funny. 

Atmosphere: cute but not a lot of tables inside. Don't come where with a party of over 10. 

Food: ordered the eggplant appetizer, and ravioli pasta dish. Both were excellent and vegetarian. I was quite happy with the meal. We also got a side of bruschetta to share which was also tasty. Finally, the wine was great. It was brought to my attention that the wine was less expensive if we found it at a wholesaler. But it was pairing nicely with the food. 

Parking: there seems to be lots downtown. Street parking is rough in this neighborhood."
13,Scopa,4 star rating,8/12/2018,"[4.5/5] After checking out an apartment in the North End after work, The Boy and I decided to get dinner and took a short stroll to Scopa. The menu here is short, sweet and simple but the food here is anything but!

To start they give you pizza-like bread with 3 olive oil dipping sauces - regular, one with chili flakes, and another with minced garlic. Love the variety of sauces, definitely get your dip and intermix them!

The Boy got the Carbonara which had a perfectly poached egg and I got the Mushroom and Feta pizza. The pasta dish was really good. The pasta is made fresh. The portion may seem small - you will definitely be left wanting more - but it's truly the perfect portion. You don't walk away in a pasta coma from overeating, but that being said, it does feel pricey for the amount that you get; however, to not walk away in a carb coma was worth price and we both left really satisfied.

Definitely planning to come back and try some of their other pasta dishes! The servers were also really welcoming and friendly, service with a smile for sure."
14,Scopa,4 star rating,10/5/2019,Charming restaurant that we stumbled upon after walking up the street and we were in luck because we didn't have to wait for a table. We tried the spaghetti carbonara and the artichoke ravioli. Absolutely loved the warmth and flavor of the ravioli.
15,Scopa,4 star rating,10/15/2019,"DINNER REVIEW

So we ended up at Scopa the same way many people end up at restaurants in the North End around dinner time on weekends...you head to the great place you heard about, see the line/hear how long the wait is, and then decide to roam about to find something that looks good and had a shorter wait. That evening, Scopa fit the bill. 

We went to put our name in (for a group of 3) and ended up waiting maybe 20 minutes. This place is tiny (maybe only 20 seats) so any short wait was surprising. What Scopa lakes it size it makes up for in coziness. You are sitting elbow to elbow with your fellow diners and the nice folks preparing your food are right there in the back of the dining room. The wood-fired oven makes me excited to order their pizza.

They start you off with a warm flatbread with 3 different olive oils, one plain, one with parmesan, and another with red pepper flakes. Though the ingredients are simple and few in number, the tastes are distinct. This was a great way to start the meal.

With the wood-fired oven calling our name from the kitchen, we knew we had to get a pizza to start so we got a classic Margherita pizza. It had the perfect balance of crispy crust in the middle and chewy/doughy around the perimeter of the pizza. Would 100% order again.

For my entree, I had the Pollo Parmigiana (aka Chicken Parmesan). The chicken was very moist, especially for chicken breast, and I think I could have eaten 5 of them. The cheese ravioli they came with were just ok: not particularly vibrant in flavor, I wish they were a bit hotter in temperature, and I wish there were more than just 4. Don't expect the huge portions at Scopa that you'll find at some of the other Italian restaurants nearby. One could say the portion size is proportional to the size of the restaurant, in this case.

Overall, a great meal and I would definitely recommend Scopa if you are wandering the North End and trying to decide where to eat. You might just get lucky and get seated quickly here."
16,Scopa,5 star rating,11/30/2019,"Great food and service was wonderful. I just wish the made dessert. 3.99 stars 

Ricotta gnocchi with pesto and mussels -very light and clean flavors 

Calamari with shisito peppers 

Chicken Parmesan with fresh pasta - 

Great wine selection"
17,Scopa,5 star rating,8/19/2019,"Really small restaurant, but the food was amazing. I got the gnocchi with mussels and wow! The gnocchi had a great texture and it was cheese stuffed. The only thing was that it got quite salty as I was finishing my dish. We were also a little bummed that they weren't serving pizza even though they have a pizza oven and there were pizza photos on Yelp.

 I believe their menu changes often but worth a stop."
18,Scopa,5 star rating,6/4/2018,"From the pizza to the cheese platter to the service, we were just blown away by everything here at Scopa. The waiter did mess up our order but he was super nice about it, fixed the mistake, and brought us what we asked for in record time. He even brought over an extra plate of bread for us to have with the cheese platter even though it didn't come with it. You can tell that the ingredients here are fresh and that everything you want is made to order. I haven't had a pizza this good in years. Highly recommend the one with arugula on top! It also had some type of bacon underneath. Ugh I'm drooling just thinking about it. 

It's a small little restaurant so it wouldn't be good for a large party but it's so cute inside and very classy looking. If I'm ever in Boston again this is where you will find me."
19,Scopa,5 star rating,5/26/2019,"My partner and I were wandering north end and stopped in at Scopa. We stopped in and split a cheese plate, the gnocchi, and lobster ravioli. All were very good. The cheese plate had 3 cheeses and a fig jam. It also came with bread and 3 olive oil mixtures. The oils were good quality and the jam complemented the cheeses. The gnocchi was good, but it was firmer than I'm used to. The ravioli was really good and flavorful. Both sauces were fresh and good. 

Only downside was that it was a little expensive, but not outrageous."
20,Scopa,3 star rating,5/4/2018,"I went here on a Tuesday night and there was no wait. The location doesn't take reservations but no big deal. 

I ordered the porcini mushroom risotto and it was prepared well. I enjoyed the farmers cheese and the blueberries added a unique and sweet bite. The service was extremely attentive and kind.

The reason why I'm giving Scopa three stars is because I feel like something is missing. I'm not sure if the risotto wasn't hearty enough, or if I was looking for actual mushrooms in the risotto, but I felt like my meal was good not great."
21,Scopa,3 star rating,4/5/2019,"The North End is just jammed with Italian restaurants. So you go and try. I met a friend for lunch and we walked past at few times and read the menu and they just happened to have a table! The place is tiny or ""intimate"" if you are on a date. Margherita pizza and the short rib gnocchi was what we shared. It was good and done well. The gnocchi portion was on the small side and could have used a bit more salt. It's good Italian, but not stand out."
22,Scopa,4 star rating,9/15/2017,"Cute place for dinner. No wait for two on a Rainy Friday night (although larger parties were standing outside). Seating area is small about 10 tables and a counter area facing out to Hanover St (great for people watching). 

We were seated promptly. Started with wine and octopus with honey crisp apples and meatballs. They bring out warm flatbread with olive oil (excellent). I had the short rib with truffle gnocchi and brother had the brick chicken. Gnocchi was three large cylinders; would've preferred cut pieces. The short rib was cooked well but wished it had some more acidity. The brick chicken was good. If you're looking for a traditional/cozy dinner dish that is your best bet. 

Food was good, just not quite what we were hoping for. But loved it nonetheless."
23,Scopa,4 star rating,9/9/2017,"Scopa is an intimate, handsome Italian restaurant serving up some decadent meals.  Not a lot of seating, but we didn't have trouble getting in on a Sunday evening.

Our waitress was very pleasant and prompt.  She was very apologetic after spilling a little water on my menu and plate.  

We had the arancini, carbonara, and short ribs.  The arancini was the weak link.  It was almost overwhelmed by an almond extract type flavoring.  Not sure where that came from - maybe the breading? - but they were just alright.

The short ribs were incredibly tender.  My boyfriend loved them.  He thought the truffle gnocchi was, well, too truffle-y, but he wasn't expecting much else (he loves short ribs, but not truffles, so).  

The carbonara was the best part - some of the best carbonara I've had since visiting Europe.  The egg was placed on top so you got to burst the yolk and mix it up with the noodles.  Fun and absolutely delicious.  Like all carbonara, it was VERY rich and as such it was hard to finish all of it. 

I guess the restaurant was a little more expensive than we were expecting (although we could have gotten pizzas - those were practically steals).  Still, Scopa was a great way to finish off a great vacation to Boston!"
24,Scopa,5 star rating,7/28/2020,"Wow.  If you love pizza and are a pizza foodie, then this is a MUST HAVE.   Little joes on Carmine in NY, Pequods in Chicago and now Scopa in Boston.  Anyone rank below 5 stars, I would think a ""#Karen"" rated it."
25,Scopa,3 star rating,12/13/2019,"Nice intimate atmosphere. Nice service. The focaccia bread and the olive oil served as appetizer were great!
The pizza was also very good nice crust. 
The reason why I gave three stars 
The linguini with clam was too greasy and the sauce too heavy compared to the true Italian ""spaghetti alle vongole"" 
The arugula salad was good but not great, full in flavor. 
The meal was good overall. My portion was small,  I just do not think the value is there given that is not a cheap place to eat."
26,Scopa,3 star rating,10/26/2020,"Not bad food, portions were not as big as some of the other restaurants in the north end. Especially being the same price, I expected more. I ordered the pollo al limone and it was pretty good, but it could've been a bit more flavourful. Not many options for white wines. I probably wouldn't go back here. Good service though!"
27,Scopa,4 star rating,7/19/2019,Amazing caprese and gnocchi al forna I was pleasantly surprised. I walked by this restaurant a lot but never went inside. Loved the service and meal.
28,Scopa,5 star rating,9/1/2018,"Great friendly service.   Little bit of flatbread and three olive oils (plain, with cheese, and chili's) for complimentary bread.  

The carbonara was on point!  Nice crispy pancetta.  Noodles perfect al dente with a very rich and creamy pecorino sauce with a poached egg that adds just the right amount of additional creaminess.  

Was also looking at the Octopus/ Polpo, and almost regret not ordering it.   If only I had more of an appetite!  Surprising right?   But had to save room for Mikes pastry across the street."
29,Scopa,2 star rating,9/29/2019,"Walked in to a mainly empty restaurant after peak lunch hour.  Server seemed to have an attitude that we had a stroller with us and the delusion that the empty restaurant will get full after the lunch hour rush.  As a result, we ended up leaving which was unfortunate as the reviews appear solid. 

Walked next door to another restaurant that accommodated the stroller with no issues.  After our lunch we walked by Scopa and noticed the place was completely empty!

I get most North End establishments are small but sometimes you have to use your judgement during off peak hours."
30,Scopa,3 star rating,9/4/2018,"This is a small restaurant in walking distance from the Paul Revere house. The cheese plate and complementary bread were incredible. I would go again just for these items. The meatballs were flavored just right and had a lovely crunch to them.

Now, on to the misses:

The octopus was cooked unevenly, so some parts were chewy, while others were tender.

For our entrees, our table shared the portobello mushroom flatbread and Margherita pizza. Both badly needed seasoning. The flavor improved when we added salt and crushed red pepper. But, there was much to be desired from the entrees.

In summary, a good place for appetizers."
31,Scopa,5 star rating,6/23/2019,"This place was awesome. Great service, delicious food, we enjoyed everything! The Burrata app  was out of this world!"
32,Scopa,4 star rating,9/1/2018,"Carbonara! Fun tiny spot on Hanover street. There are so many places to choose from and my wife and I can't argue lines if we show up for a non-planned dinner. I quickly read this place was solid and it delivered. 

We started with the meatballs and crochettes. Both were very good. The meatballs were actually crispy and I believe fried as a finish. Unique touch (I guess Venetian?). 

We then were recommended the spaghetti carbonara and then also added the portobello pizza. The carbonara was the best I've had in years. Thick spaghetti (adamantly defenses by the waiter that this was the right way to have carbonara) with a delicious moderately heavy cream sauce. The pizza was also tasty but my wife and I were basically dueling over the carbonara. 

You can see the items were reasonably priced for the location and quality. Great service for a small place. Would go back."
33,Scopa,5 star rating,7/15/2018,"We were waiting in line for daily catch and ScopA actually opened on time so we decided to give it a try. Non of us were disappointed. The calamari was a bit blan , but the pizza was soft and tasty!! Then came over if the best carbonara dishes I've ever had. Service was prompt and friendly. Def a good spot."
34,Scopa,4 star rating,5/9/2019,"this was a great find in the north end! it was one of the only places we could find that didn't have an hour long wait to sit down. it is a small, quaint restaurant. 

we ordered the caprese salad, the burratta & prosciutto appetizer and then the lobster ravioli. the burratta appetizer was delish!! it resembled a charcuterie board, especially with the complimentary bread. 

the lobster ravioli was very filling and tasted quite like lobster bisque soup. Overall, we were very satisfied with our meal & service!"
35,Scopa,2 star rating,4/27/2018,"Pictured is the spaghetti carbonara which I had high hopes for but was let down. The noodles were clearly very high quality but the carbonara sauce was a little different than I normally like it. There was an egg on top as well which was good but less than impressive. 

Service was very good and the meal came with really good bread as an appetizer but overall I don't think I would come back."
36,Scopa,2 star rating,6/2/2018,"It's ok. Given the number of exceptional North End restaurants in just a few block radius, I probably would not pick this one again. 

Our appetizer was topped with a fig compote, which was terrible. Gloppy, overly tart and difficult to eat without making a mess, I definitely regret ordering it.

My butternut squash ravioli with brown butter sage sauce was very bland, and the puree it was served with didn't hit the mark for me. 

Staff was very friendly, and prices are quite reasonable though."
37,Scopa,4 star rating,7/12/2019,"Small cozy place that can accommodate 25-30 people. The bread served with olive oil had rosemary and parmesan, which was unique and delicious. The entrees looked small but were quite filling. This was one of the only restaurants we passed that didn't have a ridiculous wait and the food was great. We were the only ones in there for the entire duration of our dinner, but it was nice because we were able to talk without having to yell. Being so close to the window also allowed us to people watch while we waited for our food."
38,Scopa,3 star rating,6/9/2019,"Maybe because we've had Italian in Italy, our expectations were a bit different.

After battling terrible traffic, we were able to claim the last two top table. Note, there is only one server because they have seating for only about 25-30 people. We ordered a caprese to start, and a spring risotto and chicken parm for our meal.

The complimentary bread was really good and nice to eat with the caprese. The salad was nice and fresh and tasted like home made cheese. I wish they had included one more slice to make it a 4:4 ratio of tomato to cheese. 

Our food was sitting under the warming lamp for a while but nothing arrived cold. The risotto was cooked well with a good amount of veggies. I hate lima beans so I should have asked what was included. The chicken parm was dry and didn't include any pasta, only fried eggplant.

For the amount of money we paid for the meal after tip (over $70), I would have expected to be blown away a little more than we weren't. There are plenty of Italian restaurants on this block that I think we would have been better off going to one of those.

If you need to use the bathroom there, the room itself makes it feel like you are on an airplane."
39,Scopa,5 star rating,10/28/2017,"We had a great meal at this tiny little place.  

Butternut squash ravioli was perfectly prepared and the Carbonara was very good, although it could use a more pancetta.

Parking- While we walked to the restaurant I wanted to point out to those from out of the area that the parking in the area can be limited to residents with active ticketing.  We sat at the window and say five cars get ticketed during our meal.  Be warned."
40,Scopa,5 star rating,1/31/2019,"Scopa is a tiny, cute restaurant in the North End. The pasta is homemade and fresh. The Bolognese was some of the best I've ever had. I also really enjoyed the warm bread they served with a trio of olive oils. 

In addition to the perfectly cooked food, our server was wonderful. She was friendly, funny and very accommodating when the cold draft from the door kept blowing in. 

I'd highly recommend trying this place. It's a hidden gem."
41,Scopa,5 star rating,3/28/2019,"Locally owned Italian restaurant that will certainly not disappoint. My nosey self sat with a few directly out at the street as I people watched my entire meal. As all the other restaurants near here we're booked or an hour long wait, I walked right in here and got seated. The staff was super friendly and I'm not just saying that. We ended up having a conversation about our lives and dreams. It was overall a pleasant experience & the food was the best American itailian I've had in the area."
42,Scopa,4 star rating,7/27/2017,"Scopa is a beautiful place for a fantastic meal. The wait was about 10 minutes on a warm Thursday evening around 6pm. We were offered a table at the large open window but chose an inside table instead (for a shorter wait). While the large street-facing hightop table is a nice touch, the downside is that the rest of the small restaurant is quite warm (assuming they don't want to run an air conditioner because of the huge open windows).

The wine selections are fantastic and affordable. The braised shortribs and homemade gnocchi were a highlight - the meat fell of the bone and something as simple as the grilled carrots and fresh mozarella accent were top notch. The gnocchi is highly recommended.

We also ordered the fig and prosciutto pizza, which at $13 is hugely underpriced considering how delicious and well-made it is. The figs are cooked perfectly; the only downside was the dough could've been slightly more firm/cooked.

The service was impressively fast, friendly, and professional.

The restaurant is quite small but is tastefully decorated and has a comfortable, friendly feel despite the close quarters. It was slightly louder than ideal but it wasn't a major downside considering how great the food is."
43,Scopa,5 star rating,7/26/2019,We went there coz of hungry and it's right opposite Mike pastry so we wanna try.  The food was really good . We ate all clean....we got linguini with clam so yummy. My kids love spaghetti Carbonara. Risotto with shrimp is also good. Our server Alex is really nice. So friendly and helpful.
44,Scopa,4 star rating,3/4/2019,"Cute, quaint little spot in the North End. We visited on NYE 2019 and service was excellent. We tried the charred octopus, carbonara, and my husband had the squash raviolis. All dishes were superb and portion sizes were just right. I would highly recommend a visit if you're looking for a nice Italian dinner without the long waits."
45,Scopa,5 star rating,4/16/2019,"We were lucky enough to get in here without a reservation. Wonderful service and delicious food. We had the Burrata cheese and prosciutto for appetizer. The restaurant serves focaccia bread with 3 types of  olive oil, the meatballs were tender and delicious and our margherita pizza was baked to perfection. We loved this place and we will be back here next time we are in town."
46,Scopa,5 star rating,9/30/2018,"Scopa is the best Italian (real Italian, not Italian-American) restaurant in Boston. If you want chicken Parmesan, baked ziti, or anything drenched in marinara and covered in mozzarella, go elsewhere. There are a lot of good places in the north end, and a lot of really good places, but this is head and shoulders above the rest. 

It was as good as any food I've had while traveling in Italy. 

The staff is incredible. Alexander is one of the best hosts. The chefs are friendly and even made us fresh panino, the Italian waiter (apologies, I can't remember his name) was helpful with the wine list. We stayed after to chat with the staff, and they really treated us as if we were welcome guests, and not customers to shuffle in and out. The carbonara, without a doubt, is the best carbonara I've ever had in my life. Grazie mille!"
47,Scopa,5 star rating,8/13/2017,"Had excellent lunch there. This is small intimate place. Service was quite good, and the food shined there. Good Italian wine list too. We enjoyed caprese salad, and octopus as appetizers, both done right, risotto and especially Veal Milanese were well executed. Word of caution: no espresso drinks or gelato, go to Caffe Vittoria across the street for that, same owners, same friendly service and high quality"
48,Scopa,5 star rating,4/9/2019,"Delicious. Had the salmon and a roasted fig appetizer. Someone else at my table also had the salmon and both were cooked perfectly. 
Service was friendly and professional."
49,Scopa,5 star rating,9/12/2020,Best carbonara I've ever had! Cozy atmosphere and excellent service. We loved our experience here and will make a point to come back here whenever possible!
50,Scopa,5 star rating,7/2/2017,"Great place!!   We really liked Scopa !

I got the chicken under a brick
My kids got buttered noodles
And my wife got the bolognese noodles

But the big wins here were the super fantastic calamari and the super fantastic caprese  salad.   The salad had the best freshest mozzarella cheese I have ever had.  

It was a great small restaurant.  What a great find.  

We would definitely come back."
51,Scopa,2 star rating,2/17/2020,"So the family went to Scopa  for a Sunday night dinner. 
I was surprised to see open tables considering the place is relatively small with limited seating.  The seating is very tight and you can fully hear all conversations around you.  

Anyway, the food.  The opening flatbreads with 3 different olive oils- very good; crisp flatbreads, nice quality olive oil. 
The burrata cheese/prosciutto appetizer-very good; burrata  was creamy inside yet firm and the prosciutto was tasty.  
Following the appetizers it was all down hill.  
The Lobster fra diavolo  -- awful. Lobster was mushy and the sauce had a red bell pepper undertone. I sent it back.  
The gnocchi with sauce -awful.  Overcooked  pasta, mushy and with the same sauce as the lobster fra diavolo.  Veal saltimbucca- awful. Overcooked veal with an arugula side salad that was pre dressed  with heavy amounts of some biter tasting cheese. We all agreed, all the entrees sucked.  
On a bright note, the waiter was terrific considering he was working the entire floor in his own."
52,Scopa,4 star rating,1/26/2017,"Overall good experience and tasty food.

The room is very small, but was able to jump in and grab a table the last table for two at around 8pm.

We ordered the meat and cheese plate and toast and cheese/jam app.

I didn't realize until I was looking at photos of the bread that everyone gets that we didn't get toast. I assumed the bread must of been it and there was extra on board to save space at the time but now looking at bill it was never served to us, which actually makes more sense. 

The gnocchi was good but so hot that it nearly didn't cool down enough the whole hour. It also was slightly over cooked. The cheese and sauce was very good though. The boar rigatoni also had great flavor. 

Wine was good. Was not offered dessert before check came so I assumed they did not offer it. 

I would recommend to dates and would welcome going back to give it another try. There was plenty on menu that looked good."
53,Scopa,5 star rating,6/8/2019,Stopped in and enjoyed the margherita pizza and gnocchi. It was delicious. They were friendly and they had quick service. We really enjoyed our stop.
54,Scopa,5 star rating,11/7/2018,"Came here tonight on a whim and had a few glasses of delicious wine and an appetizer (meatballs - yum)! I immediately hit it off with the personable and fun waitress and we had a great talk.

Loved the cozy, inviting and intimate setting in here -- it's perfect for a romantic date.  Although I didn't get a chance to try more of their standard menu, I'll absolutely be back."
55,Scopa,5 star rating,6/5/2017,"My family and I went here for my graduation dinner and I couldn't have been happier with the choice, service, or the food. Scopa a small little cafe-esque restaurant that is tucked away in the cobblestones and brick buildings that litter the North End. But don't let the size fool you: the food is flavorful and the atmosphere makes you forget that you're in Boston. 

We first ordered a bottle of Chianti and a couple of appetizers (charcuterie, toast, calamari). The meat and cheese plate was incredible and featured what I believe was prosciutto and pancetta, as well as some sort of an apricot jam to pair with the cheeses. The toast was a step up from the ubiquitous avocado toasts of the world and was spread with creamy ricotta and the apricot compote from the charcuterie plate. The calamari was fried to perfections. My favorite part of the meal, however, was the short rib that I ordered.

I have never been moved to speak volumes about a short rib, but I would write sonnets about this one if I could. When it arrived, it sat steaming hot on a bed of risotto,  garnished with two sauteed carrots and cheese. Upon slicing into meat it slid easily off the bone and melted in my mouth. It is easily the best beef I've ever had in my entire life due to the texture and buttery taste. The risotto underneath was a perfect complement to the rib (made from polenta) 

Overall the perfect dining experience. I would go back every night for the short rib alone."
56,Scopa,5 star rating,6/24/2017,"Overall had a good experience. The wait was about 20 mins but it was well worth it.
Service was ok but food was great!"
57,Scopa,3 star rating,8/21/2020,Great food. Horrible service. I feel bad saying that because the waitress was nice and the food was delicious. But we saw 3 tables come and leave before they were served. Our food came in LONG waves- it wasn't busy on a Friday night on Hanover street so that should speak for itself. If feel bad for people that come here for a special meal.
58,Scopa,5 star rating,4/27/2019,Sooo amazing! Great food and great ambiance. Went on a nice day so they opened up the doors/windows and we sat looking out at the street. Overall great experience
59,Scopa,5 star rating,7/10/2016,"The North End is always packed on Friday nights. My friend and I went there and the line for every restaurant was absurdly long. We weren't planning to eat at Scopa but there was no wait and it had recently opened so we figured we should try it out.

We decided on a window seat and it was great. The service staff actually had to leave the restaurant and take our orders from outside. It was a fun and different experience. The wait staff were really good about delivering us excellent service.

I had a beef bolognese and a white wine I don't recall. The beef bolognese was the best I've had in my life. The noodles were great, the sauce was perfect and the beef was delicious. It was so good I contemplated getting another order. For dessert we had the dessert pizza. It was essentially globs of Nutella with a kick of rum. It was good and it was a nice way to finish off a meal.  

Great service and great food make Scopa a great addition to North End's many phenomenal restaurants."
60,Scopa,3 star rating,8/14/2020,Pizza was pretty good but their linguine with meatballs was a disappointment as the meat balls were burned and dry and the sauce was subpar
61,Scopa,5 star rating,7/23/2019,"Outstanding little restaurant! Very quiet and personal. We loved the stuffed figs, antipasto plate, lobster ravioli. The salmon was cooked perfectly too! We can't wait to go back again."
62,Scopa,5 star rating,8/28/2016,"A great alternative to waiting a the more popular north end restaurants! We came in around 8pm and had no wait. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and probably fits about 35 people total! Our server was great and really personable. We even stopped by the next day to see if we left something there and she remembered us.

For an app we got the artichokes and they were AMAZING. The only bummer was there were 3 of us and only 2 artichokes. I ordered the Gnocchi with buffalo mozzarella and it was great. The others at the table got fish and another pasta dish. We would definitely come back here the next time we are in the north end!"
63,Scopa,4 star rating,11/7/2016,"An impromptu stop this past Sunday afternoon for lunch which turned out to be a very pleasant surprise and experience.

Very small space, but comfortable and not your traditional Italian fair.  Creative dishes outside of the box, using fresh, seasonal ingredients.  Wine list compliments the menu perfectly too.

The meal starts with fresh bread and 3 different dipping oils.

For starters we tried the Limoncini, chef scallops and artichoke & butternut.  All three dishes were very good, the later being our favorite.

For our main dish we decided to split the harvest risotto which was absolutely AMAZING!  So delicious and flavorful.  

Service was polite but not overwhelming which can happen in such a small space.  Overall a great meal with great service.  We will definitely be back!"
64,Scopa,3 star rating,11/22/2016,"Nice, intimate restaurants that is A-OK but nothing too special. I probably just ordered wrong by getting the squash and the mozzerella salad.

The good:
+cute, non touristy location
+nice, friendly vibe. 
+cheap-ish...our meal was only 60 for 2 people and we had wine.
+relaxed service-- not rushed at all.
+good selection of food and the rissotto was very good.

The bad:
-does not take reservations
-food isn't outstanding by any means
-kinda cramped and very HOT since it's so small.

Would not come back but a nice place to try once in a while if you are in the area and can get bar seats for people watching!!"
65,Scopa,5 star rating,8/21/2016,"This place is right across from Mike's Pastry's.   It seats about 22-25 people.  I walked in on a Sunday and there wasn't a wait.  Decided on having my first lobster roll there.   I loved it!  The lobster was cut into huge pieces with the right amount of flavoring.  The toasted bread was so worthy of the lobster filling.  Found out that the bread was from the best bakery in Boston (Bricco: I later found the bakery down a narrow alley and down a few steps).   

Service was great.  Bathroom is tiny.  They didn't have dessert that day.  Seems like a newer restaurant."
66,Scopa,2 star rating,9/11/2020,"I have had dinner here many times over the past two years, the quality has definitely changed. The food as well as the service has many opportunities, We will not be returning."
67,Scopa,4 star rating,7/17/2016,"Stopped at Scopa on a Sat night when there were tables unavailable at other popular North End eateries. Upon being seated immediately at a table near the door - good for air on a humid summer evening - we learned that Scopa opened its doors about two months ago. Don't let its short stint on Hanover fool you, Scopa has potential for staying power with its eclectic twist on Italian classics with a seasonal and local flair. 

My friends and I enjoyed a charcuterie to start which included cheeses local to Massachusetts - a nice touch. Entrees were good too, two of us settling on the corn raviolis with blueberries and oyster mushrooms and the other opting for the homemade gnocchi.  Wine list seemed to be a handful of selections ranging from sparkling to white to red. A friend and I indulged in a bottle of Rose. 

Our favorite part of the meal was the dessert pizza which had peaches, strawberries and mint drizzled with mascarpone cheese. The pizza was light and refreshing, making it a delicious summer treat and appropriate accompaniment to the leftover Rose.

Service was good and personal - small restaurant, family-owned feel. 

Interested in seeing how Scopa evolves and makes a name for itself on Hanover."
68,Scopa,5 star rating,11/14/2018,"I don't usually like kale or octopus, the way the chef prepared both made me change my mind (not a small task), it was delicious.
Service was fast and friendly."
69,Scopa,4 star rating,6/22/2018,"Pizza was very good, flavorful dough. Bread with dipping oils also delicious. Spicy clam appetizer was good, and octopus was okay-small portion and lacked char. Our waiter Alex was 5/5 amazing service, very personable. We'll be back to visit him!"
70,Scopa,5 star rating,5/17/2019,"Alex was amazing! He gave exceptional customer service and was very helpful.  All the food was so so good, I highly recommend!"
71,Scopa,5 star rating,1/18/2018,"Scopa is the ideal North End date spot for young professionals. My girlfriend and I went there last night looking to have a nice Italian meal that didn't deplete my bank account and Scopa was up to the task!

The Good:

Food was tasty. We ordered the fried calamari, and the fig/Gorgonzola pizza. Both tasted as well as you'd expect from a place in an Italian neighborhood. What really stood out was the cheese on the pizza. It exploded with flavor when I took a bite. Idk if it was better quality ingredients or what, but it was yummy. 

The Not-So-Great:

This space is minimal. Scopa is tiny so if you are rolling more than 4 people deep, I'd look elsewhere. That said, my girlfriend and I were sat next to each other at a cute high rise table looking on to the street. I was skeptical of the arrangement, but I'm glad we sat that way as it mixes things up. Probably would be even better in the summer. 

All in all, Scopa was great, it has definitely earned its place in the rotation of mid-week date spots."
72,Scopa,4 star rating,6/28/2019,Exquisitely prepared Italian food and a nice quaint setting. The risotto with shrimp was some of the best I've ever had. I liked everything about this restaurant but to say the portion sizes were small would be generous. Even my children were asking to go get pizza after our meal and we are really not big eaters We were not expecting the massive portions of mediocre Italian food that other restaurants in the area serve but the pictures displayed are accurate
73,Scopa,2 star rating,5/28/2018,We went here after we tried to get a table for two at other places. The yelp reviews were promising so we thought why not ? It was a bad decision. The starter bread and calamari were fine. But the main dishes were horrible. My brother and I were so hungry that we ate it . But other than that the potato gnocchi had no proper flavour and the ravioli was not proper tasty below average. I would not recommend this place to a friend.
74,Scopa,5 star rating,8/3/2020,Best food on Hanover! Love the rosé sangria and atmosphere. Highly recommend putting it on your list!!
75,Scopa,5 star rating,11/25/2019,"Amazing! From the minute you walk in it's so warm and cozy! We went on Sunday and it was decorated for Christmas ! We started with the artichoke mescaline salad (amazing) !! Than we ordered the  meatballs  and on to what my 13 year said ""was the best egg plant she has ever tasted ""! The eggplant was stuffed with spinach n cheese  soo good! We ended our meal with a pizza (margarita) simple n delicious! I have a new favorite restaurant and it's Scopa !! 5 stars bravo"
76,Scopa,5 star rating,10/19/2017,"In a bog of predictably gimmicky, uninspired tourist food, Scopa stands confidently in the company of Bricco, Lucca, and other North End diamonds...tall talk considering the bargain price point.  This is a standout that can't be missed.  Intimate kitchen, personal service, great location.  Couldn't be happier.

Update - left the restaurant without our son's jacket...the waiter Alberto tracked us down, found us at Mike's pastry, and returned it to us.  That's a restaurant that cares.  Support this place."
77,Scopa,5 star rating,11/17/2018,"Quaint Italian restaurant in the North End.  The staff is very friendly! I forgot my credit card at home after I ordered a glass of wine, and they saved me spot for me while I ran home to get it.  I came back after 20/30 minutes and they had indeed saved my spot!  I ordered a glass of the Chianti Classico and the butternut squash ravioli.  The waiter brought out some hot bread with three types of olive oil - spicy, with cheese, and regular.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The ravioli were hot and while the butternut squash was sweet, the sage and other seasoning was not, so it was a perfect balance.  I would definitely go back!"
78,Scopa,5 star rating,7/17/2018,"Perfect pizza per my husband. Crust to die for. My pasta was delightful, though the portion could have been a teeny bit larger. Great service. Romantic spot in a cool neighborhood."
79,Scopa,5 star rating,6/6/2019,"Great authentic Italian.  The tagliatelle bolognese was the real deal.  Pasta was al dente with a sauce that was not overpowered with too many ingredients!  The risotto primavera was al dente, and most importantly the veggies were farm fresh, and not over the top.  Nothing I hate more than veggies with a little bit of rice. This was a true risotto, with a great balance of both.

Finally, the ambiance was perfect: small (only 7-8 tables plus open bar seating that overlooked the street with windows open on a beautiful night.  And the service was excellent and pleasant, from a true Italian waiter no less.  

I felt like I was in Florence eating at a great trattoria on the Oltrarno.  Loved it here"
80,Scopa,1 star rating,1/23/2018,"Sadly, I have to update my review. I went in recently to find out the previous chef had left and took most of the staff with her. Food was terrible and the owner was not pleasant at all. Makes me not want to support this local business. So bummed out!! Don't think I will go back or send anyone here again."
81,Scopa,5 star rating,8/30/2019,"Probably one of the best Italian restaurants I have ever been to, as well as one of the best in the North End. My lobster spaghetti was divine with just the right amount of spice. The ambiance is fantastic, the space is small and intimate. The service is outstanding- thank you Alex for such an amazing experience! Had to come back for the second time before I head back to California."
82,Scopa,3 star rating,10/16/2019,"Looking at pictures, I convinced my girlfriend to go here over her go to restaurant (La Familia). Small place with maybe only one other group in there. We were seated quickly but unfortunately we had to request bread even though it is complementary in the meal. The bread was a letdown, more like pizza crust and the oils weren't very flavorful. The roasted fig app and the Gnocchi al forno both were quite tasty and the food came out very quickly but portions were quite small for the price. Worth trying if you are in a rush but otherwise there seems to be several better options in the area for the same price range"
83,Scopa,5 star rating,10/14/2019,"Favorite restaurant in the north end! Had the meatballs, the Caesar salad with egg, and bolognese last weekend. Amazing! Went here a few times within the past year and have loved the meals whether lunch or dinner each time. Raydon, our waiter last weekend was fabulous. Looking forward to future visits"
84,Scopa,5 star rating,6/8/2017,"Tiny place, worth any wait to get in. Menu on the smaller side. Food is tasty; portions are reasonable and not overwhelming. The Farmer's Toast to start was lovely - basically ricotta and fig jam on toast. For entrée the Wild Boar Rigatoni was perfect. The guy sitting next to us had an amazing looking pizza. 

There are a lot of Italian places in the North End but I'd come here again."
85,Scopa,5 star rating,5/25/2018,Delicious flavors. Freshly made. Helpful and friendly staff. Really enjoyable experience! Yum!!
86,Scopa,5 star rating,6/10/2017,"A perfect dining experience in this charming, small Italian restaurant in the heart of the North End. In a long line at Giacamo's, I got a local to recommend another great option that would be w/out a line. He recommended Scopa, describing it as 6 tables, and open window, and busy but usually not a line. That is exactly what it is; but he failed to mention the great service on top of the great food. We had the sweetest server who went above and beyond. The small restaurant made the experience feel so personalized, which we loved. 

We started with the braised octopus and crispy pork belly. Both were excellent. For our entrees, we shared the short rib and pappardelle bolognese. The short rib was perfect. Quite large, extremely tender, accompanied by a lovely sauce and huge, amazing gnocchi underneath. The pappardelle was also quite good; clearly a lovely homemade pasta and nice sauce. I am not a nutmeg fan so that flavor profile wasn't for me, but otherwise, a great dish, esp for those that love nutmeg in their bolognese.

I look forward to a future visit to Scopa!"
87,Scopa,5 star rating,9/13/2019,Deliciousness!!! Great service & everything we ordered was amazing. Exceeded all expectations
88,Scopa,2 star rating,5/4/2019,"The food was average at best. The atmosphere was nice, but the food was not close to worth the price. I would not eat here again."
89,Scopa,4 star rating,8/23/2019,Small dining room but worth the wait. The Burrata was so delish as was the Chicken Parmesan.

1,Hurricane's at the Garden,2 star rating,11/7/2021,"I want to start off by acknowledging the staff shortage in the restaurant business. However, waiting just over 20 minutes for a drink, a basic water is unacceptable.  My wife got the Frenchie cocktail which she loved and I got a Guinness. Took 45 minutes to get our order of a medium burger (ended up just being a frozen Patty) and an order of Mac and cheese."
2,Hurricane's at the Garden,2 star rating,10/9/2021,"We only ordered a water and a coke and the waitress got it wrong. No biggie I understand it's a busy place, but she also got the food order wrong and I didn't say anything because again whatever. But the food was just bad like I got a chicken sandwich and it was so burnt and tough and chewy. Basic food, not good, just a place to go before any TD garden event I guess. Apps are over priced too lol"
3,Hurricane's at the Garden,1 star rating,6/7/2021,"Terrible .. went there for the 630 bruins playoff game , at 330 we showed up at the door and they treated us like we were obnoxious for showing up so early . A waitress came out to grab a package and we asked what time opening was and she said hopefully never "" hopefully never "" .. what a joke ! We sat down for 2 titos and soda and both tasted like just soda water . I think the vodka bottles were legit watered down . I went across to banners and total other experience . I grew up here , ill never go hurricanes again . Scumbags!!!"
4,Hurricane's at the Garden,1 star rating,5/15/2021,"Earlier today I wanted to make a reservation for myself and 5 others for the Bruins game (started at 7) AND UFC Fight (started at 10). I went to make a reservation online and the only reservations they were taking were for the UFC Fight with that window of reservations starting at 9pm (plenty of reservations available). This fight also came with a $15 cover charge per person which we were fine with paying, but didn't make one online because we wanted to go earlier for the Bruins game.

Because of this, I called the restaurant early afternoon to see what I should do since I wanted a table for both events. The guy I talked to was great and said to just come in for the Bruins game because they'd have plenty of tables before the UFC fight, and we'd be good to stay for the fight afterwards as well. I talked to the same guy when I got there and we had an enjoyable time watching the Bruins game even though they lost.

When the fight started, the manager came around to collect a cover charge for the fight as expected. However, when he came around he upcharged us and asked for $20 per person, saying that the charge was $15 only if you made a reservation and $20 if you didn't. I explained to him that I didn't make an online reservation because I had called earlier and agreed to an arrangement with the gentleman that I had talked to. 

After going back and forth he was still persistent on charging us $20 a head. So to summarize, we were essentially penalized for coming 2 hours early and spending $400 on food and drinks during the Bruins game. I could've made a reservation and paid the $15 per person ahead of time but again didn't do this because of the arrangement agreed upon on the phone and because of the fact that they weren't even offering reservations starting at 7 as the place wasn't expected to be full. 

I was excited for Hurricanes to open back up as I live on the block and have gone there regularly, but will be taking my business to Banner, Tavern, etc for the foreseeable future. The gap between $15 and $20 is negligible, but we decided to leave and watch the fights at my apartment out of principle."

6,Hurricane's at the Garden,1 star rating,8/2/2021,"I was recently at Hurricanes for a LGBTQIA takeover a couple of weeks ago. We had a women performer which did in fact include some risque dancing - something the crowd enjoyed and in fact probably bought more drinks as a result of. The owner came out angrily at the event coordinators for this performance saying they ""weren't allowed"" to host something like this, and then they turned all of the lights on at 1:15-30am and kicked out every patron, 30 minutes before the club scene in Boston is legally required to end at. There wasn't even so much as a last call - they just completely turned the lights on. 

Regardless of rules - you should not be kicking out  EVERY paying patron due to your own emotions or personal issues with the event coordinator. We were all having a blast only for it to be ruined by what genuinely felt like a homophobic gesture from a cis white male bar manager/owner (?). Would they have done this in a ""straight"" event? Probably not. I've never once experienced this type of behavior in Boston at any clubs/bars and have seen performances like this a dozen-plus times.... nevertheless seeing this behavior being exhibited by the actual OWNER/manager coming out and then making the patrons feel incredibly uncomfortable, at least I felt that way. I will not be going back to say the least nor will LGBTQIA events be hosted there moving forward from this event coordinator. Create a real safe space for your LGBTQ patrons."

When I returned after to wait for an Uber, thinking it was a safe place, I was treated disrespectfully. They seem extremely nervous about over-serving which is something I've never experienced. I can only imagine they've gotten in trouble before. So unnecessary."

She was great! Made the drinks strong! (Hurricane on the tap and crown Apple with cranberry) Had a light convo with us and the food came out quick for a game night! Wasn't crazy packed but the space is big.

I had buffalo wings and my friend had the Chicken BLT with fries. My wings were great. My friend said his sandwich was alright. 

Came back after the game and Maia helped us out (told her we'll be back and she remembered!) kitchen was closed unfortunately but we had the same drinks. 

Definitely would come back!"

I got a pastrami sandwich with fries and a few beers. The pastrami was really good and tasty, the bread was crunchy as well. The place was pretty empty after the game which u was surprised about, so our service was pretty fast, if it had been busy I'm not sure how the service would have been. My friends and I had a good time chatting away for a while here."
14,Hurricane's at the Garden,2 star rating,7/2/2018,"The atmosphere​ is blah​ - we ended up here because the other restaurants were full. They were able to seat us within 15 minutes.

Food is average and what you would expect at a bar. You can't go wrong with burgers and waffles fries. DO NOT get the Drunken Mule - it's a horrible tasting drink. I was going to give them 3 stars but that drink was so bad I'm giving a 2 instead."
15,Hurricane's at the Garden,1 star rating,4/12/2019,"Have to say this place looks lame. They didn't allow us in cause we were louder and walked down the street enjoying the good weather and life.

Our bartender Rick was very attentive, knowledgeable and made the best green (go celts!) tea shot I ever had in my life. You know a good bartender when your Diet Coke is refilled before you even ask for a refill!

I usually go to the fours before games but I now have a new pre game spot for life in hurricanes."

It smelled new.. it feels like a bar, but not a lot of bar food options. I got a Greek salad. It consists of iceberg lettuce (flavorless, nutritionless), cucumber, tomatoes, some other preserved vegetables and store bought dressings. it was no good"
20,Hurricane's at the Garden,3 star rating,8/19/2018,"Stopped in for small bites around 4pm. It had the perfect menu for us - burgers, sandwiches, pizza, hot dogs, etc.  My son had a burger and it was great.  My daughter had the Mac & cheese and liked it.  My wife had the clam chowder and thought it was a bit too salty. 

I had the Buffalo chicken wrap.   It had a couple of problems. The biggest problem was that there wasn't much chicken in the wrap, it was mostly breaded crust saturated with buffalo sauce. Very little chicken meat. Also, it had crumpled blue cheese. You might say ""what's wrong with that?""  Well, wings go down nicely with blue cheese dressing, but so much with crumpled blue cheese.  Try a mouthful of blue cheese crumples and see if it doesn't just suck the saliva out of your mouth.  

Service was okay, but we had to flag down the waitress for water, which is something we usually never have to do."

23,Hurricane's at the Garden,1 star rating,1/17/2018,"My friend and I stumbled upon hurricanes when looking for a place to grab a quick bite before a Celtics game. We decided to go to the game last minute so all the good restaurants were jam packed with people already. When we walked by hurricanes we saw that it was relatively empty as compared to the other packed restaurants and bars in the area. We went in and the hostess said there was a 20 min wait but could be sooner so we grabbed a drink at the bar and waited. It only took about 10-15 minutes and we were seated by the window. The first thing we noticed was the decor, or should I say lack of decor. Everything was awkwardly spaced out with so many dead spaces not being used properly that it made the entire space awkward and lacking something. There wasn't one thing hanging on the walls except for the numerous TVs all playing the same channel...in a sports bar... where typically multiple games play... but hey what do I know. 

Although our waitress was nice and the food was quick i will most definitely not be returning to hurricanes. The menu was tiny and the food that we did order was so extremely subpar. The buffalo chicken dip was honestly the most disgusting I've ever had and the waffle fries it was served with were burnt to a crisp and tasted like they were fried, sat out for a few hours, fried again, sat out for awhile, and then served... i didn't think it was possible to ruin waffle fries but oh, you guys sure did. Please for the sake of everyone in Boston, take the buffalo chicken dip off your menu and never serve it to another human again. The pizza was also gross and not worth eating. I caught glimpse of other tables food and it all looked pretty much the same, inedible. If we weren't in a rush to get to the Celtics game we would have sent the food back but we had no time and the service was taking forever so we simply left a table full of inedible food and money for one of the worst meals I've had in awhile. 

With all the great places around the garden don't even waste your time here, even if it is for a short wait."
24,Hurricane's at the Garden,5 star rating,8/16/2019,Stopped while waiting for our train. Very friendly front door staff. Offered to hold my luggage for us while we sat down to enjoy a drink. Wait staff friendly. Great hard cider and beer selections
25,Hurricane's at the Garden,5 star rating,2/6/2018,"I went here for dinner and drinks before a Bruins game; a very busy time for Boston and the TD Garden area to say the least.  The gentleman at the door was very friendly!  They got us at a table by the bar within a couple minutes - it also helped we arrived around 5:30-6:00 PM before the rush - which I recommend!  I had a pepperoni pizza and my boyfriend had the pastrami sandwich which he has raves up and down about!  The pizza was OK.... I may try something different the next time.  Overall, good experience & good prices.  The bar ended up being packed with hockey fans within an hour - definitely a sign of a go-to spot.  

Waiter was awesome and on top of it, very efficient and friendly.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a quick bite and drinks before a game!"
26,Hurricane's at the Garden,4 star rating,5/9/2019,"great find! my boyfriend and i came in to hurricane's to watch the bruin's game. the restaurant resembles a ""Yardhouse"" or ""BJ's"" because it has a wide selection of food and drinks for reasonable prices. 

we had the plain & simple hot dog with waffle fries.. which are amazing! we had several drinks and were satisfied! 

the atmosphere is definitely worth it if there is a game going on at the same time!"
27,Hurricane's at the Garden,1 star rating,1/20/2019,"First , I really don't even should be giving this place a one star, lets start...the front guy is the most rude, un educated person I have ever encounter, this guy was so ignorant that he ask us for ID and we show him Puerto Rico driving license and said that it was not a valid ID that he need it a travel visa or passport.....hellooooo!! Puerto Rico is a territory of the US, and been a bar in Boston make it worst..I mean , really? Boston?....you really don't know how many Latinos live in Boston are you really so ignorant, not to mention that we even show him our military ID and to top things when we tried to educate this poor guy he made the comment "" that's why I don't drink"". This place show me the worst racist display a had ever seen , Hurricane Bar as a good advice hire more educated personnel."
28,Hurricane's at the Garden,1 star rating,12/31/2018,As a women do not go here. The manager is a horribly sexiest individual with zero respect for women. He was openly yelling at me in-front of my friends telling me to shut my mouth when I wasn't speaking. Absolutely a disgusting experience and will surely never return.
29,Hurricane's at the Garden,4 star rating,2/27/2019,"Hurricanes at the Garden is a great place to go if you want to cheer on the New York Jets while you are in Boston or if you want to grab some pre concert/sporting event drinks due to its proximity to the TD Garden. Most nights there are food and drink specials which consist of deals on cheap beers and appetizers. The food is quite good but a downside is that the ""good"" beers aren't discounted. I give this spot 4 stars because it's really good at a lot of things but they have competition from 5 star  spots right next to them like The Fours and Boston Beer Works which are better establishments."
30,Hurricane's at the Garden,4 star rating,3/1/2019,First time. Walked an hour and a half before Celtics game and a seat at bar opened up like a miracle. Friendly barkeep. Looking forward to pastrami sandwich.
31,Hurricane's at the Garden,5 star rating,7/27/2019,"I never EVER write reviews but I have the best time at Hurricanes whenever I go. The staff are great, the bartenders are knowledgeable and helpful. I never know what drink I'm in the mood for so they're always happy to make something up for me, which I LOVE! Also probably the only place in Boston without fruit flies right now, they really do a good job of keeping the bar clean. Definitely a bar you can spend the whole night in."
32,Hurricane's at the Garden,3 star rating,3/30/2019,"The only reason it got three stars is cause of the buff chick dip, the quesadilla was mediocre at best and the waffle fires were tasteless with cheese on top. And you can definitely based on how piping hot all the food was that they just microwave everything and nothing is made in house. Only reason I would come again is cause of how close it is to TD Garden and they have decent cocktails."
33,Hurricane's at the Garden,1 star rating,4/19/2019,"Worst service ever. Had someone called Beatriz. Me and my friend went in with the intention of getting plenty of drinks and food. Instead got a server who didn't want to be there, was rushing us and was just looking at us basically begging us to leave. We are not rude and i have never left a review before but had to come on here and explain how trash the service here is. Beatriz gave us the worst treatment anyone has ever given. Customers worst case could be switched to another server but we were met by rude trash service. Good food though and great drinks but the service makes the restaurant"
34,Hurricane's at the Garden,5 star rating,1/22/2018,"Stopped in before a Celtics game, had a great experience! I really love what they've done with the place, the decor and overall vibe is so much improved from what it was in the past. We ordered the buffalo chicken dip and a hot dog as we were just grabbing a quick bite. I'm pretty sure I'll only be eating buffalo chicken dip with waffle fries from now on. 

Plus - don't miss out on their nightlife! They have amazing live music every weekend, some of the best cover bands I've seen. Highly recommend this place!"
35,Hurricane's at the Garden,4 star rating,1/4/2019,"My boyfriend and I ate here before the Bruins game last night. We were seated very quickly and our server was attentive. I had the hummus appetizer for dinner and it was good but I wish that there was a bit more variety in the dipping options (Only celery, carrots and naan). My boyfriend has the clam chowder and the bacon cheeseburger. Both of which were good but nothing special. I would recommend this restaurant to others but the food is nothing special."
36,Hurricane's at the Garden,5 star rating,9/13/2019,"The best chicken tenders in the land!!!! Just got pink Whitney's, very exciting stuff. Denny is the best bartender."
37,Hurricane's at the Garden,5 star rating,3/7/2018,"Went to Hurricanes for the first time the other night! LOVE the vibe, food and service. It was so much fun. The live band was great and so was the show! There are three bars so there was never a long line for a drink! Lots of tables. Bathrooms were clean! Coat check in the front. Not sweaty and gross like other Boston bars. Might just be my new go-to!

Also all of the food was great...loved me some waffle fries!! Those pretzel bites are all I can dream about... might have to go back just for those and the heavenly cheese sauce with it"
38,Hurricane's at the Garden,3 star rating,9/7/2018,"This is a mediocre place. We went on a summer day, sat outside and had hummus platter and a turkey wrap. We had draft beer which hit the spot, and the outdoor seating was nice. The fries were good. The hummus was OK and overall just average place. What else? Not much else, and to the best of my knowledge, not many competitors near North Station! If you have to get something to eat in that neck of the woods, this is average but cannot evaluate vs other restaurants since I don't dine in that area very often."
39,Hurricane's at the Garden,5 star rating,11/4/2018,"Went here Halloween night after a concert around the corner and three of us bellied up to the bar. Christian, the restaurant manager, chatted with us about local craft beers and made us feel very welcomed ! The other bartenders were just as personable and friendly. We had dinner earlier that night elsewhere so we were only there for a few beers and I'm glad we ended up there. I'd recommend this place to anyone who was in the area looking for a fun bar and a great selection of some local beers."
0,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,10/24/2021,"Overall: nice ambiance for the evening, and good to try out but would try other options before a revisit 

Food: tasted good! But will say the price to quantity ratio was a bit high. Had to ask for extra salsa and chips as our table was 6 people and we needed more. Would recommend the chicken as a protein option

Service: ok. Asked to change tables but they could not as they were ""fully booked"" but tables were still empty by the time we left. Had to ask multiple times for some items but appreciated the extra chips and salsa. 

Other: stools/seating was not comfortable and no place for jackets/bags. Had my jacket and bag on the whole time"
1,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,3/19/2022,"VERY strict about their 90 minute limit, even though it wasn't stated when we made the reservation, and many tables were empty.

Literally wouldn't allow us to order another appatizer with '10 minutes left'

Food was good but they obviously had overbooked.  Have never been asked to leave a restaurant for staying too long after only an hour and a half..."
2,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,3/12/2022,"Bodega was a great time! Joe the bartender took really good care of me! Great hospitality and great service. I only had their carne asada tacos and wow! They weren't bad. I was a fan. Salsa was good. They reminded me of my parent's hometown tacos in San Luis Mexico. These type of tacos would be called Sonoran style. So the tacos taste reminded me of home. Only thing that bothered me was you had to order 3 tacos of the same style.  I want to be able to mix and match but apparently, they only do that on Tuesdays for $1 and $2 tacos. So I will be back on a Tuesday. Tortilla did taste a bit store bought tho. Overall it was a GREAT taco! I will also be back for their hot cheetos street corn. Also a very cute scenery. Would be a perfect place to take your date to. Place turns into a night club at night in the weekend. Will definitely be back."
3,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,2/22/2022,"Stopped in for a pregame bite. Was not disappointed. Atmosphere, music, service, food, drinks and prices were excellent. Our waitress, Julianna, was excellent, very attentive, friendly and professional. Made some awesome suggestions. Had the Tacos Tuesday Special. We ordered the fish, grilled avocado, carnitas, beef and cauliflower tacos. All a good size, fresh, tasty, well prepared and delicious. Drinks were also awesome. Definitely returning to try the other items on the menu."
4,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,2/20/2022,"The food and service was amazing! Didn't get a chance to take a picture of their corn appetizer but that's delicious too! And churros were fresh and mouthwatering, def recommend going here"
5,Bodega Canal,2 star rating,3/18/2022,"Great music, bouncers were nice, but this place deserves a 2-star review because of how rude our bartender was. I've never met anyone so rude, she was insulted because she didn't know how to make a ""bee's knees"" cocktail, a supposedly well-known cocktail. I didn't mind the fact that she did not know how to make it, but the way she reacted was very rude. She was also very rude and unwelcoming to my friends, which really ruined the whole vibe of the night. Her name is crystal, if you come to bodega stay away from this bartender. The bar back guy was amazing and super friendly, if I ever decide to come back I hope he's promoted to a bartender!"
6,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,9/4/2021,"Had an awesome dinner at bodega tonight! Been here before on Taco Tuesday and was somewhat disappointed but tonight's regular meal made up for its carne in our Baja bowls was perfectly cooked, taco shell on the salads was just right and we all left full. Service was awesome and so were the margs. Definitely will be back."
7,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,1/15/2021,"Hip fun place to go with a small group of friends. The drinks were good. House margaritas and I got a Paloma which is not on the menu but they were able to make for me. The waitress was nice and attentive. The sultry vibe of the place and the beat of the music make it a fun, social place to grab a drink and a bite to eat. 

The food was fresh and the portions were more than adequate. The house tortilla chips served with pico, a queso type dip and tomatillo salsa were good and a nice change from the traditional chips and salsa basket. 

For entrees - I really like the Baja bowl with carne. There was everything you could ask for in the bowl to make a hearty meal. The chicken fajitas was a marinated sliced chicken breast but the chicken was moist and flavorful. It came with the appropriate accompaniments. The only critique of the food is that the guacamole, tomatillo salsa and pico were way over over powered with lime juice. The level of acid was biting after a while leaving your mouth feel raw from the amount of acid.  Overall a good meal and a great experience."
8,Bodega Canal,2 star rating,2/12/2022,Food wasn't that great. Heard a lot of great things about the restaurant on tik tok but should have read the yelp reviews prior to coming. I agree with most of the reviewers that the food was bad. As someone who travels between Arizona and Boston a lot and has tried authentic Mexican food I can tell you this is not it. Dishes were very bland and lacked a lot of flavor. If you're looking for good vibes and fun atmosphere then you should stop by and get a few drinks but don't bother on the food.
9,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,2/6/2022,"I'll start with the positives, great ambiance and location! The hostess was also very accommodating to seating an extra person in my party who arrived late. They also offered complimentary shots for when the following party's reservation overlapped ours. I've had great dining experiences here in the past. 

It's possible they're understaffed or because our waitress knew a party of 6 meant an automatic 20% tip but the service was SEVERELY lacking. It was extremely difficult to order additional drinks or ask any questions after our meals were served. Someone in my party was also served her margarita in jagged BROKEN glass (half the glass edge was broken and sharp)  it was luckily noticed in time and no injury occurred. We brought it to the waitresses attention, she did bring out a replacement drink but the most disappointing part of this experience was when the check arrived we came to find she was still charged for the drink. 

Myself and the rest of my party will not be returning."
10,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,2/23/2022,"Great deal for taco Tuesday! I especially recommend the cauliflower tacos. Service was a bit slow but it's a fun vibe inside so we didn't mind! Very cool interior - loud music (there was a DJ), low lit, chandeliers."
11,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,2/19/2022,Bodega canal has the worst customer service of any restaurant in the Boston area. We showed up to our reservation 13 minutes late when the restaurant had converted into a bar and they stated that the kitchen was closed (which we were totally okay with) and that we'd have to pay cover (which we were also okay with) but they acted like they made us the biggest favor to let us in even though they take their last reservation at THE SAME TIME that their kitchen closes and somehow made this our fault!? Great atmosphere and music but they could really use some new bartenders and hostesses.
12,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,3/17/2022,"This is some of the best Mexican food I've ever had in Boston. The date night special is so cheap it can't be beat, but the quality of the food is amazing. Vinny was an amazing server and checked in on us so frequently. He deserves a promotion!"
13,Bodega Canal,2 star rating,10/30/2021,"I wanted to love this place but unfortunately the food was the worst Mexican I have had. The place was very dark and now I know why.....

We started with Chips and ordered guacamole. Added the street corn and wings for the appetizers. 

The wings were the smallest wings I had ever seen! This was my first time addressing food to the waitress and wanting to send something back! The manager told us there was a wing shortage .....and that's why they put 12 in the bowl instead of 8. The wings were half the size of my pinky finger to give you an idea. He said he would comp us the wings  

The street corn was cold when it came out and the corn was dry. It wasn't juicy kernels like corn should be. Could have been so much better if it was hot.  

Drinks: we all likes out drinks. Margaritas were fantastic.  Rose sangria was delicious. Cannot complain. 

Onto dinner: steak fajitas. The steak was medium rare as asked but it was so tough to bite when you made the taco. The other guests ordered fish tacos and shrimp tacos. Didn't hear them say much about it and they forgot to order beans and rice on the side which is an added up charge. 

Overall, disappointed in the restaurant and would not
Recommend. There has to be more authentic restaurants somewhere !"
14,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,8/30/2020,"Great place to eat and hang out. 

Food overall was excellent. Ordered the. Nachos Supreme to start which was phenomenal (see photo). Portions were huge and it was well done.

Then had the chicken fajitas which were good as well. Huge portion so didn't get to finish all of it.

Margarita was great and they have a massive tequila menu which you don't find often.

Overall great experience. Food great, outdoor seating, very friendly wait staff. One of the good eateries in the North End within a generally lively neighborhood.

If you're looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Boston deff come here!"
15,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,1/9/2022,"Made reservations for dinner but once we arrived, decided to just have a drink and leave. It was absolutely freezing inside. They didn't have a full bar and claimed it was because they were ""a tequila bar"". Bartenders were very nice and provided our drinks quickly."
16,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,6/12/2021,"Do NOT recommend. They think they are a club.m, wouldn't let me in with khaki shorts and as button up. 
Sorry, but you guys aren't a club. Try hards!"
17,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,8/3/2021,"Went here around 6:30pm on a Tuesday there weren't many guests. The service was good. The restaurant gives you complimentary chips and salsa which was good. The hot Cheetos street corn was delicious with a little bit of spice! I got a white wine sangria which was great as well. The only complaint we had were the tacos. We went on taco Tuesday so the prices for the tacos range from $1-$4 and I would not pay more than that for them. I got the chicken, carnitas, and short rib tacos. All of them were not great in flavor and really just okay. Some of the other food looked better so maybe skip the tacos."
18,Bodega Canal,2 star rating,1/28/2022,"I wish I had taken a pic of the soft tacos I ordered for a snack here. The tortillas was the size of a silver dollar. Okay, slight exaggeration. Be prepared to leave hungry or poor."
19,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,2/5/2022,This a joke of an establishment. How has someone not shut them down. The bouncers are rude. We waited 30 mins past our reservation time to be seated. Don't waste your money here
20,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,9/25/2019,"I have been a few times on the rare occasion I'm in the mood for cocktails. I tend to frequent other bars around the area just because the drinks here run about $14, but I always come back because they are good. I usually get the pineapple margarita which comes in a fun blue color, but my friend got the coconut margarita and man that looked delicious! Then again the frose also looks enticing...decisions, decisions.  There are plenty of drink options (especially for large groups), good food, and a great atmosphere. 

P.S. Seriously look into those large drinks to share, if my friends and I could settle on one drink I would order it."
21,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,8/31/2019,"Very surprised at how good the food was.  The best thing about this place is that chips are free!! It also came with 3 excellent sauces.  The chips are also unlimited refill.  We opted to order the Queso for extra.  The Queso had a weird texture and wasn't what we expected but wasn't terrible either.  Very mixed feelings about it; we just liked that it was warm.

There were 3 of us and we ordered the Shrimp Tacos and Pork Tacos to share (they came with 3 tacos each).  Loved both of the tacos.  They were stuffed with filling and left us feeling so full.  The sauces in each taco is unique and we all looked up with pleasantly surprised faces after our first bites of each.  The Shrimp one was my favorite!!  

I had no idea it turned into a nightclub later into the night but it's a great place to eat with a group of friends.  Very affordable prices and attracts nicely dressed, young crowds."
22,Bodega Canal,2 star rating,9/25/2021,"I was a loyal Bodega orderer, even if it were quite pricey because they had a really tasty keto bowl and generous nachos.  However last time we ordered from them all the food changed for the worse.

Keto bowl: the cauliflower (usually a highlight) was unseasoned (and thus unedible), the added steak meat was dry and they gave served 1/2 as much as usual, and the lettuce was replaced with iceberg
Nachos: reduced meat and no sides (e.g., guac)
Short Rib Quesadillas:  short rib was dry and tasted very different--not in a good way

Really disappointed that it seems Bodega either has a new chef or, what seems more likely, is taking significant efforts to reduce costs while keeping very high-end prices."
23,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,1/13/2022,"Great atmosphere, great drinks just the tables did not have much room at all to accommodate larger parties."
24,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,1/19/2021,"This is the spot. If you love high quality Mexican food in a sultry atmosphere with dope beats and awesome people, go. Now."
25,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,4/8/2019,"Bodega is now my favorite TACO TUESDAY SPOT. 

The tacos were so cheap & portions were so filling!! AND they give complimentary chips/salsa/hot sauces!

My taco rankings of the night would be:
1. Fish: bc who doesn't love fried fish with mango salsa!!
2. Adobo Chicken or Pork: tied because both were very good. I will add that the pork was a bit greasier/saltier though
3. Beef: could have gone without this one, it was just very basic and plain 

Tip: they also have other daily specials M-F (see photo) so I'll definitely be back to check those!"
26,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,11/28/2021,"Horrible establishment, i brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. He has never been here but i have been here a couple times and enjoyed the music. The bouncer for the lounge area wouldn't let us go to the other side of the bar apparently because its only for people who have bought tables but i call BS because Ive been on the other side. Talked to the bartender and she just told me to wait, we waited roughly an hour and i talked to another bartender to understand whats going on. Ive seen him let in other girls and at this point I'm feeling like we ate being discriminated against. So since i asked the bartender how can we get into the other side, that pissed off the bouncer and he quote on quote told me "" its not gonna happen, you asked two of the bartenders and you don't tell me how to do my job"" so im shocked at this point at how rude he was. I immediately found the manager and he apologized and walked me and my bf and friends over to the other side through the back door. At this point it hits midnight and me and my friends are all having the time of our lives ( we have probably been there for like 30 mins) . It legit hit 12am on the dot and it was my bfs birthday and the manager came over and said his bouncer told him i was harassing him so now he has to kick us all out. Weird. Im shocked at this point beyond belief. I told him that never happened and he Didnt believe me. The manager needs to hire better employees and listen to his actual customers. The bouncer came over specifically to look for us and kick us out. On the way out he grabs my drink out of my hand and crushes it like the hulk. No words. It was the most embarrassing and horrible experience Ive ever had. I just feel so bad for my bf and my friends because we all came out to have a good time. To be honest i believe we were being discriminated against because we were all ethnic. I hate this racist shithole. Never will come here or recommend anyone to come here for nightlife. You guys can suck one."
27,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,6/12/2021,"If anyone in your party is wearing shorts, they won't let you in.

Not that fun of a bar to have this kind of policy

Bouncers look homeless too, such a confusing dynamic"
28,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,6/19/2020,"Our first time here, and it's in the midst of COVID-era outdoor seating. What I highly recommend: the nacho cheese dip-- wow-- the grilled avo tacos-- wow-- and the house margarita. The strawberry margarita was a fave of my dining companion but I found it too sweet. The fish tacos were good but nothing to write home about (I might have been too full from the dip and guac), and the guac is great too. Although there is no one dining inside (obvi), there is loud club music that made me wish clubs weren't such a thing of the distant past and distant future. The service was very attentive. Overall we had a great experience here and can't wait to come back."
29,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,2/8/2020,"I love Mexican food and really want to find a good place here in Boston, however this place fell flat.

We got chips and dip right away so I had high hopes. You get 3 different dips which was a nice variety. However, things went downhill when we ordered. 

The server misunderstood my friend who wanted carnitas tacos and not empanadas.  Another server brought out the empanadas which we said was not the order. He walked away with them briefly and then came back and said they were on the house so I took one.  Our other server came back looking annoyed, saying the erroneous empanadas were actually not on the house. Instead of apologizing for misunderstanding my friend, she stood over her and informed her she ordered the empanadas. They did agree to fix her order but thought this was all extremely rude.  We were not charged for the empanadas but she was sure to take them off the table. 

I got the carne asadas which were spicy but overall something I could have made at home.  $17 for 3 average tacos with no sides is a ripoff. 

The only saving graces of this place were the drinks and the guacamole. I got the rose sangria which was very strong and I thought the guacamole was prepared just right. The portion size was generous and the 3 of us did not finish it. 

If you want to be served drinks and guacamole with attitude this might be the place for you but I will likely not be back."
30,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,5/30/2021,"Just okay. Definitely not Mexican food. Also not great food in general. We left our leftovers behind. Super slow service even when the place was basically empty. They do have cheaper beers than places in the area, though."
31,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,2/5/2022,"we waited over 30 minutes for our dinner reservation made at 8:30, we were seated at 9:10. the food was fine, we stayed until it opened to night life. four of our friends were let into the back nightlife section, the rest of us right behind them, and they turned us away. because""we weren't on the list"" our friends that they let in also were not in the list. the staff is rude. there are a million other places in boston to go that are better than this, no matter how ""popular"" people say."
32,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,10/1/2021,Make you pay $20 cover and don't even let you onto the dance floor. It's an absolute scam!!!!
33,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,2/3/2020,"Cozy place! Decent food, overall pretty big portions.  I would say it's a good place to feel boujee while not spending too much money but also not  getting the best Mexican food out thEre. My friends got the Baka boWl which was huge, and they addEd chicken, which they said was dry. I got the cauliflower tacos which were quite good although it could hAve used more seasoning, and the hot sauces they did have were very hard to get out the bottle.. also a shame that you can't get a single ttaco or mix and match, you can only get plates of 3 tacos, which I think gets kind of boring. The raspberry sanGri was mOre juice than anything else.. the staff was friensly and it was a cool atmosphere but wouldn't go back for the food alone."
34,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,2/12/2021,Bad food. Drinks couldn't tell you because they declined three of my friends ids who are over 21 because they don't accept puerto ricans ids. Even tough it is a US government issued id. If that doesn't scream discrimination I don't know what does. Also seating was uncomfortable almost half of our table was in stools
35,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,9/26/2020,Awesome margaritas. The coconut in particular is phenomenal. The passion fruit and house margarita are also very good. In terms of food...really enjoyed their guac. We both had baja bowls with small substitutions that they were happy to work with. Love that they have cauliflower rice on the menu. I subbed it out for a nice filling veggie dish. Would absolutely return and want to try some tacos next time.
36,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,10/16/2021,"This is a drinks only spot! Margaritas were good and they had plenty of options. However, this is probably the worst Mexican food in Boston. The salsa was complimentary but tasked like vinegar, guacamole had too much lime, and tacos were unimpressive. I could have looked past this but the service was terrible. We were not checked on for 30 minutes after we received our food and were one of the only tables seated at the restaurant. We waited for 30 minutes, hoping to order another drink, while watching our server chat it up at the bar with the other workers. We tried to get his attention by waving several times but the water cooler gossip must have been hot. If you are looking for good Mexican, I would recommend Lolita."
37,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,8/26/2020,"First time at their venue. Ambience was great and casual dining. If you want to spice up your life, I recommend the spicy cucumber margarita.

When you're tired of having Italian all the time, the next around the rotation is Mexican. Bodega Canal is tacos. Lots of tacos. Sure, there's other stuff but... tacos.

They have the usual pulled chicken or pork, but then there's mushroom and al pastor and ground beef and duck confit and even octopus! I ended up doing a surf and surf and turf, ordering one fish, one shrimp and one skirt steak.

Service was excellent. John was friendly and understanding of the give and take here."
39,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,6/26/2018,"I would definitely come here for drinks, but not for food. The margaritas were tasty and very potent, and the spicy margarita has a very defined kick.

 The food was good, but not amazing enough to warrant the price to portion ratio. The fajitas are definitely the way to go (both shrimp and beef looked amazing), but the tacos (we got scallop ceviche and carne asada) were teeny and not that great. 

The tropical guac appetizer was very tasty, as were the tequila wings. The service was blazingly fast and efficient."
40,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,9/4/2021,"This was a horrible experience. I went here for my friends 22nd and Where. Do. I. Begin. They took 20 minutes to check 5 IDs and when we ordered chips we told the server we had a chickpea allergy at the table for 2 PEOPLE! When they come back, they bring out a plate with chips, Guac, 2 types of salsa... AND HUMMUS!! They asked us what allergies we had and we told them yet they still brought out hummus that was supposed to be on ""next weeks"" menu.... They were so rude to us and didn't care that my friends could have died. They also didn't give my friend the birthday school birthday Shots because someone wasn't 21... how does that make sense. No one go here unless you want to be disappointed and disgusted. They deserve 0 stars so I don't know what this 1 star business is"
41,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,7/29/2021,this is by far the worst place to go in boston. the female bartender was rude and bad mouthed everyone from servers to the guests at her bar. the hostess had to be woken up from her phone to say hi and everyone behind the bar were too busy to help guests and make money because every one of them including the barback were on there phones. dont entertain this restaurant or the staff because its clear they dont care about anything but themselves
42,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,7/3/2021,HORRIBLE experience. Literally SO dirty. Saw a rat! Don't even get me started on the management. Whoever the guy with the mustache was is SO rude and needs to be reevaluated because he is not fit to be in the service industry. Definitely one of the most horrible experiences in Boston.
43,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,3/27/2021,"DO NOT GO TO BODEGA CANAL! we paid $8 for queso that did not even come with chips! Are they expecting me to drink the queso? The food was okay but the customer service was AWFUL!  After our hour and a half time limit was up, we were ordering out Ubers and standing outside. A manager came up and yelled at us to move away from the entrance. We ordered the uber to the restaurant, we couldn't just walk away from the location! The waiter was not friendly and seemed like it was a chore to come back to get our order because we didnt want to order right away.  I get that Saturday nights are busy, but if you can't be nice to your customers during a dinner rush, then consider opening a lunch place instead."
44,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,6/12/2021,"This place turned me down last night calling my khaki shorts ""gym attire"". I would love to know who wears khaki shorts to the gym. It is a little funny that they try to be all restrictive with a dress code like they're some exclusive club and not some rinky dink bar in Boston.  I gladly took my business to one of the other bars around the area and I suggest everyone else should follow suit. Friends who ended up getting in and paying the $10 cover said it was very disappointing and not worth the cover and hassle."
45,Bodega Canal,2 star rating,3/27/2019,"Came here for a girls night on Taco Tuesday. They have specials for $1, $2, and $4 tacos every Tuesday. When we went the specials were for a $1 beef taco, $2 jerk chicken taco, pulled pork taco, and fish taco and then $4 for their avocado taco.

The ambiance is very good here. On the night we went the DJ was fantastic - we were vibing to all the songs played.

Our server was friendly and answered all of our questions. About halfway through our meal he disappeared though (he went outside with about half the staff - maybe just his break?) so it took awhile to get the check. The girl who brought us the food was not as friendly and stood awkwardly over our table until one of us noticed her and then just handed us the plates instead of putting them on the table herself. She also failed to clear any of the appetizer plates, so everything was super crowded. We ended up clearing it ourselves...

As for the food, I've had way better tacos. The jerk chicken taco had absolutely no jerk flavoring on it whatsoever. We were a group of Caribbean girls, so we know how jerk is supposed to taste; this was not it. The beef taco was dry; we ended up asking for salsa and sour cream just to spice it up ourselves. The pulled pork taco had Doritos on it, which was kind of weird and unnecessary. The fish taco was probably the best of the ones we ordered; well battered but wasn't a huge fan of the mango salsa that came with it. I prefer my fish tacos with cabbage. 

For appetizers, we had the shrimp, which was good. The empanadas I would skip. Wings were pretty good, too. 

The drinks are the only reason I would come back. Margs were strong, but wish they had salted our rims.

Overall, not at all impressed. Was expecting a lot more."
46,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,2/25/2021,"This place had incredible quesadillas and margaritas. However, they added an automatic 20% tip on to our bill and said nothing to us. After working in the restaurant industry for years, I know that waiters are required to tell guests about the tip added. We called the restaurant to get our money back and they said it was too late because the waitress had already been paid. If a restaurant wants to charge an automatic gratuity, it's perfectly within its right to do so. However, the restaurant does not have the right to deceive its customers, so any agreement must be fully transparent and readily understandable. Go to Bodega Canal if you want to be deceived, go literally anywhere else if you don't."
47,Bodega Canal,2 star rating,9/25/2019,"If you're thinking of coming here for dinner, save yourself a lot of frustration and head to Chipotle instead--both the service and the food will be better than at Bodega Canal. 

This place is can only be recommended for Friday and Saturday late nights when it's a bar, out as it was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in a while. 

The food:
Came for taco Tuesday and got guac + mix of chicken and fish tacos with a side of rice. The chicken was drier than the Sahara desert, which is impressive considering that it's marinated. The flavors in the fish tacos rendered them nearly inedible (Moctezuma is rolling over in his grave due to this place serving fish tacos in flour tortillas with some bizarre mango salsa). Finally, the side of rice, which arrived ~10 minutes after the rest of the food when our meal was nearly over, looked and tasted as though it had been scraped out of the bottom of the yesterday's pot. The only tasty part of our meal was the guac--it was tangy and the chips were well salted. 

The drinks:
It took over 20 minutes to get a pitcher of house margaritas. The drinks arrived ~5 minutes AFTER our food had been placed on the table. The margaritas were extra regular and the pitcher was small for $50. 

The service:
The waitress was abhorrent. She was no where to be found to check in on the status of our long-lost margaritas and was not apologetic when they were delivered late. Same situation of her not being around to ask about the missing rice; she did rectify the rice debacle by removing it from the bill (same can't be said for the margaritas...). Interestingly, when it came time to begin clearing plates and leave the check, she was very attentive and kept coming over to our table when at that point we just wanted to be left alone to chat. 

The takeaway:
Save your money and skip this place. For upscale Mexican in Boston, head to Lolita's instead--better food, way better drinks, and better vibes."
48,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,3/8/2020,"Came here for dancing, so I can't speak to the food, but my friends and I had so much fun here! We came for dancing on a Saturday night and waited in line for around 10-15 minutes before getting in. The drinks at the bar were pricey, but not far from what you'd expect at a club, so brace yourself or drink at home before. The music was AWESOME--super fun to dance to, mainstream enough that the songs were recognizable, but not just Top 40 replays--and around 12:30, it went full reggaeton, which my friend and I love. We stayed for a long time and danced a while. Bathrooms were pretty clean and the line for it moved quickly. One thing I appreciated a lot was that groups kept to themselves--we didn't run into any uncomfortable encounters or strangers trying to approach us. The overall good vibe and killer music made this a highlight of the weekend."
49,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,11/17/2020,Food was great - the decor is great and makes you feel like you are in South America enjoying the life. The spicy margarita hits the spot. They have a all you can eat night which I love but you can sub for different meats. The staff - not super friendly and leave you wanting more hospitality.  BUT that drink will def have me return for a 2nd chance lol
50,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,11/17/2020,One of my favorite spots in Boston. The food is great and I love the Taco Tuesday's. Also a great spot for Nightlife/Clubs as well.  The Staff is fantastic. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice spot to eat and chill.
51,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,3/7/2020,"You need to fire the front girl who ripped us off with the cover charge on Friday night. We were on the guestlist (and we could clearly see it on her phone) yet she kept demanding a part of our group to pay a higher cover. She was rude and ignored any reasoning. Let's hope karma returns you the favor.

Bad first impression of the place."
52,Bodega Canal,2 star rating,1/16/2020,"I was really excited about going to Bodega Canal cause I've heard such great things - unfortunately I was extremely underwhelmed when I went to a group dinner (3 of us) last night. 

I will start with the pros: 
The Rose sangria is a must. So delicious. 
According to my friends - the salmon tacos were amazing. 
Atmosphere is very cool. I'm sure it is awesome during the weekend.

On to the cons: 
1. Service - awful. If there are only two tables in the restaurant - there is no reason for diners to have to flag down their servers. There is no reason for dirty plates to be left on the table while you walk back & forth to go talk to the hostess. I used to be a server & that did not fly where I worked. (Before anyone gets on me - I still tipped 20% because everyone needs to make a living but it still isn't right) If I'm paying $16 for tacos (mine weren't that great, I got the carnitas) the least you can do is check in on our table every so often. 

2. My plate - Carnitas tacos. They were pretty bland - nothing special about them. I definitely expected more & their house hot sauces also underwhelming .. not to mention they were super crusty and I could barely get the hot sauce out? Kind of gross but it is what it is. 

For a $170 meal I expected more but again, it is what it is. Definitely will not be going back I'll spend my money at Guy Fieri's"
53,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,9/8/2020,"We had a nice meal at Bodega Canal. We started with the nacho cheese dip, which we should have skipped. For $8 you get a tiny (!) bowl of nacho cheese that tastes exactly like the stuff you get up the street at the Garden. The dips that come with the chips & salsa are WAY better. We ordered red sangria & a coconut margarita, which were both very good. For our mains we had the chicken fajitas and baja bowl with carne, they were both delicious and big portions. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. Overall we'll be back, but we'll skip the nacho cheese next time."
54,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,1/8/2020,"Went here for the first time with a friend as it was really convenient to North Station.  I'd say it was a bit of xx a mixed bag.  Our server was great, super nice.  

The drinks were really good.  I had the Despacito and my friend had an old fashioned with mezcal, I forget the name. The chips with sauces that came out were really good. 

For starters we got buttermilk friend shrimp and empanadas. The shrimp was really not good. It was soggy, and the shrimp tasted like it was frozen and defrosted in a not good way. I didn't care for the empanada but my friend liked it. 

For mains I got the fish taco and a cauliflower taco, it was taco Tuesday so you could order different tacos. I thought they both pretty good. My friend had the short rib quesadilla, and was also good.  

There are better options s for this type of food, so not sure I'm dying to go back. But the location is really good so maybe when I'm back in the area. 

Also, as a weird side note, I spent a fair bit of time at The Grand Canal back in the day, so walking in brought back some funny memories."
55,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,5/31/2019,"Not sure the reason for so many middle of the road reviews, I've always had a good experience here and I go a lot. The drinks are good, the margarita selection is solid. And if you are looking to pay a lot you can get a large format in a piñata glass. 

My favorite two things on the menu are the burrito and burrito bowl, both I think are best with carney. Chips are also good and staff is generally friendly!"
56,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,5/25/2019,"This review is only for the club, not the food! I came here to celebrate my friends 30th birthday last friday night. She reserved a table which was key because the lounge area was pretty small and packed. I never go out in Boston anymore because the music is always whack, but the Bodega jams were ON POINTTTT. So much amazing hip hop and really fun vibes. The other side of the bar was also pretty empty so we went and hung out over there for a bit too. It was a lot of fun. I'll definitely return."
57,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,8/3/2019,"Went out with a large group tonight-- This employee at Bodega whose name is Christian apparently needs to brush up on fire codes if he ever wants to stop me or any other woman from leaving this place ever again. He literally stood with his body guarding the door and refused to let me out when my uber was outside even though he had let other people out SECONDS BEFORE ME. Clearly he's got issues, but also-- ITS AN EXIT! So if I want to leave, I'm using the door that says EXIT above it. He also said he would fight me if I left and used his arms to block the door which is definitely not his purpose as a ""security"" guard. Waste of space and waste of payroll. Also a safety hazard if he's blocking people inside when the capacity at this place is 100% over what it should be and everyone's stepping on people because it's over crowded."
58,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,3/5/2021,This is definitely the worst experience I've had in Boston. There is no sense of hospitality here. The waitresses and the manager give the worst attitudes and are not attentive to any customer. I have recently gone three times to this place and had consecutive bad experiences. The food was mediocre at best and service was slow. The drinks were extremely watered down and not worth the price we paid.
59,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,7/31/2018,"Came here with my girlfriend on recommendation by our friends and on reading some reviews.

Atmosphere - The ambiance is great with almost a speakeasy vibe to it. The lights are dim with candles lit throughout the restaurant. The restaurant has an open space with a balcony and an open floor for seating.

Food - For starters, we got the Street Corn. It was probably the best thing we got here besides the drinks. It was packed with flavor and paired very well with our margaritas. As for our entrees, we got the Shrimp and Steak Fajitas. Both dishes were very bland and we thought they were lacking a lot of flavor and crunch. The shrimp was too watery to hold any of the seasoning. 

Service - Attention from the staff was on point and they came to us frequently to ask us how we were doing and if we needed anything. Even though we came without a reservation at peak dinner time, we were immediately seated by the hostess. All our drinks and food came in an orderly fashion with barely any delays. 

Overall, I would come by this place for drinks and perhaps appetizers, but I would recommend going elsewhere for food."
60,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,6/20/2018,"Great ambience and nice food. Dont forget to order the chips with 3 salsas. There is one salsa that looks like queso but its actually hot yellow pepper salsa with a creamy texture and its amazing! The margaritas were good, but didnt make sense to order a pitcher as it was $40 and served a little less than 4 glasses. Each individual glass of margarita is $10 so youre better off getting your own glasses. Shrimp fajitas were nice, surprisingly good quantity of shrimps."
61,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,10/15/2020,"Eating at this restaurant was the worst dining experience of my life. From the moment my party walked through the doors the entire staff, manager included, was rude, harassing and discriminatory. 

We were a group of 5 coming in to celebrate a 26th birthday with cocktails before dinner (which was at another restaurant in another part of the city.) After seeing rave reviews on Instagram and TikTok we were all elated to try to place out ourselves. Upon reservation the restaurant required a per person fee to sit us under a mediocre neon sign at an otherwise nondescript table. After ordering drinks, my friend was repeatedly targeted by our server and yelled at for resting her foot on the *leg* of the table. Instead of politely asking her to keep both feet on the ground (and really, why is this even an issue??) she was yelled at. In addition, despite having reservations elsewhere in the city for dinner immediately after our Bodega reservations, the manager approached our table and screamed at us for heaving he audacity to ""plan to stay all night."" No such claim was ever made by anyone in our party yet the manager was irate from the get-go. I have never been treated in such a demeaning way in my entire life. 

As a group of predominantly non-white individuals it is hard to see this kind of maniacal behavior as anything other than discrimination. We ended up leaving three untouched pitchers of margaritas on the table, being charged $160 for them and the manager went back to schmoozing it up with his friends at a nearby table. 

Unless you have some sadistic desire to be treated like dog poo and made to feel like you're unwanted and otherwise unwelcome at this establishment, I'd recommend avoiding this restaurant like we all avoided COVID-19 in March. I'd be the first to admit if my group was being loud, audacious, or obnoxious and I can swear, hand on the Bible, this was not the case."
62,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,9/30/2018,"Food was ok. Empanadas were a little slimy. Patatas Bravas were good.
Drinks were probably the best part. 
And our waitress was friendly and attentive.
Three stars because I didn't see anything worth 4 or 5. Food wasn't impressive or flavorful for a Mexican restaurant"
63,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,3/3/2021,"Me and my friends had one of the worst customer service experiences of our lives. We are all 21+ by multiple years and the manager, Krista, insisted that the majority of our IDs didn't scan. After asking her to rescan and having her say to us in the rudest tone that they are fake IDs and she will not accept them, they scanned confirming we were all over 21. She insisted we were wrong and wasn't even kind for a second. One of the rudest waitresses/managers I've ever had at any place. Her name is Krista (Christa?) and I hope she doesn't act this way towards future customers. She ruined our friend's birthday."
64,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,3/20/2021,"Our waitress was very rude and neglected to inform us that the gratuity was included- she was very short, refused to serve us drinks we requested and when we saw on the receipt that we had accidentally tipped 15% on top of the 20% gratuity and asked to get our receipt to fax that she took a very long time and was very unpleasant throughout the entire ordeal"
65,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,9/21/2018,"Good drink selection, decent food, nice ambiance at Bodega.

Ambiance- Bodega is dimly candlelit with a sprinkle of chandeliers, graffiti-ed concrete walls, floral upholstered booths, and black tables. The bar along the back of the restaurant takes up a large space, highlighting the cocktails on the menu.

Food- Mainly tacos, a few entrees, and some appetizers featuring your typical Mexican fair. All the tacos are petite, one tortilla, and several toppings, pay per taco kind of deal. I wasn't impressed the carne asada, chewy bites of steak a bit overly cooked. The carnitas is a bit better, juicy braised pork and pickled red onions. The veggie option is a bit boring- squash with a bit of cotija cheese on top. The chips with salsa was nothing special. The red salsa tasted like sweet tomato sauce, the pico tasted like it came out of a jar, the tomatilla and guac were much better.

Cocktail menu is the highlight here! I chose the strawberry mezcal margarita-super smoky, fruity strawberry but not too sweet, rounded out with a salty rim.

The service here was friendly overall. I received one of my tacos incorrectly and the server quickly replaced it. As others say here, I would go for the drinks but the food not so much."
66,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,3/8/2018,"I'm surprised i didn't run into Gronk here because this place sure knows how to ¡FIESTA! I booked an area of the lounge for my girlfriend's 25th birthday party and it couldn't of been more accommodating to our birthday girl's needs. It was risky on my end, a new restaurant and lounge wasn't sure how it'd work out but in the end our expectations were blown out of the water. 

The service and staff were efficient and friendly, the drinks and food were delicious, the atmosphere and music were intimate and groovy, and the decor really put this place over the top. On top of that, they brought out a cake for the birthday girl and we all sang happy birthday. 

This is a hidden gem for now, so get in while ya can!"
67,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,2/19/2021,The service at this restaurant was HORRIBLE. They were blatantly rude. Would not recommend going unless you go for all you can eat tacos and eat your money's worth to forget the rudeness.
68,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,7/11/2018,"Drinks are AWESOME! Order the coconut marg, cucumber/jalapeño marg is also great although I didn't really taste the cucumber. 

To share, skip the guacamole and 3 salsas (nothing exciting), coconut shrimp was delicious! Fish taco was also good but nothing remarkable. 

The churros though!! The plain come with a very rich chocolate but if you're not in to that they're so many other options. Oreo was by far my favorite but fruit loop was also great. 

Atmosphere was amazing and our waitress was the best! 10/10 would eat here again!"
69,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,11/30/2017,"Huge fan of their sister restaurant (North Square Oyster) so I couldn't wait to try Bodega! The décor is great - lots of chandeliers and dimmed lights make for a great atmosphere for date night or drinks with the gals. The space is 3 floors with seating on each. We were sat upstairs at a table near the fireplace (which I think is just for looks). Our waiter Jeff was SO helpful and really made our experience great. 

Must Try:
Jalapeno/Cucumber Margarita: so fresh with a hint of spice, I had two!
Street Corn: small portion but bursting with perfectly charred flavors. 
BUTTERED LOBSTER TACOS: the star of the show. order them, love them, thank me later. 

Also great: 
Al Pastor tacos: hefty scoop of pork with grilled pineapple, this was first runner up to the lobster tacos. 
Carne Asada Tacos: can you really go wrong here? No - and Bodega hit the nail on the head again. 

The only thing I didn't like is that there aren't any options for sides (rice, beans, etc.) and there also is no dessert menu (churros would be the perfect addition to the menu!!!). The place is still brand new, so I am hoping these options are added on as time goes on. Bottom line, go to Bodega - I promise you will love it!"
70,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,1/8/2018,"I was not very impressed with Bodega. I was excited to try it as it's relatively new, but I was a little underwhelmed. The guacamole was pretty average, nothing to write home about- but I have heard the queso is amazing. 
I ordered the carne asada tacos, which usually you can't go wrong with. The flavor was great and the fried onion straws were an awesome crunchy compliment to the meat. However, they were SO greasy!! I could not believe how much oil there was, the tacos were literally SWIMMING which made them very difficult to eat. On a good note, the Mexican street corn is to die for and i would highly recommend that!! 
The cucumber jalapeño margarita was strong in regards to tequila and flavor- definitely recommend for those who like a little kick in their drinks. The margaritas are awesome, but I wish the food was consistently as good."
71,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,1/16/2018,"Five stars for Mexican food in Boston (not sure I would give it this outside of New England, but hey, here we are)

I've been twice; first trip there were a few hiccups like slow service and some of our chips were a bit stale. However, their street corn, cocktails and ambiance were good enough to bring me back.

On my second visit, it seemed like they had ironed out some of the kinks. We walked right in on an (albeit rainy) Friday night at peak dinner hours and were seated immediately which was great. As mentioned before, the interior ambiance is very hip, and is also very large so you don't feel cramped. This time, our chips were fresh (still warm!) and crispy with the right amount of salt, and the guac was on point. Cocktails (a variety of margaritas this time) and street corn were once again delicious and this time we got 3 different kinds of tacos, all of which were great. Our waitress was attentive and friendly without hovering and we didn't wait long for anything.

All in all, I'll definitely be back! Really happy to have this place close to home, especially as someone from the West where good Mexican food is a standard (one that is lacking in Boston IMO). I hope my experiences continue to be as good as my last one at Bodega Canal, I'm looking forward to my next visit, hopefully soon!"
72,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,3/26/2018,"My first time at this place! My bf stoped by to say hi to his friend who's working at this place as a bartender. So I just tagged along. We parked at the streets and we started looking at where the place was. At first we thought it was already close since we passed by the other half. Good thing it was just one of the side of the place. 
When we went inside it's like a little bit gothic with a lot of candles everywhere. It's kind of like Lolita's but with less red inside lol. And there's so much more space in there and the area is bigger as well. 
He hooked us up with some margaritas I got the peach margarita and my bf got the regular one. My drink was pretty good! I loved it! 
We only got one drink and we had to go cause I have a final essay due by midnight. So that sucks for me! 
Either ways. Would love to come back next time when I'm not running out of time to do some essay writing in the future!"

Always checking in on us during dinner to make sure we are all good. The food is amazing. The strawberry margaritas are my absolute favorite. No better way to end the night then with some churros. Even with these challenging times, covid protocols were followed by everyone and you feel comfortable being there. I have NEVER  had a bad experience here and will continue going back."
75,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,4/27/2018,"Decent ambiance - rustic yet contemporary- it's co

Service - perfect

Food 

chips and salsa very mediocre 

Taco is great - you can see how I'm saying taco instead of plural tacoS - it's expensive for just one taco- usually for $8-10 you get a plate of 3 tacos - this place does one taco ! 

Cocktails r great - it has a great spicy cucumber margarita and Paloma was very good as well! 

Overall, would be a great cocktail bar but for food the salsa needs to step up its flavors and taco prices need to be lowered for the quantity !"
76,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,1/17/2021,"I have NEVER been treated so poorly at a restaurant in my life. The staff was condescending, rude, and clearly unequipped to serve alcohol. 

It started because my two friends and I had out of state IDs (Virginia, Colorado, Washington). Our server told us she had to go ask her manager if she was allowed to serve us, because she didn't know if Bodega Canal could serve people without Mass IDs. Sure, fine. When she came back, she tossed our cards back on the table and said she couldn't accept them. When we asked why, she said ""Oh, because they're fake"". This was obviously not true, so we asked to speak with her manager. She told us he was just going to say the same thing she said, but we asked to speak with him anyway. He ended up denying that he said they were fake, and instead claimed that he couldn't serve us because he had LOOKED UP our FACEBOOK PAGES and couldn't find anything. He claimed it was so he could look for graduation photos with dates on them. Which-- what?? We pulled up our Facebook pages and showed him the pictures ourselves. He then claimed it wasn't enough-- which, if our Facebook photos aren't enough, why was he looking for them in the first place?? We then pulled out all the backup identification we had-- insurance cards, credit and debit cards, student IDs. He said it wasn't enough because he still didn't like ""the look"" of our IDs-- especially the one from Washington. He said it looked ""too thick"". Maybe using google wasn't part of his management training, but I suggest he tries it next time. There are lots of resources that will tell you exactly what a Washington ID looks like, and they're all free!
After more haggling on our end, he said the best he could do was send pictures of our licenses and our credit cards to the owner of the restaurant to ask for permission to serve us. He did not do this in front of us, so for all we know they now have our credit card and drivers license information stored somewhere. We also didn't see him delete the photos.

While he was gone our server came back. She said that the reason they were being so strict is because they had gotten shut down and fined a few months ago for serving underage students. This is something that is absolutely NOT our problem. In the future, here are some solutions to getting shut down for serving underage students: train your staff better, get a reference book on drivers licenses by state, get a scanner that tells you if an ID is real. Here are some things you should not do: Harass your customers. Our server also tried to claim that it was Massachusetts state law that you had to get a Mass drivers license within a year of living in-state (absolutely NOT true), and so it was our fault for not having the right IDs to begin with. 

The manager finally comes back (it's been like, 45 minutes of us trying to get served at this point), and just says, ""ok. we can serve you"". We asked to switch servers, and so the bartended ended up taking our orders. I think his name was Kyle, and he was the only lovely part of our evening. Huge shoutout to Kyle.

All this to say, we will never return to Bodega Canal, and I suggest you don't either. We're all college students, and we're very used to Boston's strict rules about drinking, but this was just insane. I wish they had advertised on their website that they didn't have the capability to serve people from out of state, because then we would not have wasted out time.

To the Bodega Canal management: I recommend getting a reference book on drivers licenses. It's only 25 dollars on Amazon. I'll send it to you myself if it means nobody else has to get harassed by your staff."
77,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,11/22/2017,"I was enthused to check the place out, knowing the owners other restaurants and always looking for a great Mexican spot near the north end.

Cucumber Jalapeno Margarita was good, but the food was pretty mediocre. First off they charge for chips and salsa... that's pretty rare for a mexican restaurant even in Boston. I would have no problem with the cost (minimal cost) however they were not good. Salsa was just pulverized clearly made in house, a little on the acidic side and the chips were extremely thin with a sheen of oil (90% of the chips weren't even salted). My chips broke just trying to eat the salsa, most of the chips were almost translucent. We also ordered the street corn which was overcooked (corn was a gummy texture). Luckily the tacos we ordered sort of made up for the terrible appetizers  (cheeseburger tacos, and buttered lobster). Those were pretty good, definitely different takes on tacos but I think overall they need to work on their food & menu.

I will give them that it was day 2 after their official opening (but they were already out of queso) so I will probably give them another try at some point however this place left a lot to be desired."
78,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,2/28/2021,"Never have I ever had such an unwelcoming and bad experience at a restaurant in Boston before. I was super excited to try Bodega Canal as my friend and I try a New Mexican spot like 1-2 a month in Boston trying to find our favorites and this one came highly rated and recommended.Our server was completely uninterested and frankly so rude to my table. My friend ordered a margarita and I forgetting my ID proceeded to ask her about any mocktail options ... before I could even mutter out a sentence she said ""I'll just get you a water"" and sped away. Few minutes later she comes back and slams my water cup down spilling it on my and my phone and does not even apologize ... even as she sees me frantically wiping down my phone and shirt. She asks what we wanted ... we asked for guac to start. We got our complementary salas and after 10 minutes no guac ... when I finally got sigh of our waitress I said ""oh we ordered guac just wondering when it would be coming out"" to which she responded ""oh you want to order guac?"" And ran away ... again ... although we had already ordered the guac. She came back for our order and her body language and energy just made me feel truthfully so terrible ... she made us feel so unwelcome as she asked for our order so quickly and angrily and again would speed away before we could even think about what we had ordered.Throughout the rest of the service she would come slam plates down and pick them up and it was just awful. She didn't even bring my friend a water cup. When we were done ( which was fairly quick bc she wanted to get the hell out) she literally snatched my napkin out from under my arm as sheangrily grabbed our plates. We were out of there in about 35 minutes bc we could not stand to be in there any longer !!!! The food was okay overall... nothing that special but It didn't even matter bc of how bad the service was ... I am so extremely disappointed and will never be back!!!!"
79,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,3/13/2020,"This place sucks SO BAD DO NOT GO HERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. I had an extremely sub par and over priced meal--honestly gag worthy but I spent around 80$ for one taco because I had to keep ordering margarita pitchers so that I could actually finish my meal. The worst part? After our meal my friends and I went to the club portion to have one drink at 1030 pm. The club was completely empty except for us. I set my jacket down at one of the tables and looked over 30 minutes later and someone had put it in the trash can. There was no one in the entire room except for the employees and my fiends plus some shiiiiiity margaritas. The table girls were all putting their fishnet stockings to rest on one of the other empty tables. I grab my jacket out of the trash cans, turn to one of the employees and say ""are you kidding me?"" He avoids eye contact. After 5 minutes I put my jacket back on the empty empty table in the empty empty club and a guy comes running over. ""GET that off the couch!"" He says ""these tables are for people who PAY."" I say ""so, we are the only people in this entire club, and no one is coming because of Coronavirus and you take my jacket and throw it in the trash because I put it on an empty bench in an empty club of which me and my friends are the only patrons?"" The guy says ""you have to pay to check your coat."" The club is empty.

He threw my coat in the trash can. Could've easily approached us and told us, hey, please don't put your coats on the empty ass tables because of club policy--especially because it wouldn't have been that hard to find us considering we were the only patrons there. He threw it in the trash. So disrespectful. Would give this place zero stars if I could.

Ps.

If you have self respect do not go under any circumstances."
80,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,11/24/2018,"Phenomenal. Ambiance, service, cuisine, cocktails. Everything was great.

We went with a party of four before a Bruins game, so it was busy, but everything came out quickly, and our server made sure we were out the door on time for the puck drop.

The maple smoked Vermont cheddar and tecate braised onion quesadilla, and guacamole started out our meal. The barbacoa tacos were incredible (they cooked them with maguey leaves just like in Mexico!!!). We also had tamales, which didn't have a hint of dryness (my usual tamale complaint). Shrimp fajitas came with a huge portion of shrimp and were very tasty. The biggest sheet of nachos ever served in a restaurant was a shared plate for the table, and it was still yielding fully topped chips at the end of the tray... No bare nachos here!

Margaritas were amazing. The strawberry mezcal was smokey and sweet without being overpowering. The waiter mentioned the strawberry was an infusion, so no gross syrupy puree here. Jalapeno margarita was a hit across the table with everybody happy with the ratio of jalapeno spiciness to limey tartness, to agave nectar sweetness.

We waffled back and forth on whether or not to get dessert, but were glad we went for the home made churros. They were a perfect delicious light way to end our meals. The spicy chocolate on the side was a nice accompaniment.

Would definitely go before a game, or even for a date night, because the candle lit ambiance was so nice. Like other reviews mentioned, it was a little hard to read, but once everything was ordered, the low lights and candles really made the vibe.

A great addition to canal street and a good alternative to all the beer soaked sports bars on the street!!"
81,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,3/29/2019,"Stopped in before a show at City Winery for a bite to eat. It was very busy, as it was right before a Bruins game. 
My friend and I both had the watermelon margaritas, which were very good. We were brought chips and 3 different sauces for dipping which were also good.
I had the Walking Taco, which I would not recommend. It was overly salty for me. My friend had the onion quesadilla, which I tried and thought was very good.
I would like to try another dish here on a different visit."
82,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,11/10/2019,"Honestly, where to start? 

The operations: 
A failure. I get Boston is busy, full of demanding customers and competitive. But good god. Details below if interested. Essentially, we were punished for their mismanagement and overbooking. Seems like this place was started by someone as a ""cool idea"" and not thought through, managed or maintained. Feels like there's no one there who gives a crap if the customer experience is positive - and even if they did - they lack the knowledge and experience to carry it out.  

The staff: 
Clueless, rude, uncaring, checked out, inexperienced, naive, unwelcoming and bothered. Worst I've had in Boston. We tipped but I was tempted not to for the first time in my life. 

The food: 
Average at best. Hot Cheeto street corn was great. Tacos were fine. $50 for a pitcher of ~just okay~ margaritas. Serves 4 people. One margarita on its own from the bar? $12. I'm no math expert but...

In sum:
Don't bother. Mismanaged hipster joint with nothing special to offer. You can get much better at Lolita, Lonestar, or Loco. I'm 25F living in the city and I, and my 10 friends, will not be returning. 

Our Story Details:
We booked a party of 11 for 7:30pm. They said ""sure it may be a little tight but you're confirmed"" We arrive on time, wait for 24 minutes. The restaurant has 7 open tables that I can see. 1 large enough to seat us. At then at 7:54 we are NOT shown to our table, but told ""you guys can go sit over there"" by the (rude) hostess who points to a table with 3 chairs on either side. We laugh and go ""are there 2 tables we can push together or something?"" Long story short, after 3 conversations (1 with the hostess, 1 with the waiter, and 1 with the ""manager"") we're told ""take it or leave it there's a lot of people coming in tonight."" What an unpleasant birthday experience. 30 minutes after our reservation was due to start, we are forced to ""squeeze"" or change plans for a group of 11. Unbelievable. My advice: avoid at all costs."
83,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,1/12/2019,"This place was easily accessible by car or by train on a weekday evening when I went with my friends. The server was friendly, but kept asking us if we wanted drinks, despite us saying ""no"" repeatedly. It was quite pushy and uncomfortable. 

The food was just okay - nothing special. We all shared guacamole as an appetizer and ordered empanadas (2) and the chicken burrito as our meals. The prices weren't horrible, but they charged me $3 to add avocado to my burrito  

Towards the end, when it was clear that we were all set and ready for the check, the same server took over 8 minutes to come to our table because he was chatting it up with the table right next to us, facing in a direction where he could see us clearly. He then finally finished up his conversation and walked away, glanced at us, turned around, did a double take, and STILL didn't come ask us if we were ready for the check."
84,Bodega Canal,1 star rating,10/9/2020,I was excited to come here but the service was awful. The waiter was extremely rude and would ignore what we said. Would not recommend and will not be returning.
85,Bodega Canal,4 star rating,12/5/2017,"I was pleasantly surprised with this place. We came here for a late dinner. Since it's new, I really wasn't expecting to be blown away and well...I wasn't BUT it's still a cool place. 

It's a really big space. There's the restaurant part, the bar area and then a lounge. We were sat upstairs next to the fireplace so we got a good view of everything that was going on. They also have music playing and the playlist isn't too bad. 

For dinner we tried a few different things. We started with the chips & salsa, street corn & short rib empanadas. The empanadas were my favorite part of the entire meal (and the margaritas). The corn wasn't too bad. The chips & salsa can be skipped, they weren't good at all. For entrees we had the crispy chicken tacos and the tempura fish tacos. You get 2 in each order which means the price per taco runs about $5.50-$9 each. They didn't skimp on the ingredients in the tacos. They were ok. Not amazing, just ok. 

I would come back to this place strictly for the environment. It would be a great place to chill and have some drinks."
86,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,10/10/2019,"Super swanky bar that is a good mix of restaurant on the upstairs, causal drinks on the middle floor, and more of a danse vibe on the bottom floor. Gets pretty crowded by 10 pm but really cool vibe for whatever your looking for."
87,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,8/22/2019,"From the decor to the cocktail program to the food - Bodega Canal is a welcomed spot on Canal Street. Whether you're celebrating a birthday, getting margs with co-workers after work or want a date night - Bodega should be a key consideration when looking at the Garden area."
88,Bodega Canal,3 star rating,10/5/2018,"Overall, just ok and not on par with Lolita or other mid-high end Mexican spots in the city even though the prices are almost equivalent. 

The tacos were tiny and not very flavorful, honestly you couldn't even taste any marinade on the chicken. The ""infamous"" corn appetizer tasted too smoky and not that good. 

Service was good and the drinks decently strong for the price. I had a couple of Paloma's and they all tasted very different so consistency is not key. 

Nothing to write home about -- would only come back if I were in the area and probably only for the drinks."
89,Bodega Canal,5 star rating,8/8/2018,"So this is Boston it's near Haymarket station, walking distance to Faneuil Hall and the home of the Boston Celtics and Bruins is down the street. So if you visit here you visiting Boston Boston. Great atmosphere it has this rich mansion but is past feel to it. So I really enjoyed the "" rosita"" drink of the bunch I order ""mamacita"" and ""devil purse"" were also good picks but Rosita was the fav from the bunch. Chicken and fish tacos were amazing  chips and 3 salsas was a must and the patata brava was a solid pick for apps or starters. Overall I'm a fan and will be making another visit soon"

They won't answer the phone they didn't even cut the pizza correctly worst service ever. I'll be contacting corporate and having their asses believe that.

But I am told that I am wrong and that they ALL look like this because they go through the same oven! Really?!? The fate of your pizza depends on who is working that night. Yes... I'm serious. 

If Baudillo (I hope I spelled that correctly) your pizza will be good. Otherwise you're screwed. You will be eating grim reaper pizza or going hungry. On that note... good luck!"
3,Domino's Pizza,1 star rating,4/18/2020,"This is SUPPOSED to be a medium hand tossed pizza with extra cheese.  WHERE?!?! Also it's pathetic that I always take that extra second to go down to preferences and click ""normal bake"" instead of ""well done"" but apparently that is completely useless. But according to the person I spoke to on the phone this is definitely not burned and it doesn't look cheesy because they will normally throw some provolone on it. ‍ -- So now I have pin thin, burned and dry pizza. Awesome! No replacement and no refund. Oh and that whole delivery insurance BS is just that, BS!!! The one time I FINALLY spoke to the owner he was extremely defensive right off the bat!

10,Domino's Pizza,3 star rating,5/17/2017,"We've been ordering from the Charlestown Dominos for years and it's generally good.  However, last week, I hit ""reorder"" from our ""favorites"" former order and when delivered (prompt delivery - that was great) 1 of the pizzas was missing one of the added ingredients (sliced sausage).  Having a pizza be missing an ingredient has happened a couple of times previously and I didn't call them on it but this time I did. It was for my husband and he had just arrived home from having major surgery.  The man who answered the phone at Dominos said he had made the pizza and had not left anything off of it and it was my mistake.  That I must not have added on the sausage when ordering.  I explained that it was a reorder of what we always receive.  He insisted it was my mistake.  Well I double checked what I had ordered and I did order the sausage so he blatantly lied.  

What happened to Customer Service?  What happened to the customer being right?  What happened to ""I'm sorry, can we make it up to you with a credit for a future order? or by crediting this order? or by delivering the correct pizza? Especially as we have been giving them business regularly for years.  How will this Domino survive if they continue to treat repeat customers poorly?"

Anyways last week I have witnessed something so dangerously gross and wished I had never seen it happened. especially from someone that handles food period! I was visiting a friend , we were watching tv, till I heard a weird accelerated sound in a parking lot then a loud crash. I can't explained what happened, I'm not even worried about him damaging his vehicle. But how did the chicken get out the box and onto the ground next to a  dumpster. ( maybe he had the box in his hand while kneeling down to look at the damage on the front of the car) DONT MATTER! I know the delivery guy had a gut feeling someone was watching but he picked up (3) pieces of chicken really fast. He gets in the car for 3-4 minutes. Probably contemplating whether should he delivered the chicken or what. I was hoping he did not. Moments later he puts his phone down and grab the pizza box and the chicken box and walks out. My friend and I was in disbelief that he really did that ! OMG! Not even to my worst enemy 
I'm still shocked 

The description of the Dominoes driver's car was a updated navy blue Toyota Corolla plate with XL ..... can't remember the rest
front hood damage  , headlight damage ( possibly both or just left driver side)

Ps: the chicken pieces were picked off from ground area with debris"

By the time all of our waiting was done, by 5 year old was passed out on my lap with a migraine because she was beyond starving and long past lunch time. To say the 20 minute walk back to the car with a 50 pound child passed out on your shoulder  was enjoyable, haha NOT.

After waiting for 45 mins I called them again and the store guy started making weird excuses. First, he said there was some traffic jam on the bridge(i can see that bridge right across from my window and there is no traffic) so the delivery guy had to take a different route i.e. go to Somerville from Charlestown and then come to Cambridge!! Are you kidding me?? Why would you go to Somerville to come to 1 Education Street, Cambridge? Then he told me there was some party in Somerville so the delivery guy had to go there first and while coming back from there he again got stuck in traffic.

0,Parla,4 star rating,1/18/2022,"Parla has an unique speakeasy vibe with great food and unusual drinks. The restaurant is quite small and intimate, so I'd recommend going with a party of 2-4. The kitchen and bar are a bit slow, so be prepared to chat with your dinner companions for a while as your drinks and food come out. Food came out hot (except for the pork belly chips) and had good sized portions for splitting. 

For food, my party of 2 ordered 4 apps and 1 main entree to split. It was a LOT of food and overall really good. I would recommend getting the burrata and arancini out of our order:
- arancini (highly recommend!)
- pork belly chips (only okay, just bacon bits)
- patatas bravas (was just French fries but really good!)
- burrata (very large portion and was delicious!)
- lamb parpadelle (fresh pasta cooked with Al dente with small lamb chunks)

For drinks, Parla's selling point is definitely the Dungeon Master where you can roll a dice and ""collect"" the 20 secret cocktails they offer. It made the dinner very fun and try different cocktails I would probably never order. Our server was very nice and would tell us a bit about each mystery cocktail that came out."

You can roll the 20 side die like dungeon and dragons and have a drink picked out for you. This is not for the faint of heart. We rolled a 15 and had a drink called Spicy Bitch. It was infused w haberno pepper. Nice flavor but hot AF. 

We had the crispy polento. Three triangular pieces. So delicious. I had the octupus salad and it was yummy. We finished with the beignets. These were warm, soft, and perfect.

They also have entrees. This is a bar with a cordial license so a twist on classic drinks."
4,Parla,5 star rating,2/5/2022,The restaurant is small and intimate. The brunch menu is really fun and and reasonably priced. That Good Good Skillet came out piping hot and everything came together nicely. The adult milkshake was surprisingly good. Would definitely come again!
5,Parla,5 star rating,9/25/2021,"Great restaurant with a fun outdoor patio and a romantic indoor vibe. The drinks are particularly excellent, though the food is also good. But really, really these cocktails are GREAT. They have a cool mystery menu that you can only order off of if you roll a dice to pick which if the 20, which i highly recommend doing. The service is incredibly friendly--Phil is the absolutely best! This place can get pretty busy on popular days so I recommend making a reservation in advance; it is one of the gems of the North End."

7,Parla,5 star rating,12/19/2021,We were told we had to eat brunch here by a local and thank goodness we did. This place is fantastic and has a great craft cocktail list as well as food. My wife and I both had the Maine lobster Benedict and that dish is amazing.
8,Parla,5 star rating,3/10/2022,"This is one of the most insane places I've ever been in my life. They have a WILD drink menu (as well as the bespoke cocktail option, which two of us did to great delight), and such a wonderful energy in what might be the smallest restaurant I've ever seen in America. We also all finished every bite of our dinners because it was so delicious, and our server was friendly & helpful. This is the kind of place with drinks so good the food could be trash, or vice versa, but both the food & drinks are to die for."
9,Parla,4 star rating,8/1/2021,"We came for drinks and snacks in-between meals and we  really enjoyed our little adventure here. Initially we were going to order the staffs picks of cocktail drinks, but the website advertised the dungeon master cocktails. They pull out a 20 sided die which you roll to decide which mystery drink you can order. Our drink flavors were funky to say the least. I don't want to spoil the surprise for people wanting to try the dungeon master, but they're definitely not drinks you would see at any other bar. Minus 1 star for our server who kept rubbing his nose while he talked to us and served our food and drinks."
10,Parla,4 star rating,11/20/2021,We came here for drinks and dinner last night and it was a great time! The lobster ravioli was very good but the best part was by far the espresso martini. SOO good. We also enjoyed the polenta appetizer! Would definitely come again!
11,Parla,5 star rating,3/26/2022,"Parla was suggested to us by a local and it exceeded all expectations! The quality of the food was unmatched with fun, fresh takes on classic delicious dishes. And the cocktails were unbelievable. We enjoyed some classics, like their take on a French 75 and the famous espresso martini, and sampled a few of their housemade shrub cocktails. The brussel sprouts were the best we've ever had thanks to that amazing lemon sauce. The garlic spinach mezzelune ravioli and the lobster ravioli were insane. The service was so friendly and welcoming. They were so enthusiastic and personable with their recommendations and suggestions. We live out of town, but we cannot wait to come back to the North End and go to Parla!"
12,Parla,5 star rating,3/13/2021,"Just as every review says, this place serves up truly outstanding and memorable cocktails. They are in the top 5th percentile of drinks I've ever tasted!

The best part is there's something for everyone and each drink I finished tasted great. What also makes this place extra special is the uniqueness in how the online drinks menu is organized - it has a charming visual aesthetic and features fruitier ""shrubs"", more traditional drinks, and there's an option where you can roll a dice to get a mystery drink! It's really unique and distinctive - I have never seen anything like it.

They also serve food! The food is delicious and varied but not executed in the same league (as it is extremely difficult to be) as their excellent cocktails. The ambiance is charming and service extra attentive.

Last but not least this place is very COVID conscious and has a very well organized QR code-scannable online menu."
13,Parla,5 star rating,10/31/2021,"The food and ambience were fantastic! You can't go wrong with anything you order off the menu. And the choose your own adventure, roll the dice for cocktails is such a fun spin."
14,Parla,1 star rating,3/23/2022,"Didn't even make it in because of how rude the manager was on the phone. His responses to people in the reviews tells it all. Also I worked in restaurants for 10 years, casual spots, and never in that time would I dream of dealing with people like Parla does, takes the whole reason for eating out away."
15,Parla,5 star rating,3/6/2021,"Awesome place! Service was a little pushy however they definitely knew how to make a good drink. They were also quick with food and drinks. Honestly every drink we ordered was delicious but the espresso martini was what's really gave this place 5 stars. Be aware, if you miss your reservation it is $125 fee..yikes."
16,Parla,5 star rating,1/21/2022,My girlfriend and I ate here to celebrate our anniversary. The atmosphere was quaint and warming. The food was delicious and so were our espresso martinis. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone dining in the North end of Boston.
17,Parla,5 star rating,8/31/2021,"Fantastic restaurant. With the addition of the street patio, there's a lot of space and a great authentic North End ambiance. Great service and an interesting selection of cocktails with delicious food."
18,Parla,5 star rating,11/21/2021,"My fiancée and I moved to Boston a couple months ago. We made a pact right before we moved that we could not eat from the same place more than once in the first 30 days of us being in the city, in an attempt to force us to try numerous different places. We ate from 26 different establishments in that time, and Parla was by far at the top of the list. We enjoyed it so much that by the tail end of the first 30 days, we were just counting the nights until we could go to Parla again. It has everything for which we were looking: friendly and accommodating staff, great ambiance, amazingly consistent food, and a treasure trove of experimental cocktails. Parla is definitely our new go-to spot!"
19,Parla,5 star rating,5/15/2021,"Great little restaurant with superb taste. I definitely think this is a must try. I would order the arancinis and apps and drinks. They have a unique style to the interior, and I think especially right now, they'd need more support during covid."
20,Parla,5 star rating,11/28/2021,"Stopped here for cocktails after dinner on a Saturday night. It was busy but they had room for 2 at the bar. Played Dungeon Master where you Roll a 20 sided Die and you have to drink whatever the number is you roll. It was so much fun watching the different drinks being made. The bartender, who seemed more like a potions master, was captivating to watch. We absolutely loved it here. Drinks and atmosphere were amazing. Don't skip it. Also take time to look through the cocktail menu books. They were a creative space for many and it was easy to get lost in the art and stories."
21,Parla,4 star rating,11/18/2021,"Fun and interesting cocktail bar! Great spot for whatever you're looking for - dinner, apps, or drinks. They've got a really unique liquor collection and offer flavor combinations to customize your own cocktail. Everything is fresh and delicious, and the atmosphere is on point."
22,Parla,5 star rating,11/9/2021,"Really cool place. Great drinks, great food and service. Love the laid back vibe and it doesn't feel stuffy like other restaurants/bars. The menu book is unique. I'd take the time to read some of the notes in there while you wait, some hilarious stuff in there."
23,Parla,4 star rating,4/13/2021,"Had an incredible overall experience at Parla - spun the die 3 times! My group and I were happy to be able to sit outside in the North End again and we've been dying to try this place.

Drinks: 9.5/10, the concept of Dungeon Master is genius. I got a cocktail with a fake hand and octopus tentacle in it it was creative and absurd and utterly enjoyable. Docking .5 points here because I wish I could've gone back to see/read what was in the cocktails but I guess that's part of the mystery?

Food: 9.5/10, delicious and well thought out menu. I had butternut squash ravioli and my boyfriend had the steak -- the best he's had in a while according to him. Docking .5 because while the other review claimed healing portions and good prices I felt that the meal sizes were average and so was the price for Hanover street. Not a bad thing just an opinion/observation.

Experience: 10/10, service was friendly and efficient. Our table was ready on time and we really felt like appreciated patrons.

I will definitely be back (I do need to complete my cocktail challenge after all)"
24,Parla,5 star rating,8/13/2020,"What a fantastic and refreshingly modern place for cocktails, especially in a part of town that prides itself on old world traditions.

This review is only for the cocktails, which deserve 6 out of 5 stars. The menu changes, and the bartenders are more than happy to pour you something special if you can't decide from the provided options. My friend and I tried several different drinks, and not a single one disappointed. All were unique and well-crafted.

Definitely stop by if you are looking for a good drink in the North End, and don't necessarily want to pair it with too much Italian food in the process."
25,Parla,3 star rating,5/1/2021,"The staff was friendly, they have a great brunch menu along with a great selection of cocktails. Everything was good but we did have to wait over an hour for our food when it wasn't very busy. Great decor and atmosphere. Nice spot for brunch"
26,Parla,1 star rating,8/1/2021,"I really wanted to love this place. It's super small and cute. The menu is great with many choices especially for the seasoned industry vet or cocktail connoisseur.  We had reservations for the bar. When we entered, the manager told us he gave our seats away (later I realize to his friends). We were ok with another table and graciously accepted. We then waited another 15 mins for the manager to return with water and then leave again without letting us order cocktails. Drinks were then ordered and brought another ten minutes later. 

We finally order our entree and said ""manager "" does not write anything down. He had already had his second shot (that I saw) by this time with the crowd at the bar. I believe it was a pickle back. 

Twenty minutes go by and he comes back with no apologies that he completely forgot what we ordered to eat. Literally, twenty minutes. At this point, I am still trying to be happy and not upset.

When the food does come, he has ordered me the wrong omelette. I flag him down to tell him and he tells me to keep my plate there. He tells me to keep my cold potatoes and biscuit because the kitchen was upset with him that he had messed up the order. 

He brings my new omelette which isn't cooked because the poor kitchen guys wanted to get the hell out of the there as they were now closed.  I witnessed him take two other shots by the time this all went down. 
We eat and order one more round. He brings my husband his drink, and not mine. Walks away. I say, may I have my drink, and his reply is, he forgot again. Obviously this manager/server was intoxicated. 

I have worked in the industry for twenty years. If I forgot a meal or a drink, it would then be on me. The fact he couldn't even own that he was so off point was upsetting. To spend $100 on BRUNCH, I think we should have been served a bit better. McDonald's would have been more apologetic. So overall we spent $120 to someone who was too drunk to even know that they ruined our time in the North End, nor care :(

Your hangover must have just cleared up that you have finally responded. Again, this is not customer service. This response is inaccurate and completely snarky. I had to go on Yelp as there was no one to actually speak to you about your bad behavior. Also, in case you forgot again, I did order a High Life that you heard and then stated to me that you FORGOT. How would it be that I never ordered if you FORGOT? Also, how could we sit at the bar when all the four seats were taken as you said you gave the seats away and we need to wait to sit there. 

How about thank you for your patronage and spending such a great deal at our establishment? Again, unprofessional and, by reading all the other responses to the negative reviews, it is surprising anyone comes there at all. I am not shocked by your unjust attitude and think you should go back to training as support staff.

I would love to know who owns this establishment and if they know about this kind of customer service provided to patrons. I don't think they would find it as amusing as you. Go take another shot as you write another gross response.

Oh and by the way my name is Sarah not Karen. Funny though."
27,Parla,5 star rating,8/9/2019,"We popped in when we saw two open bar stools to kill some time before a dinner reservation. We were happy it wasn't too crowded since it was Friday night (this place is tiny). All the staff we encountered were really great and bartender - really welcoming.

Come here for the experience! From tossing and flipping cups to the outstanding old fashioned mustaches, this place is really unique. We tried the Dungeon Master game, where you roll a legit metal 20-sided dice across the bar for a surprise $15 drink. 

I rolled a Smoke in the Sunshine and it was good! I may not have picked this on a list so I'm happy it pushed me to try something new. We'll be back next time we are in Boston!"
28,Parla,5 star rating,9/18/2021,"Went for a wedding day brunch with a small groom party. Was amazing. They had a water glass that was perceptively funky and didn't help our hangover, it was funny! Bacon was awesome. Best brunch in the north end so far! I would go back and enjoy the service and food."
29,Parla,5 star rating,7/7/2021,"I really would give this 4.5 stars if I could. Quaint little place with sneaky good food!! We sampled three starters; pork belly, polenta ad the burrata. The burrata was awesome, great flavor, fresh tomatoes. Loved it. Polenta was good as well. And the pork belly, really interesting dip with it, a lemon aioli I think. At first the lemon caught me off guard, but I ended up really liking how it contrasted the pork. Delicious. 

The drinks; we didn't roll the dice. I'm in my 50's, I want what I want. I had a nice Boston Cider, Bantam, which was very good. My friend simply asked the bartender to make her a sweeter drink with no gin or vodka, and he whipped up a drink she loved. 

Dinner; she said it was the best carbonara she's had, which includes her trip to Italy, so that says a lot. As for me, I'm a NY food snob, nobody does Italian like NY. HOWEVER, Parla was right there. A nice spin on Chicken Parm, not what I'm used to but still very good. Wish they'd put some more sauce on it, but I like a lot of it. They surely would have gotten it for me if I asked. I did ask for a white sauce on the pasta. They say it was Alfredo but it was lighter, and incredibly delicious!!!  Next time I'm in Boston I'll be back."

31,Parla,2 star rating,6/20/2021,"This place is small. Seating is available but somewhat smooshy. Also the PROPORTIONS ARE TINY. I got the Maine Benny and the meal came with 8 slices of potato and 4 slithers of lobster. 4/10 

Management is nice tho!"
32,Parla,5 star rating,2/4/2021,"With Parla, reputation matters. The music was great, the ambiance, the booths the food and the drinks. The night was 10/10 until one small mistake. The manager quickly introduced himself and did whatever he could to make things right. Someone who demonstrated that he cares about his job and the place he works for.
Will return :)"
33,Parla,3 star rating,10/20/2020,"Swanky cocktail spot with a HUGE variety of cocktails to choose from. They really have something for everyone's tastes. The housemade shrubs are super interesting and make for a unique drink. Located on Hanover St in the North End, Parla's ambiance somehow skirts the line between an upscale spot and a hipster speakeasy. The drinks are expensive for their size, but you're paying for the quality and not quantity. (Read: don't expect to get drunk here). The outdoor patio seating is really nice right now since the indoor area is rather small.

One important thing to note is that if you make a reservation, they *will* require you to order meals (not just apps), or a surplus of drinks. If your intentions are to just grab a drink and app before dinner at one of the other North End restaurants, you need to come put your name on the list instead."
34,Parla,3 star rating,9/4/2021,"Average food and service, 2.5 stars. Yes, they were busy, but we were rushed out in 1 hour and 15 minutes. 1 drink each, apps and entrees. Small place so they need to churn the tables to be profitable I guess. My wife and daughter got their drinks and 15 minutes later we had to ask for mine. Never asked if we'd like another one.  Waiter brought our check and I asked ""Do you have coffee and desserts"" and he said ""Oh yeah, we have those"". Not even ""would you like some?""

In response to the manager: We totally understand we're in a pandemic. You're a very small establishment and maybe you shouldn't have added so many extra tables out on the street if your staff is not capable of handling the volume.

We actually arrived and checked in 10 minutes before our 7:30 reservation.  Waited outside and people watched for until 7:45 when we were seated. No problem, it was a beautiful night. Check was delivered to our table before 9. Not once during our 1 hour and 15 minutes were we asked how it was, would we like another drink (yes, we would have!), or would we like coffee or dessert.

Regardless, the food was average. Let me know if you'd like more details on the Risotto and Chicken Parm dinners."
35,Parla,4 star rating,6/16/2021,"We feel somewhat embarrassed that it took us so long to finally make it here. We are not big fans of North End to begin with, but seeking good cocktail bars has always been our quest and knew this was one to check out. Much to our surprise - they only have a cordial license here (which required some Googling to educate ourselves what that even means.....) - so its doubly impressive what they accomplish here. Drinks are top notch - and we very much appreciate the effort put in to their impressive variety of shrubs and gastriques. We were pleasantly surprised by the very good food options and everything was quite tasty. We'll definitely make it back to try more!"
36,Parla,1 star rating,5/14/2021,The north end is known for its incredible food and this place... does not belong. Food was awful tried multiple things and it was all terrible. The cocktails and service are the saving grace of this place
37,Parla,4 star rating,6/6/2019,"So I was invited to dinner with my colleagues during my stay in Boston.  They invited me to dinner in Boston's North end, also known as Little Italy.  As the Lyft driver drove down the tight streets packed with people, I could smell the delicious aroma of Italian food.

We pull up to Parla and the outer facade reminded me of a small and quant bar.  The weather was nice so they were able slide open the windows to allow the diners to eat Al fresco.  It was great to eat with fresh air coming in to the dining area.  The seating area was rather small...I think you could fit a max of 30 or so people to dine at any given time.  

We were greeted with menus which was also interesting.  The reminded me of a journal book as they had blank sheets that allowed diners to write comments about their experience at the restaurant.

On to the food... delicious! We started off with the grilled brussel sprouts which were tasty and had a perfect crisp on the outer shell.  We also ordered the wild boar meatballs which had the perfect consistency and flavor.  For entrees, we had the Maine lobster ravioli (YUM!), Chicken parmiagana and the Chicken Caronara.  All delicious and tasty dishes.

Lastly, the servers knew we were from out of town so they brought us free shots which they took along with us. I guess we left a good impression on them as they gave us free shots.

Would definitely visit again"
38,Parla,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"My friends and I came here for a farewell dinner for one of our roommates and we couldn't have had a better evening. The food was incredible, the servers and bar staff were filled with personality and happy to crack a joke, and the drinks were inspired and delicious. For such a small venue nothing felt cramped. The bartender was kind enough to make us his own version of a green tea shot (which was better, as expected). This spirited hole in the wall is truly a gem. Thank you to all the staff for being part of such a memorable night."
39,Parla,5 star rating,5/29/2021,What a great experience! Welcoming host and top notch service. We wanted a quick drink before dinner and they fit us in between reservations. Wine was great and the calamari was delicious. We will be back for dinner soon!
40,Parla,4 star rating,7/3/2021,Fun spot to grab food and drinks.  Grab the dice and try crazy drinks you would never normally order... like this one #19 a Dutch Martini with a pickled octopus leg... an adventure  for sure.
41,Parla,5 star rating,11/21/2021,"Such a cozy spot! Great cocktails and Italian food, can't go wrong. Loved the atmosphere (warm & quirky, there is a little bar with 4 seats!) and even though it was busy, we were really well attended to by our server. Thanks for a wonderful evening!"
42,Parla,1 star rating,11/4/2021,"this review is based on 2 Parla visits, and personal experience working at a high end cocktail bar -

our 1st visit was amazing. we didn't book a reservation because the website recommended reservations for people interested in dinner, and we were more interested in post-dinner cocktails. but when we got there, the host seemed surprised that we respected that sentiment? ... at the end of the day, we waited like we should and had an amazing server, amazing cocktails, and amazing experience. our server asked what we thought of the cocktails and would give a brief intro to them. overall would definitely come back.

and then we came back! the same week actually (former bostonians, but only in town a few times a year now). we made a reservation this time (based on the last time) but the experience was AWFUL! the second we were seated the server was pushing entrees or else 3 drinks for everyone within 1.5 hours. unfortunately very obvious. we had some apps, some entrees, some drinks for our first round -  (which overall wasn't enough for them) but we were willing to look past it. but this pushing CONTINUED. they came by way too frequently asking for our next order - never failing to mention that our reservation ended at xyz PM. sometimes we could even see someone whispering in our server's ear. at this point we didn't feel welcome, and felt it was forced & rushed. if I had been in charge of the bill I wish I could have docked from the restaurant/bar and not our server.

such a different experience for me because I work for cocktail bar owners who actually CARE. unfortunately that is not this place, all they care about $$$ more than anything else. so maybe we will be back (?), but it's definitely not a first choice."
43,Parla,3 star rating,10/2/2020,"Went for brunch with a friend during covid restrictions - it was good! Would want to come back when it's more firm in its direction.

We had an outdoor brunch for 2 - food options are a great range, albeit most meat dishes have pork, which can be restricting for those with religious diet restrictions. They don't sub for turkey sausage/bacon, so I ended up doing steak as well as the sweet dishes. Food was 3/5, not the most seasoned or great in portion size. 
I did LOVE the drinks though! They came in cute and unique shaped glasses. Refreshing for a nice outdoor brunch.

My reservation for which I can't rate it higher is that the service was sub par even though it was not busy when we went and there were only 2 other diners. It took quite some time to get the waitress' attention and even then, our bills were mixed up. We were charged on our card for another table's bill and I had to notice it and ask them about it, which they the. reversed. Just seems like that error shouldn't have been made since it wasn't particularly busy either! 

Ultimately, it's a good, solid breakfast spot. I'd love to try it again when indoor dining opens up! (:"

One of the best, if not the best craft cocktails of my life. Our bartender was a blonde haired man whose name I cannot recall. He was super helpful and friendly. I was visiting Boston and if I return this place is definitely on my list."
45,Parla,4 star rating,12/8/2018,"Cute place that takes reservations in a small space with great cocktails and a little more mediocre food - Parla has its share of hits and misses.

Hits: cute space and reservations in the north end make it an attractive option. After deconvoluting a rather confusing menu, they have quite an extensive cocktail list. Not much of a cocktail person myself, I decided to try the sangria, which was deliciously flavored with lychee. My lobster ravioli was delicious, and came with hefty pieces of grilled shrimp. 

Cons: not really a con per say, but the appetizers weren't that exciting. The octopus was were tiny and mixed in with far more potatoes than octopus. I tried a friend's pappardelle, and it was okay, although not among the best that I've had (SRV, Giulia, Red hen in DC, etc) 

Overall cute place, particularly for drinks. Food wasn't really anything to come back for."
46,Parla,5 star rating,5/1/2021,"What an amazing dining experience from start to finish!!! Whatever you do, GET THE PATATAS BRAVAS lol. We enjoyed the meatballs as well and then had chicken parm and spaghetti carbonara for entrees (carbs for DAYS... soo worth it). Best carbonara I've ever had and their beer/cocktail selection is really wonderful. I love a place that does a smaller menu exceptionally well and this was definitely that kind of place. The wait staff was also amazing! Thanks for the birthday shot :) don't skip this place when you're in the area! PS- They have plenty of outdoor seating (probably more than inside!)"
47,Parla,4 star rating,7/28/2019,"DINNER REVIEW

My girlfriend and I walked in here on Wednesday night around 8 PM for dinner and were seated immediately, right next to what would be the window but there was no window!). I had heard good things about this place and it seemed like they had some modern takes on classic Italian dishes. This is not your typical North End Italian restaurant.

SETTING: This place is small and has a cute bar in the back. It maybe seats 20 people. You will definitely be able to hear the conversations of the people next to you so don't plan to come here if you're looking to have a private conversation.

DRINKS: We didn't order any but I have heard great things about the drinks. They have this dice you can roll where each number corresponds to a drink so you can let fate choose your drink.

FOOD: The menu is small for a North End restaurant (which I like) but it definitely has some things you wouldn't find on a classic old-school Italian restaurant menu (i.e. ceviche, patatas bravas, chicken & waffles). They also refer to a certain section of the menu as ""(Biggie) Smalls"" and they have a picture of Notorious B.I.G. So again, not your typical North End Italian restaurant.

Fresh Burrata - You cannot go wrong with burrata and this was no exception. It came with fresh bread and tomatoes and pumpkin seeds. Would definitely order these again.

Ricotta Fritters - These were yummy fried dough/cheese balls but there were only 4 to the serving which I thought was somewhat skimpy for $9. I would skip these.

House Made Pappardelle - fresh pasta with a delicious homemade lamb ragu. My only wish with this was that it was a bigger serving.

Overall, it was a great experience but I would want to check out other places in the North End before coming back. Don't come here if you're looking for huge portions."
48,Parla,5 star rating,4/16/2021,"This place is amazing! Highly recommend rolling the D-20 for a mystery drink. Phil, Denise and co. Give great service and are incredible personable. Food was quality and the atmosphere is perfect for a date, group setting, or fun family dinner.

49,Parla,2 star rating,9/29/2019,"It pains to me write this review as I really wanted this to be my post btone weekend brunch spot. We have now been twice and experienced horrible customer service. Like the kind that leaves you scratching your head bad. 

Visit #1 - have a reservation for six. Show up and tell one of the employees. They start setting up the table. In walks a group of six people clearly friends with one of the employees, owner maybe?, (fist bumps and all). They looked at us and one girl asked the main guy friends with the employee if they had to wait because we were ahead of them and the guy turns and looks at us as and laughs and says no he has this. Guess what happens? The table that was being set up for us is given to them. No apology, nothing. The guy friendly with the group feigned ignorance about us having a reservation and having checked in. We had to wait for another group to leave to sit down. Food was good. The cocktails were really good.

Visit #2 - have a reservation for three. Check in, and are asked if we were the party of three that called in to see if they could accommodate four. Not us. The restaurant is 75 % empty and we aren't seated. The employees seemed to be scrambling trying to figure something out. Finally we are offered a two top and told they will add a chair. They blamed their reservation system for not mapping out all the seatings. We left. Please remember the restaurant was 75% empty and several four tops were open, which, I assume, one was being saved for the the other three person group that called to add another person.

Maybe I am delusional but it is my opinion a business establishment should treat all customers with welcoming and respect. Apparently this is not a motto adopted by Parla. Both brunch visits were met with reservations either not honored nor treated with kindness and respect. No apologies or remorse more of by the guys delivering mess ups but rather indignation we would assume because we had a reservation it means we would sit down. We eat out all the time but have gotten the message we are not welcomed here. 

**If you are looking for an amazing brunch spot with killer cocktails head to Alcove you will not be disappointed and will always be welcomed (even without a reservation). SO SO GOOD!!**

Two stars for the well crafted cocktails."

If anything, she knows something about me, I'm a huge nerd and their ""Dungeon Master"" drink list would be dangerously fun for me such that I would definitely become a regular. Roll a 20-sided die, you get a pre-selected, secret drink. $14, no give-backs, who knows what you'll get. The two we had were delicious.

Settled on a smaller street, you can see foot traffic pass by as you embibe your food and beverage. We ordered a variety of small plates ranging from pork ""chips"" (deep fried cuts of pork belly, fried to a crisp, served with a brightly spiced aioli) to lamb skewers served with a fresh herb salad. 

The esthetic is classical speakeasy with some modern twists. The service was informed as the staff was limited, but that's fine considering the restaurant is fairly small."
51,Parla,4 star rating,8/22/2021,The drinks were outstanding. We walked by the restaurant as a party of 4 and decided to check it out - we had heard great things!  We were seated immediately but were told that we would have about forty minutes until 6:30pm when a party with a reservation arrived. Totally fine! We ordered cocktails and they were incredible. We would have liked to order food but we waited too long to decide. Next time! The next reservation arrived early so our table was cleared a little earlier than expected. I only wish I'd been able to finish my drink first :). We would love to come back to experience the food soon.
52,Parla,5 star rating,8/21/2021,Food and staff are amazing! Incredible cocktails and food. Best time you will have in Hanover st!
53,Parla,5 star rating,6/23/2020,"So happy to go out to eat and grab drinks again. Came here last Friday and had a wonderful time. 

Drinks were amazing and the servers were extremely helpful if you are unsure what you are in the mood for. I ended up getting a blackberry Mescal Mule and it was amazing. 

Food was incredible. We started with the cheese plate because you can't go wrong with meat and cheese and it was soooo good. For my main course I got pasta with shrimp and my friend got lobster ravioli. They give you a lot of food and the price wasn't bad for being the north end. They also have some non Italian foods like burgers and salads.  

We had a great experience and I can't wait to go back!!!"
54,Parla,3 star rating,7/10/2021,Drinks were good but Business Manager was extremely rude to us. Next time will just go to any of the places nearby who I am sure can provide similar quality drinks but will treat their patrons with some respect and politeness.
55,Parla,4 star rating,2/7/2019,"Reviewing: cocktails and calamari (bar)

There are only four stools at this tiny bar, so even though most of the time when I walk by there are a couple open seats, remember that it only takes two couples deciding to go there on a whim before all four seats are gone! I was lucky on a Wednesday night to score two seats at the bar. 

First - the vibes are GOOD. This place is a cozy gem that feels upscale inside while also feeling intimate. The bartender, having only four people to serve (and orders coming in from tables) was very attentive and seemed to be in a good mood, chatting it up with us from time to time and telling jokes. The cocktail menu contributes to the interesting and fun atmosphere, which is filled with the drawings and notes of previous customers on blank pages leading up to the actual menu. They were hilarious and some were actually beautiful. It made a very fun ordering experience. 

The actual menu is very witty and fun in and of itself. There are great drink suggestions and descriptions of flavor notes, and funny remarks about the drinks. It definitely has the full-on cocktail bar thing going for it, because at the end of the menu it says that if you're not sure or want to try something new you can have a talk with your bartender who will ask you some questions and figure out what is right for you! Fun! 

The calamari was good (not spectacular) and prices for the apps were reasonable. The cocktails are pricey, as expected (two cocktails and the app ran me about $40). I would definitely come here as a novelty if I had visiting friends and family in town, or wanted to have an interesting night out for drinks rather than the typical boring bar experience. Definitely would be a GREAT first date, and fun for smaller groups of people celebrating a birthday or something like that. check it out!"
56,Parla,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"Food is good and affordable for the North End. Rolling a die for a 'mystery' cocktail is fun. Nice ambience. The place is tiny, so I'd suggest reservations."
57,Parla,1 star rating,12/26/2019,"The place to go if you want to be robbed. 
Went for a drink and apps. We got right in, took a while to have a waiter come over (about 15min), despite having two servers and a bar tender. We ordered apps and drinks when he came over. They came out and were great! 

The time to cash out came, got the check and spilt it. 
Christmas Day- woke up to find out the server added an extra $60 to my tip! Luckily I had saved the receipt and my credit card reached out and I was able to flag it. 
When we were leaving one of the waiters was saying they were all full with a 2 hr wait. The people started leaving and he goes 'tis the season'. 

Clearly it's the season for scamming their guests - happy holidays you thieves."
58,Parla,5 star rating,7/10/2021,"Came here before a dinner reservation for drinks and honestly didn't want to leave! We bellied up to the bar and enjoyed our drinks while talking to the bartender, who was awesome! Great experience!!"

60,Parla,5 star rating,4/28/2019,"Came for drinks on a Friday night and we were back on Sunday for brunch! The atmosphere and unique qualities of Parla make you want to come back time and time again - whether it is to discover a new drink or reorder an old favorite. 

For brunch we had the French toast sticks (not pictured), chicken and waffles and Old Sport. Everything was delicious! But also very heavy. Don't be surprised if you don't finish it all."
61,Parla,5 star rating,10/3/2018,This is probably one of the most unique bars I've been too in Boston! If you are feeling really adventurous - you NEED to get the Dungeon Master - you get to roll the dice and the number that gets rolled is the drink you get & no take backs!! You also get a card to keep track of the rolls/drinks you've gotten! You can even write in or draw in the menus - cool to see what other people have written about! Very awesome experience!
62,Parla,5 star rating,3/5/2020,"LOVE this place! We have been here a handful of times since moving to Boston and it's always a blast. We always get the D20, a random drink from one of twenty secret cocktails not on the menu. They give you a card to track how many of the 20 drinks you have tried, with even more secret options available to those that fill out the whole list. This has been a fun way to try cocktails we would never order on our own! We have three each so far, but we hope to try them all. 

The bar tenders wear dated outfits, and never break character. One even wears a monocle! 

Limited seating. We've never eaten there, but it's a full restaurant too. Parking may be difficult. 

Update: maybe we had one too many and started seeing monocles"
63,Parla,1 star rating,8/2/2019,"Unsurprisingly, Parla responded to this review with a rude and self-involved response. As I said on Instagram, I've never seen a business respond to a customer with such condescension and disdain before. After reading responses to other reviews, this is their standard approach to anyone who leaves less than a five star review. Regardless of how successful a business is, each customer represents a multiplier of future customers - via sharing with others, bringing future guests, and leaving reviews. As a fellow business owner, I know that customer service is of the utmost importance, as that's how I get repeat customers and secure those referrals. Parla seems to have missed out on this particular lesson in entrepreneurship.

Moral of today's story? Treat your customers with respect. Treat your disappointed customers even better. Loyalty from a recovered customer service experience can be stronger than loyalty from a good initial experience. This has been especially true in my experience - the times I've had a poor experience and then the business has fixed it - those are some of the businesses I'm most loyal to today. Hopefully this is a lesson that Parla learns soon."
64,Parla,5 star rating,8/9/2018,"Out of all the craft cocktail establishments in Boston, Parla is by far my favorite. The drinks are amazing: everything served both on and off menu is balanced, fun, complex, and delicious. While that may be true for other bars as well, what really sets Parla apart from the rest of the Boston cocktail scene is its amazing atmosphere and staff. The eclectic, hipster-chic feel of the bar kept me intrigued and satisfied while sipping my cocktails, so much so that I didn't once feel the need to distract myself with my phone. The bartender was energetic, friendly, and fun, and I felt like a regular even on my first time there.

I ordered three drinks, one classic daquiri and two from the ""dungeon-master challenge"" (a must-do for adventurous drinkers looking to spice up their cocktail experience), and each of them was so good, I could've drank it all night long. Best of all, when I went to settle my tab, they gave me a free pickle-back (whiskey with a pickle juice chaser), and the bartenders all took a smaller version of the shot with me! I'll be coming back here again for many weekends to come."
65,Parla,5 star rating,11/9/2020,Best cocktail in Boston hands down. Amazing service and overall experience. The small plates are also good. The unique drink menu and bartenders recommendations ensure you will enjoy your cocktails!
66,Parla,5 star rating,8/20/2018,"In my opinion the best cocktail bar in Boston proper and certainly anywhere near downtown. If you're at all a drinks nerd, the Dungeon Master will keep you busy for months. You will drink insane habanero, meat infusions, and some just plain delicious things too. What sets these guys apart is that they have a cordials license, not a full liquor. As a result, their palette is made much more of infusions, bitter liqueurs, and other weirdness. I feel like that's forced more creativity. I've left Boston, but this is where I return to when I'm in town on business. Regular drinks menu isn't bad either, BTW. It's an intimate place, so ask questions of the bartenders.

Food is Italian heavy, as you'd expect from the North End, but also many Greek influences. Don't get the salumi plate, it's the most boring one I've ever endured (speck, prosciutto, and dill havarti???). Almost everything else is solid. The fried Brussels and anything with the labneh are especially winners. But mainly, the food is there to soak up your booze.

Ambiance is the other winner here. Like most North End, it's tiny and intimate. Great place to take that special someone. They are gruff at first, but the servers really warm up if you talk to them.

Bonus tip: if you really like bitter, ask for a ""tumbleweed"". It's in the off menu Dungeon Master book. I might've helped invent it."
67,Parla,5 star rating,7/25/2018,"This place was a great find! Ordered the beef tips (rare) and spaghetti carbonara. The beef tips were ah-mazing. When I said rare, they cut the cow, showed the steak what a stove looked like and slapped it to the plate. It had so much flavor! My daughter loved the carbonara. I would recommend this place! 

Also, the drinks were awesome. The bar tenders are up for making you delicious random concoctions."
68,Parla,5 star rating,9/17/2019,"I can't recommend the Dungeon Master program enough. It's an extremely fun way to experience some of the most inventive and innovative cocktails in the city. 

Matt and his crew are literal wizards behind the bar."
69,Parla,4 star rating,12/8/2019,"I came for dinner during the North End holiday stroll on Friday night and didn't expect to find a table, Parla was a cozy retreat from the chilly night with a warm greeting from the dapper server/host and showed us to a lovely table.  We enjoyed the shrub/sodas - they were quite flavorful and creative, my only tip is that they are $6 and although the slanted glass and metal straw are a charming touch, there was so much ice, three sips and you're done.  The crispy polenta app was tasty with a lemony dipping sauce.  We tried the butternut squash ravioli and the lobster ravioli. Both were generous portions and priced the same, but I think I won at dinner with my lobster ravioli.  I have never had lobster ravioli actually have big chunks of lobster and actually taste like lobster!  Well done Parla- I will return for a repeat performance for sure.  Fun decor and great vibe.  They might want to switch to a fragrant free table cleaner however- the tables are close to each other and when a neighboring table is cleaned while you are eating, the spray has a very strong scent that interrupted the magical lobster experience temporarily."

71,Parla,5 star rating,2/17/2020,"So I've been coming to this place for the past 3 years consistently - hands down favorite restaurant in Boston. From the extraordinarily friendly staff, to the fun drink programs (proudly a DM2), and the amazing food, you feel at ease and almost at home every time you visit. I've only had amazing experiences at this place and always recommend Parla to everyone I know (and sometimes strangers when I can). I can't believe it took me so long to write a review for this place but I definitely recommend you stopping by for a drink, a bite to eat, or both! Also the music is always on point - just a spectacular atmosphere. I know I'm missing a lot and not providing crazy detail - check it out for yourself. My words won't be able to match your experience!

P.S. Parla is the reason I like pickle backs now"
72,Parla,5 star rating,9/15/2019,Was just there for brunch. Service was friendly and food was amazing.  Drinks were good and they were able to make drinks on point when we told them preferences.  Highly recommend for a break from the standard Italian places on Hanover.  Definite hidden gem
73,Parla,5 star rating,11/9/2019,"The North End can be a real battleground. Tourists left and right, cars crowding the streets, and most importantly, scores of restaurants tempting you. It's a jungle. So many spots, so many similar names, so many long lines, and so much red sauce.  So.  Much.  Red. Sauce.  

And then there's Parla

The menu is quirky but in the best possible way. They only have a limited liquor license, yet they have found a way to come up with dozens of creative drink options.  They only offer a few appetizer and entree options but they hit a home run. Burrata that had a sweetness that snuck up on you. Arancini with a kick.  Ricotta balls.  We had the steak tips entree and it was like the one non-red gravy dishes my nonna made on Sunday afternoons.  Waitstaff was excellent, decor was top notch. It's my new go-to in the North End."
74,Parla,5 star rating,6/24/2019,"A better meal cannot be had in the North End, of this I am sure. Exceptional service from start to finish - timely, friendly, hospitable. A lovely setting with open windows out to the hustle and bustle of the street, that does NOT deter from your experience here. Hand-crafted flavorful and imaginative cocktails for every member of your party who cares to imbibe. The appies were incredible - loved the pork belly chips (yummy tidbits of pork bell crisped & salty); the brussels sprouts were perfectly flavorful; and the ricotta fritters were amazing. Dinner?? Oh yes, please. We enjoyed the tender butternut squash ravioli with a light cream sauce, and the lobster ravioli sent us over the moon!!! Their chicken parm was some of the best I have ever had. Seriously. Get thee-self to Parla and enjoy yourselves. We did."
75,Parla,5 star rating,9/29/2020,"This place is AWESOME. The general manager was our waiter and he was amazing. High end unique cocktails that are hard to find anywhere else. Fantastic menu also with hard to find items. The decor, to include the bathroom, is super fun. The music was great. Everything about this place was 5 stars and beyond."
76,Parla,5 star rating,11/25/2019,"Brunch review!
My friends and I came here this past Saturday for my birthday brunch and we had an amazing time! Everything was wonderful from the ambience, the staff, the drink, and the food.

Food: The food was absolutely amazing! We had seven people in our party and we all got a variety of foods-- the crackwhich, the good old skillet, omelettes, and the French toast. All of us loved our food and the portions were perfect for us. My friend was craving a biscuit and even though the kitchen was closing (or closed) they accommodated her which she really appreciated! 

One thing that was odd, but did not detract from anything hence the five stars, was that some of the metal utensils (like the metal straw for the drinks) had an extremely strong metal smell to it. It was just something we noticed. For my friends who were bothered by it, all they had to do was remove the straw from their drink and it was back to being awesome.

Drinks: AMAZING! That's all i can say. We all loved their drinks and loved the ""level up"" gamification they added to their drink menu. My friends got me a shot of a ""fireball equivalent"" and it was soo good. A million times better than fireball and they also gave me this cute birthday shot with candle next to it :) 

Staff: The manager was a sweetheart and really made sure our group was taken care of. He answered all the questions we had about the drinks and struck up conversations with us as he passed by. The friendliness of him, along with the staff, really made the experience better! Also they accommodated our weird and probably annoying way to split the check haha thanks for that!

Price: Yes the prices were on the expensive side BUT your getting great food/drinks/experience--  it is SO worth it. 

Will definitely be back!!! Thanks for an awesome birthday!"
77,Parla,5 star rating,10/22/2019,"One of my favorite bars in Boston, so far...it's in the north end and they serve food but we only stopped for an afternoon cocktail. I had the most delicious cider beer. Not too sweet. Not too dry. Just perfect. The space is small but the service was excellent. While enjoying drinks and talking w other patrons we spent some time reading the stories and such that we found in the menus (front and back) wow. What a fantastic experience. We loved every minute of our time at Parla and wish we would've had time to return. We will for sure go back when we return to Boston. A must in the north end."
78,Parla,5 star rating,12/1/2019,"We stopped in while walking through the north end. There are only four seats at the bar but it is the best bar experience we have ever had. Phillip was an amazing bartender/host/artisan. the drinks were creative unusual well-prepared and he could not of been more delightful. We had a wonderful time and just watching him make all the craft cocktails was an entertainment into itself. There are Notebooks/menus at the bar where you can make diary entries.
A hoot to look through.
Would highly recommend this anytime!"
79,Parla,5 star rating,10/15/2019,"Great little pub type bar specializing in craft cocktails, beers, ciders, etc. They also serve a variety of foods that are more upscale dishes. We only drank, so I can't attest for the food. Atmosphere is quaint and comfortable. Small , but welcoming. Staff was extremely polite, helpful and knowledgeable. A ""must try"" if ur in this neighborhood."
80,Parla,5 star rating,8/26/2019,"Great spot, we've been there a few times now and my favorite is the dungeon master drink - don't worry you don't play any game. Just toss the dice and you get a surprise drink. They do have a set list of drink for the numbers so it's not like the whim, it's more curated and delicious. I had some type of Negori and it was really good.
We also had some small bites and pasta to share among 5 people. Delicious. 
We did stop by around dinner time and they didn't have any available table but was happy to take my number and reserve us a spot for 10pm. they will text you to let you know when it's ready."
81,Parla,5 star rating,4/6/2019,"My brother put Parla on my radar a few months ago and I've been dying to try it out. So I set it up to go there for dinner and drinks for my birthday. While looking at the website I noticed they have a Gatsby themed brunch so I figured what the heck, let's do a back-to-back celebration. 
I was a little stressed trying to get my large group to arrive on time bc it's obvious on the website that punctuality is pretty important. Finally got the group there a hair after the reservation but we were seated, treated very well, and had the best experience over a few hours there. Many of us decided to roll the 20-sided die to determine our drinks, which frankly was the biggest draw for me. It was a blast! The cocktails were great and hugely varied. Our server took the time to chat with us about what was in the drinks..it was fun to vibe with him about the creativity that went into crafting each drink. The apps were delicious and we were all well-fed. When the entrees came out we were in indulgent heaven. Lobster ravs and chicken saltimbocca were favorites. Ended with a final roll of the die and cinnamon beignets which they had put a lit candle in to celebrate my birthday. Daniel brought our check along with a taste of the housemade key lime pie limoncello. What a treat this place is!! Couldn't have been happier with the experience. Thank goodness because I'd already had a set reservation with a different group of friends for brunch. That was also delightful. The food is so, so tasty. The bloody Mary was a tad spicy for me, but dang. The complex flavors they developed in there were awesome! All this to say, highly recommend. Make a reservation, show up on time with your full party, and just jump in to the full experience they create for you at Parla!"
82,Parla,4 star rating,5/8/2018,"A fun place for delicious drinks! We went after our dinner for a night cap and this place was open (yay). Lots of options including non-alcoholic drinks, wine, mixed drinks and more. The person that helped us initially said the kitchen was closed but when we begged, she let us order 2-3 items from the menu. Hehe.

The establishment is small but mighty. Fun staff and great atmosphere. Menu is fun and quirky. You can draw on the menu and leave your mark! Love the vibe and would come back here again!"
83,Parla,5 star rating,3/7/2021,"Visiting here from Miami, the ambiance is amazing, the drinks are creative, and the service was amazing. This is a spot I see myself coming to if I ever come to Boston again. A must try spot, Patrick was amazing, great service!"
84,Parla,5 star rating,2/11/2018,"Parla is a true hidden gem. It's tucked away in plain sight on Hanover St, but don't be intimidated by its limited seating and small bar. I've visited this place many times and it just keeps getting better!

Tips:
There are only 4 seats at the bar, you cannot stand there. 

Do not seat yourself.

Each bartender is extremely talented, so trust them! The menu gives you a variety of ways to do this. You can flip through each bartenders' personal creations. You can roll a 20-sided die (known as the Dungeon Master) and get a clever concoction at random. You can also just tell them what you're into, and they'll make something great. 

I recently tried one of Bebe's drinks, The Giving Tree, and it was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. Ask for it. And if Bebe is working, ask her what inspired it! Truly a dreamy cocktail. 

Parla gives you an intimate, speak-easy ambiance, combined with knowledgeable and talented mixologists. You'll nearly forget you're on Hanover Street."
85,Parla,5 star rating,9/2/2019,Special handcrafted Cocktails. This place was special with so much personality in the atmosphere and the bartenders. Skip the menu and let these bartenders craft something new for you!

Even after showing up 45 mins early to reservations you seated us by the window as request in my reservation along with fully explaining how your menu could accommodate my dairy aversions. 
Loved the hipster vibe and kind service.  Attentive and personable. 
Love the small space environment.  Exactly what I was after for a North End experience.
Custom drinks were great.
Loved the brussel sprouts and meatballs."
87,Parla,3 star rating,4/13/2018,"Fun place for drinks! If you're not picky, play the Dungeons & Dragons game where you roll a die and get served a mystery corresponding drink (that isn't on their drinks menu)! 

If you're a picky party-pooper like me, their regular drinks are tasty too. I got the sangria and was happily in sweet fruity heaven! 

But stay away from the food menu!!! Everyone in our group of 5 ordered pasta and it legitimately took 45-50 mins before we ever saw our food. Not only was it incredibly slow, but the portion sizes were very small and most of our party left hungry and on the hunt for dinner round 2. Later the waiter apologized to us, explaining that the delay was because they had to defrost some ingredients. Way to reassure us about the freshness of the food. 

Overall - not a bad place for drinks but look elsewhere for food! Also it's a small space that accommodates max 20, so plan accordingly!"
88,Parla,5 star rating,11/3/2019,"It's small, select, sexy place with smashing food and drinks....and amazing service .. the ambience is unique and takes you to a different place, no matter where you came from"
89,Parla,2 star rating,2/23/2019,"BEWARE: Bartender is a complete asshole.

This is my first review on yelp and it is because in the past four years of living in Boston, I've never had a such a bad experience and therefore have never felt compelled to leave a bad review.

It's interesting to me that there are similar reviews here about the bartenders and it's even more interesting how the manager replies to their comments.

With a party of 5 we all sat at the bar ready to order our drinks, the way we were sat and given menus was cold to begin with but it was dismissed in my head. 

Because of a medical condition that I had I could not drink and in solidarity neither did my boyfriend- for this reason we ordered our drinks virgin. For some reason this seemed to slight the bar tender. Microagressions were definitely made the whole time we were there but we just ignored them. The ""brush"" soda drink he made for me was nasty and same with my boyfriends drink. I didn't complain but when the bartender asked us how our drinks were my boyfriend said that I didn't like mine. I'm not one to complain but I think we all wanted to see how the bartender would react. He just took my drink off the counter threw it out didn't say anything to me and didn't even ask me if I wanted something else. 

His whole rude attitude was comical in our eyes. We also saw the other male bartender being rude to the people at the table next to us, he was talking to them harshly and said ""I don't mean to be rude BUT "" , when someone uses that line you already know...

Anyways - save yourselves from an awkward evening !"
0,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,2/19/2022,Best dairy free + vegan pizza in Boston! The staff was so accommodating and friendly. Also the absolute best French fries I have ever had in my life.

2,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,4/7/2022,"The pizza is a classic NY style pie. The place is a staple being right across from the Garden. There's no other place that can give you a quality slice of pizza and handle the demand of the Garden crowd. The pizza is very good -- locals go out of their way for a pizza from here on a regular day, not just because of a bruins or Celtics game. Dough is made in house. Been around since 1981 (technically since 1967) and it's now being run by second generation. Serves beer as well. Tell em wesaygravy sent you!"

Is it the best pizza? No.

Is it good enough to satisfy that craving? Yes.

The pizza overall was ok. The cheese blend felt a bit too sharp of a flavor. But overall fine.

Nice place. Tv everywhere. 

Cookie wasn't too great."
4,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,3/14/2022,"Located right across the street from TD, this spot caters to pre and postgame Celtics/Bruins fans. I grabbed a chicken parmesan sandwich and a tall beer before Friday night's Celtic game against the Pistons. The line moved quickly and the guys behind the counter worked their tails off to pump out slices, sodas, beers and sandwiches. The sandwich was excellent and the fresh sesame seed roll was the best part. Prices are on par for the location but cheaper than eating inside TD."

8,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,2/22/2022,"Wish i could do a better review of this restaurant but can't do it cause of bad treatment of one subject woking there. Had a great start being helped by a nice gentleman that was very attentive and courteous when another man stepped up with a very rude attitude and tried to diminish the guy that was helping us originally, to have someone like him in frontline already took a couple of stars. I should give a one star to this review but food and the attention of the first guy gave it back another 2stars. Wish that people wouldn't be judged by their color or by their looks cause i came here just trying to have a good meal with the family and was clearly mistreated by our looks. Management should look into this so it doesn't happen again cause food quality does overcome this little situation. Might try again next time in town , hoping to have the experience I wished to have when I first arrive. Just to finish food was outstanding and will make a a big impact on my decision on coming back here."
9,Halftime Pizza,1 star rating,1/13/2022,Pizza was so burnt. We ordered 2 pizzas to go and the cheese was so burn on the bottom. The other pizza was wayyyyyyy to greasy. Good if you are drunk and want a slice I guess but don't recommend

11,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,1/16/2022,"There's nothing like a Bruins game without a slice of pie from this spot. I've been waiting for this spot to open back up since covid, and think they are serving pies better than before. Grab a buffalo slice, you want regret it!
Also guy with glasses behind the bar knows how to treat his customers!"
12,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,11/13/2019,"Halftime Pizza gets about half of five stars. Do the math. It's not a place I'd go outta my way for but it's a convenient pregame place, for better or for worse.  My One and I went to the Bruins game and zipped directly across the street to Halftime. The 'za smelled good from the street and it was an olfactory atavism to Leonard's Pizza in Haymarket back in the 70s. 

A zoo inside with droves of pregamers and pizzas (mostly in slice form) being doled out by the hundreds. A subway-station ambiance featuring an indestructible interior that withstands years of animalistic abuse by sports fans. Sports stuff is played on the TVs peppered about this packed-as-can-be place. Tonight aired the soothing sights and sounds of a ""best of"" compilation of classic hockey fights.

The 'za is thin krust and very light on sauce and cheese. But it tastes fine and is very mild in flavor and the krust was nicely krispy. Moey ordered while I grabbed a booth. She ordered a whole 'za for us to split but they ""suggested"" that she just get slices. Why bother to make a new pie that's fresh and hot for the customer? Screw it. Just make people eat slices already made. The 'za slices were not too hot and a bit coagulated but acceptable if you're not too picky. I personally need a 'za that is totally oven-hot AF. It can't be sitting around for even few femtoseconds. But that's just me...

Halftime is what it is...  a place that has pizza...

Go Bruins!"
13,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,8/25/2019,"Halftime Pizza came highly recommend & it didn't disappoint. I personally categorize pizza in 2 categories subway/boardwalk vs specialty/gourmet.
Halftime falls at the top end of the subway/boardwalk category. Big slice, plenty of topping, great cheese & cheap! Enough said!"
14,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,2/11/2018,"Just happened to be across the street at the Tip O'Neil Building on business, as I was leaving I decided to grab a quick snack. As I walked down Causeway Street towards my car, I was about to pass the Halftime Pizza Parlor. I've always meant to grab a slice during a game/event at the Garden but there were always extra long lines. Today was the day, No Line. I ordered a slice of Roni and proceeded to a table. The slice was a perfect example of a Boston/New York Slice. Crisp Crust, a little tang in the sauce and the appropriate amount of cheese. Price was about average for a slice around town. 

I give Halftime Pizza a Solid 4 Stars."
15,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,1/10/2020,"A quick spot to hit up right before an event at the garden. I came during a Bruins game and they had the pizzas limited to just cheese and pepperoni which is understandable since they are busy and just want to churn them out. 

Prices are not too bad either. I paid $4.55 for a pepperoni slice which is really a bargain when you compare it to the $12 slices inside the garden. The pizza was hot out of the oven and the crust was nice and thin. I typed it with some oregano, cheese, and red chili flakes after I paid. 

They also have a decent amount of space and also sell alcohol as well for you to pregame."
16,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,1/4/2020,Halftime Pizza is perfect for a slice of pie either before or after an event at TD Garden. Service is fast and their slices are big and easily foldable. The 80's style eating area has great charactures of sports and wrestling superstars (Andre the Giant!).
17,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,11/12/2019,"Just a few blocks away from the TD Garden you can grab a pizza, you will pay almost $30 for a large pizza, but worth it with a group. The pizza is thin crust with your typical toppings. I especially enjoyed the cheese blend. The atmosphere was great with Boston memorabilia and sports heroes located on the walls and in the ceiling, this is the perfect place to grab a bite before a game, but get there an hour early so you can grab a seat because it fills up quick!"
18,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,2/7/2019,"Halftime Pizza gets 5 stars for the experience alone (yes, the pizza is good too!).

We came by for slices before the Bruins game this week, and the place was JAMMED with fans! The energy in here was awesome, and everyone was clearly excited for the game. They play game footage in the seating area, and have nice big beers. What more could you want, right?

Super conveniently located directly across from the new entrance to the Garden, Halftime is your go-to for an authentic Boston experience. I will definitely be back before the next game!"
19,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,6/29/2019,This place gets busy before an event at TD Garden and with good reason. The pizza slices are perfect and they have 20 oz beer on tap. This place is a time honored tradition.
20,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,10/21/2018,"Came here before a bruins game last weekend. It was perfect, it's directly across the street, the slices are really big and the service was very fast. The prices here are way better than what you would pay in the garden for a beer as well! Come here to drink before the game huge 20oz beers for way less! I liked the art work on the wall of the Boston Sports teams as well. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in the city for a game. Pro Tip go to the back counter the line is much quicker!"
21,Halftime Pizza,2 star rating,12/17/2019,After years of patronage.  I'm done.  I spent $100 on food and beer..  and they can't give my wife a cup of water to drink at the counter.  Simple fix... Watch your customers and kids won't share drinks.
22,Halftime Pizza,2 star rating,8/8/2018,"Pretty good. Tried a few of the subs but not the pizza.

Big complaint: It was before a concert at the garden and some douchebag was going around the whole place to people in line and table to table trying to sell bootleg t-shirts. And he didn't get kicked out. I have zero tolerance for getting solicited while I'm hanging out trying to eat in peace."
23,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,10/19/2016,"If you're interested in a quick easy spot to grab a bit to eat before a Celtic's game, look no further than Halftime Pizza. With giant slices and huge beers, you're getting a good deal with a ton of food. It's a family friendly spot with fans of all ages gearing up for the game."
24,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,11/6/2017,"Yeah the service is terrible.  Yeah the pizza is not that good.  The guy who hands the pizza out is the unhappiest person I have ever met.  However, the location is good and the beer is cold.  I recommend buying a whole pie if you are going to buy more than 4 slices because you will save money by doing so.  Way cheaper than buying anything in the actual TD Garden.  Kind of wish the staff here would appreciate customers a bit better.  I am a regular here, but given a choice (if there was anything else down here), I'd go somewhere else because the staff is just so disrespectful."
25,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,3/2/2018,"32oz beers. Super fast service with tons of counters. Wicked crowded, not a place to have a deep conversation, but a great spot to grab some food before the game."
26,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,3/23/2018,"I stopped by to get a reasonably priced meal before I went to the TD Garden for a Celtics game and I got what I expected. What I expect from a neighborhood pizza / sandwich shop is  cheap prices, plenty of food, and greezy goodness. The staff was nice, the restaurant was clean and I got my food quickly. I'll be back and  you should check this place out."
27,Halftime Pizza,2 star rating,2/21/2017,"Below average pizza, even worse service. 

Here is the breakdown:

1. Served me pizza on wax paper on a tray without a plate. Now, I'm not a decadent man, nor am I pretentious, but I could have sworn every customer since the dawn of time received thwir pozza ona paper plate if they ate in the pizzeria.

2. On the outside it said, ""worlds best pizza"". Normally I'm not this gullible but the decor was good so I was expecting at least ""worlds average pizza"" sadly...I was wrong. 

3. The surly cashier snatched my money put of my hand without making eye contact. This was ome of the worst parts of my experience.

Wont be back."
28,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,11/13/2018,"Can't go wrong when in the area. Excellent pies and beer. Great selection to choose from and plenty of other options like grinders and pasta. The negative reviews are not even close to accurate, put that aside and make this place a regular. Whether before or after a game or just in the area halftime is a go to stop."
29,Halftime Pizza,1 star rating,10/6/2018,"DISGUSTING. My family ordered a pizza whilst on vacation, and I wasn't very hungry but decided to have a piece. I took one bite, and was horrified to find that it tasted so similar to puke that I wasn't sure if I'd bitten into pizza or if I'd thrown up in my mouth. I found out that they used mainly parmasean cheese. WHO MAKES A PIZZA WITH PARMESAN CHEESE. AND the bottom was scorched! Horrific and over-priced!"
30,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,10/19/2014,"had a recent visit here with the boyfriend.  i'd issue a lower rating, but that's just based on my preferences, which are not the fault of this establishment.  they make what they make, and i wouldn't expect to be catered to here.  i think for the majority of people- this place is probably a winner.

we'd walked about a million (okay- 6) miles that day, and were awaiting a performance of the circus at TD Garden.  in desperate need of seats and food, we settled on this spot, which is literally directly across the street.

while there are sandwiches and salads on the menu, this place is known for its pizza.  the boyfriend went with 2 slices of pepperoni, i had 2 slices of cheese.  now, i'm used to ordering slices.  usually, when i do, those slices go into the oven for a ""refresher"" cooking.  not these.  off the tin, and on to your tray.  the good news is, this place is busy enough that your pie is largely fresh.  the bad news?  greasy as all get-out.  for my two slices, i used 12 napkins- all of which were saturated.  i was ready to leave at that point, but after spending the money, decided to screw it and start eating sensibly another day.

if you're not health conscious, and you're in the mood for fast and tasty enough, you'll be happy.  beers come in 16 and 32 oz. portions, for way cheaper than you can get at TD Garden.  my advice is to come here first, and then head over for your event.

and, hey- i guess if you've walked 6 miles first, the calorie count can't be too bad..."
31,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,3/14/2019,It's just really good pizza. The only good pizza in Boston. Or New England for that matter. Pretty close to New York pizza if you ask me.
32,Halftime Pizza,2 star rating,8/11/2018,"This place is not very good. The only reason I'm giving it 2 starts is because the decor was awesome. A lot of Celtics memorabilia, the pizza was cold, not very tasty, and the dude handing out the pizza was extremely rude. The only convenience I see, is that it's right across TD garden. I'd eat elsewhere."
33,Halftime Pizza,1 star rating,9/13/2019,"I got a chicken salad sub. There was no flavor and so processed that I really don't know if there was chicken in it. If I were blindfolded, I wouldn't be able to identify what the sandwich was, that's how bland it was."
34,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,1/31/2019,"not worth the hype . The slices are huge but they are very mediocre. The cheese is salty and will leave u thirsty for hours. 

If your in the area walk the extra 5 mins to the north end  and you will get A better slice at any establishment you enter"
35,Halftime Pizza,1 star rating,2/8/2016,"Absolutely TERRIBLE restaurant. The managers, employee, and workers are all extremely misogynistic and vehemently rude. They sneered, joked, and made comments about my friends and I while we were inside. Made me super uncomfortable. They were just absolute assholes. 

Their food was greasy and not even tasty, even on an empty stomach. Absolutely disgusting, wish I had my money back. 

Avoid this place at all costs. Do NOT go there or order from them."
36,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,4/16/2014,"Crispy Delicious Pizza!

This past weekend, my husband was hungry late night (after a Celtics game and a few drinks in the area), so we stopped at halftime pizza on the way home.  The place is nothing fancy, just your traditional quick grab and go (or stay) pizza place.  However, I wanted to give them a shout out on yelp, because when I took a bite of my husband's pizza I was very impressed with how flavorful and crispy it was!  I also was impressed that the size of the slices were generous (they cut 6 slices to the pie when you order it by the slice).  Price wise, the place was reasonable, we paid under $9 for two big slices (one cheese, one pepperoni) and a bottle of water.

I would definitely recommend this place for a tasty and crispy slice of pizza before or after a game.  I would imagine they get pretty crowded before games and at dinner time, but when we went it was almost empty."
37,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,1/20/2016,"Halftime Pizza is fun because it feels like you just entered back into your middle school days - with giant pints of beer.

Good pre-game before Bruins or Celtics games."
38,Halftime Pizza,1 star rating,2/5/2019,"Today I went into Halftime Pizza after the Patriots Parade to use the bathroom and I planned on getting a slice of pizza after. I quickly realized I would not be purchasing anything from these people. To me and probably many people, it's totally normal for a friend to come into the bathroom with me. After seconds of being in the bathroom, I was threatened to have the cops called on my by a homophobic woman named Nancy if one of us didn't exit the stall. She proceeded to call us monkeys, said that we should be chained up, that we weren't normal, and that our mothers should be disgusted in us. This woman threw a fit and embarrassed me in front of the entire restaurant simply because my friend and I went in the same stall together (A NORMAL GIRL THING). I'm disgusted that this behavior still exists in 2019."
39,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,12/1/2015,"Their huge greasy pizza is delicious. Some hate greasy pizza, but unfortunately (for my weight) I'm a fan and I also live unfortunately close to this place.  

Their hours aren't exactly what are posted here on Yelp.  Their schedule at night actually revolves around the schedule of events at TD Garden.  As far their hours as during the day, I'm not sure.  It almost seems random--when I walk past and get a whiff of that heavenly intoxicating pizza smell, it takes an act of God to keep me from running inside for a slice.  Think of Monterrey Jack on Chip n Dale's Rescue Rangers when he smells cheese and his body levitates toward it nose-first.

For the freshest slice, either go during a Garden event when it's busy or buy the whole pie (if you have a big group because these pizzas are a generous 22"").  I went once when they were open at lunch and had to pop my slice in the microwave before eating because they tossed it straight from the glass it was sitting under (no heat lamps) into the paper to-go bag.  Lots of other places will at least bake the room-temp slice back to health.  I think even for the whole pie orders they don't really make them fresh, depending on what you get.  They don't really seem to do custom ""add your own toppings"" type pizzas.  They have cheese, pepperoni, and one called a ""power play"" (bacon, sausage, pepperoni, onion).  Makes sense... they want to keep their customer turnover fast so they keep their pizza simple.  They also have other menu items like hot subs and salads, but I haven't tried them.

Prices are reasonable ...for the location.  I find myself saying that a lot in Boston.  I think a single pepperoni slice costs $3 or so.  The whole 22"" costs $21 and I believe it's cut in 8 slices.  So, if you're with a group or taking it to-go you'll basically get 1 free slice out of buying the whole pizza.  I'll be back, more times than my waistline wants me to."
40,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,9/16/2016,"Such good pizza and sandwiches here.

It's fantastic to be able to get high quality food in a hurry on your way into a Garden event. They don't mess around, you don't wait around. Just great pies!"
41,Halftime Pizza,1 star rating,11/29/2017,"Seriously?  I was just charged $16.10 for a beer and a small slice of cold pepperoni pizza? This place sucks. In Philly, I could get 2 slices for $3.50 and pay the same for a beer and it would STILL BE LESS THAN HALF THAT! Never again."
42,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,12/7/2017,It's a must visit place for pizza and 32oz beer before a Celtic game. They are always efficient and help make the lines move quickly. Get there early to get a table.
43,Halftime Pizza,2 star rating,9/9/2019,Nothing to write home about as far as quality and taste. Good size slices. They close around 2pm. Not the friendliest of staff. It was food.
44,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,4/18/2017,"We had a great time at halftime pizza tonight. We came out from Oregon for the marathon and were treated like royalty. Rita, Nancy, Natalie and everyone was incredibly warm and welcoming to us. The pizza was outstanding!  We will definitely be back next year!"
45,Halftime Pizza,1 star rating,11/17/2018,"They use cheddar cheese, this place does not have real pizza. Makes me sick. If you're a New Yorker, i guarantee you will be disappointed. If you're from Massachusetts, you'll think it's a ""serviceable slice""."
46,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,2/26/2018,"I'm sitting here right now posting this review. I thought I'd lost my Celtics ticket but some kind souls recovered it for me. Not only that, but despite being busy the workers listened to my plight and offered advice to help me out. Then, when my beer and water were accidentally cleaned up when I frantically stepped away, they got me a new beer (I didn't tell them about the water). Really thankful for the niceness all around and could not recommend this place higher."
47,Halftime Pizza,1 star rating,10/27/2018,"Oh man. This pizza is way below sub-par. The crust is burnt, the service is horrible and the pizza tastes like it came straight off of a construction sight. DO NOT get pizza from this place...I repeat this pizza place is horrible and their night staff are straight doo-doo. I've never had pizza this bad in Boston before and I can't believe it would come so close to the heart of Boston. I am ashamed to call myself a Bostonian with this shit pizza. This pizza would do better service as asphalt then pizza. I kid you not. Don't even bother..."
48,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,3/31/2016,"Great roast beef, chicken parm and huge slices of pizza! Great value. Worth ever penny! 
  Right across the street from the TD Garden and train."
49,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,2/25/2016,"This place is meant for somewhere to go before any event in the Garden. The place inside is all decked out in Boston sports pictures and a great atmosphere for a sports place. The pizza is great, and the Beer is cheap. Large slices, extra large beers, perfect place to stop in before a Celtics game. It's ALWAYS packed before a game so expect a wait for a table. 

This isn't the place to go to expect a sitdown meal, you come in, eat and drink, and leave to get into the Garden"
50,Halftime Pizza,2 star rating,6/24/2014,"Sorry Yelpers and sports fans, but close proximity to the Garden doesn't equal quality. I think this is one of those places almost everyone in Boston has been to. It's dirty and crowded and you move in conveyor belt fashion towards your subpar and overpriced slice. The staff is stereotypical Bostonian ""dude guys"" and couldn't care less about quality, just speed. 

You know what you're in for going in, a quick pizza and beer fix for the unwashed Boston sports masses. I'd far rather find a decent place somewhere anytime I'm in the city with so many options, but they do what they do well. It's just that what they do sucks. Proof positive that location is everything."
51,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,1/17/2018,"Good spot to grab a slice before or after a Bruins or Celtics game.  Classic pizza shop style setting.  Big bonus points for beers on draft, but the pizza is just OK."
52,Halftime Pizza,1 star rating,7/13/2006,"Place is disgusting.  I'm talking about the Halftime pizza adjacent to Friend Street.  The place is filled with little gnats that, when they smell your pizza will totally annoy you to the point of wanting to break something.  

I even sat some place else and the damn gnats followed me.  I finished the pizza and only had beer.  The damn gnats even tried to hover inside my beer.

The pizza is cardboard and cheese.  Pretty lousy.  The only positive is that it's been an hour and I still have not gotten sick."
53,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,3/27/2011,"While I visit here often I like the pizza but feel the men behind the counter really are hardened assholes. Maybe it's cause I think they are all imported from some foreign country and shouldn't be here cause they are illegal but they are Italian posers and just are plain old rude! The funny thing is the women here are great and the complete opposite of the men. The women are authentic!

The pizza is ok, not as good as Regina or even Ernesto's but it's ok pizza. The place is clean and large and the male employees are just rude. If you have time it's worth it to go into the North End for better."
54,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,11/2/2017,10/10 would recommend. We love the pizza and large beers! We come here before any event at The Garden.
55,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,10/15/2017,The staff is always nice and i been around many times so if u want a great place to have good food quick and u want pizza and beer then this ia the place for u the pizza price is a bit pricey but its worth it.
56,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,3/5/2015,"So, I have been coming here for years. It's a great alternative to spending money at the garden. You come here for the beer. The beer selection is good and cheap. 

The pizza mediocre at best. I feel like they put as little of sauce and cheese to make a pizza. Gamedays, there are literally no seats, people are eating their meals on the trash cans.,

Cheap beer, but you will not find a table before."
57,Halftime Pizza,1 star rating,1/11/2016,"Hands down winner of the worst Pizza in the world (and I've lived in some places on the west coast where there isn't much to be found in the way of delicious Pizza).

Not to mention this place looks like Chuck E Cheese inside.

If you're looking for a slice before a game, check out Crazy Dough's inside North Station. There is also plenty of decent bar food in the immediate area. All of better than this."
58,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,10/18/2013,"I actually like the pizza here. We came on a Friday night before heading to the Garden.
Two slices for me were nice and hot. Simple sauce, cheese and a toasty crust. The ziti with meatballs for my husband weren't that bad.

All in all, affordable, plenty of seating and clean bathrooms. In Boston, all of those traits can be rare."
59,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,2/21/2017,"LOVE THIS PLACE. The pizza is traditional and very good. My Husband is from NYC and he says it's the best! It is my daughters favorite Pizza joint. We visited last Christmas, we live in TX but die hard NE fans. Before the Celtics game we went to have a pie. My daughter wanted a shirt to show her friends in TX that Halftime Pizza was the best. They did not sell any however the owner heard me ask. She told me to leave my address that she would send her one when she ordered new shirt for the staff. It arrived today.Service like this and loyalty to their customers, even ones 2000 miles away, deserve loyalty from us. You will not regret it!"
60,Halftime Pizza,2 star rating,11/20/2015,"Not a fan of the greasebomb pizza they sell here. The place around the corner, Nonno's Pizza blows it out of the water. Anyone who is here claiming this is great pizza must also like the ""Celeste Pizza for 1"". Do yourself a favor and stroll down the street to Nonno's for Pizza. Come here for cheap beers only!"
61,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,1/15/2017,"Was here yesterday for the Bruins game and they have great pizza, nothing too fancy, but it was very good to eat. The beer was good as well, and I like the fact that they have 32 oz beers, you have one of those and your ready to go when you go inside for a good game. Overall, I liked my experience there and it'll be somewhere I will go to again"
62,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,12/9/2016,First time here great buffalo chicken pizza.  Thin crust very good.  Quick service on the way to the Celtics
63,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,3/10/2008,"I wish I could give it 3.5 stars but that's impossible and because I am of a generous nature 4 stars will have to do. 

The only reason I like this place is because it has become a tradition for me and my friend Dave to hit this place up for a slice of pizza and a beer before we had to Bruins or Celtics game at the TD Banknorth Garden which is across the street from this joint. And because we go to many, many, many games, I end up in this place multiple times per month. 

The atmosphere isn't the greatest although it does feel very... classic. Think of what a dive kind of bar is and give it a pizza joint twist and you'll end up with this place. Nothing can really describe it. The staff isn't friendly at all, which is typical of a such a place, especially in Boston and their pizza has nothing special, but their convenience and seating makes up for it. And they have beer. 

This place beats buying $7 pizza in the TD Banknorth so if you want to save money and grab a quick slice then this is the place to go to."
64,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,2/19/2009,"I always tell people, if I could change one thing about Boston, I'd switch locations of Fenway Park with the TD BankNorth Garden. When I go to a Bruins/Celtics game, I go for the cheap, drunk route. Immature? perhaps. Yah-Dude-esque? No doubt. However, let's be honest; When you're paying the prices we do to get to a game, you optimize the experience as best you can. 

I love walking out of the North Station T-Stop, across the street to Sully's, drinking my way through the other end, out the door and turn right. Into Halftime Pizza. I can't remember if the workers are  mean or rude; I'm usually sporting a pretty good buzz. They sell 22 ounce beers with your pizza, and both are a lot cheaper than you'd pay inside the Garden. Wolf down a couple slices with a couple tall beers, and you'll save yourself a ton of money inside the Garden. 

After the game, the buzz lightens up, you retrace your steps. If Fenway had this set up, life would be perfect."
65,Halftime Pizza,2 star rating,5/7/2015,"Nice people.  Pizza poor.  Probably great when drinking and going to theTD  Garden

but I was sober and the pizza was a little not tasty, did not finish"
66,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,3/27/2014,Great thin crest pizza and decent cheese. A good place to stop before heading over to the Garden for a game or concert. Beer prices are good also.
67,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,4/28/2013,"Two words: wicked awesome.

I've walked past this place dozens of times, and never stopped in. Today, I have realized everything I've been missing out on. My friend and I were wanting some game day food before going to the Bruins game, and with a 30 minute wait at all the sports bars down the street, that wasn't going to happen. We just so happened to pass this place again, and decided to stop in.

There was a staff member directing traffic through the shop; this place was PACKED.  If he hadn't been there directing us to the less crowded back area, we never would have known where to go. Once there, our wait in line was surprisingly short for the volume of people entering and finagling their way through the aisles with their food and brews. We were greeted by a very friendly cashier, and our food and drinks were up within 1 minute of ordering. We managed to secure prime real estate (a booth), and ended up sharing with a group of strangers. I digress, but we made some new friends and heard a bunch of hilarious stories. Thanks Halftime for bringing us together!

The food itself is a great value for the price. For around $3 and some change, I got a generous slice of pepperoni pizza, , and my friend got her slice of cheese for a little less. We both ordered a beer as well. My Coors Light (20 ounce) was only $5.25, and her Blue Moon (20 ounce) was $6.25. Try getting beer that cheap in the Garden, you won't find t! We ended up ordering another slice each, and the staff offered another slice on the house for mine being smaller than normal. We left full and happy, and our wallets were happy too.

The food quality was good as well. For a shop catering to the game day rush, the turnout of their food was quick, and we both got fresh slices. The crust was not too thin or thick, and it was quite delicious. They didn't skimp on the toppings either, and the cheese wasn't rubbery or waterlogged with grease. My stomach approves of this place, and will definitely be making trip number two as soon as possible."
68,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,7/26/2018,"Skip the loooong wait at Fours on game night and grab a couple slices and a cold beer at Halftime. Good pizza, fast service, old school atmosphere is the perfect pregame for a C's or B's game. Meatball sub is pretty good too. I do miss the hockey fight reels on the TVs though."
69,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,6/18/2018,"Great place for pizza before a TD garden event! Air conditioned with plenty of seating.  You can get slices ready made. We happen to order a large cheese just as it was coming out of the oven. I highly recommend this pizza place for a casual, kid friendly restaurant."
70,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,9/26/2015,"Decent pizza...but come here for the giant beers! Right across from TD garden so pounding a few of these guys before coming in will save you the long expensive wait in line at the venue. Perfect before a Bruins game. Grab a few slices, beer and be on your way!"
71,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,5/2/2015,"No thrills or frills. If you want a nice large slice before or after a game, you go here. As native New Jersey kids, we know a good slice, and this place has them."
72,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,10/19/2015,"Great pizza although I'd prefer fresh slice verses heated up slices, I'm a NY Pizza eater, this is very close to that, people who take your order aren't very pleasant, maybe it's cause the Red Sox suck,   I don't know, but it's kind of a turn off with this place, lots of pizza in Boston, like other busy places they figure bad  guest experience won't hurt because of high volume, NEWS FLASH , it will catch up to you. Shame cause the pizza is really good."
73,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,11/22/2013,"I came here for lunch the other day after walking by this place for many years and not EVER wanting to go inside and try it out.  I finally did and I was SHOCKED at how decent the pizza was here.  I mean, don't expect 5 star stuff, but overall I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of pizza.  To me, it reminds me of Nino's over on Charles St, except possibly a bit better.  

Cheese slices for 2.25, not bad.  Always freshly made and they also serve beer which is kind of cool in its own way.  Now that I've been to this spot, I might start hitting it hard before Bruins games, so I don't spend my life fortune for food in the Garden.  Lots of space inside also was a real surprise."
74,Halftime Pizza,1 star rating,3/8/2017,"If you like reheated pizza this is place to go. All the pizza by the slice is premade and reheated. Got a slice of cheese and pepperoni. While the restaurant was packed, the pizza was cold and tasteless. $8 for 2 awful slices. First and last time stopping here."
75,Halftime Pizza,2 star rating,3/7/2015,First off the pizza is over priced and not good at all..very limited on there drinks...who doesn't have ginger ale these days! Never again!
76,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,3/26/2016,Quick pizza spot before a Bruins game or Celtics game.  They sell average pizza.  Have never ordered any other food from their menu.  What keeps me coming back is the 32oz Coors Light for $8.95.
77,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,2/5/2016,"I love to come here when I don't have a lot of time before a Celtics game. Great atmosphere for a pizza joint and the pizza is good. Prices aren't bad, beers are huge and it's right outside the Garden. If you are in the mood for pizza and want a quick bite before a game, I would recommend. Obviously lots of bars around but if you don't have a lot of time, check it out."
78,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,1/9/2018,Went in on a night when there wasn't a game. It was around 5:30. I was informed before I ordered that they only had cheese pizza. I was disappointed but had a slice anyway. It was a large slice and had a nice crisp crust and good flavor. Overall fair value and flavor for the money.
79,Halftime Pizza,2 star rating,10/2/2015,Pizza slice just wasn't great. I asked for a single slice and they said my only options were pepperoni or cheese. I selected pepperoni. The pizza looked and tasted a little old. Bottom was burnt. Just not very much taste. Works as a cheap lunch I suppose.
80,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,1/15/2008,"I stopped in here during my lunch break.  Definitely sketch, and the owners were kinda rude, but the pizza was good and it was quick!

It did the trick, although, I won't be going out of my way to get a slice!

No gnats."
81,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,10/30/2017,"Get your 2 slices of pizza and giant beer, eat it, go the the bruins game. The pizza isn't that great but whatever location location location the pizza hits the spot."
82,Halftime Pizza,2 star rating,3/8/2014,Staff is rude...and pizza is mediocre. What makes this place is bad is 7 bucks for a draft beer in a plastic cup really? That is the same price they charge for beer in the garden. Place is crowded and noisy...and good luck trying to find a seat in this place .staff is all about the green here...and no I am not talkin about Celtic pride.
83,Halftime Pizza,3 star rating,5/19/2010,"Visually, this pizza appeals to me. A nice sized slice of thin crust, NY style pizza. 

Texturally (yes, it's a word. I checked), this pizza appeals to me. Thin crust yet still chewy. Not oily or soggy. 

All positives.

Taste-wise, this pizza is lacking. The tomato sauce has no flavor. I don't even think there's any salt in it. And the cheese, though it melts nicely and gets bubbly, is also virtually flavorless. 

If doused in salt & crushed red pepper, a slice of this pizza can be mildly satisfying."
84,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,10/4/2015,"Went here one night with the family before going to the TD Garden and ordered 2 pizzas which were huge , had a few of the 32 oz. Goodnight Irene drought beers ... place had really good pizza and some decent beer on tap , service was rather quick and beer was super cold and i loved the pizza ..... good place definitely a good spot to grab a few beers and a quick bite ...... i was really foggy that night but i didn't forget this place .....i will be back next time i'm in Bean town and near the Garden !"
85,Halftime Pizza,5 star rating,1/31/2015,Amazing pizza. I recommend going here before a game instead of buying TD Garden food. This is cheaper and better (except Legends is really good but is much more upscale.) This has a real Boston sports atmosphere that you can't get anywhere else except Boston. The food is so good and is cheap too. Must visit if in the area.
86,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,4/28/2015,"I've been coming here for a long time, be it before a game or for lunch I'd recommend it for either. Their slice is good, always a safe bet and the beer is very reasonable. Its crowded at before evens, but what isn't around the area at that time, they move you quickly and efficiently with out any significant sacrifices to quality."
87,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,8/27/2011,"I used to eat her ein the early 90's when I went to Bruins games at the old Garden.  Visited there recently to reminisce.  The pizza is the closest thing Boston has to New York style.  It's consistently good, even 20 years later."
88,Halftime Pizza,2 star rating,3/21/2009,"Expensive pizza that really isn't all that good.

If you come here on a Celtics/Bruins game day/night prepare for massive lines and a neverending search for a table or place to stand.

Pizza is like $2.50-2.75 a slice and sucks.  The draft beer is the only decent thing about this place.  If it wasn't for it's location it would probably go out of buisness.

Take your money and hit up The Fours or Hurricane O'Riley's."
89,Halftime Pizza,4 star rating,1/17/2015,"I've been coming to Halftime since I was a little kid, the place is an institution and a must go before any event at the Garden.  I've always enjoyed the pictures on the ceilings, brings back a lot of memories of Boston sports.  The pizza is great; greasy but too much and the slices are a really good size as well.  The atmosphere at times can be a little tense as some of the staff can give off the vibe of wanting verbal confrontations with customers."
0,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,3/24/2022,"The cookies are palm sized but they're so good!!! 
I recommend swinging by if your in the area, it'll be worth it. 

No one in my office knew about the place but they know now"
1,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,8/29/2021,"There's something about getting a dozen of mini cookies from the Chipyard whenever I visit Fanueil Hall. There's just so gosh darn good. They're out of this world if you can get them straight out of the oven. Crispy edges, soft middle, and the right amount of chocolate chips. $10 for a dozen, guess covid's made them raise their prices^^^. Watched the price go up over the years but as tradition and as acting quality control, I highly recommend you get some.

There's also oatmeal raisin and peanut butter chocolate chip. Service was quick and they take cash and card."
2,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,8/22/2021,"The peanut-butter chocolate chip were not very peanut buttery.  The chocolate chocolate chip were good, but the best of the three types we had RP were the classic chocolate chip cookies. Buttery fall apart in your hands (even the next day) and a good chocolate chip ratio."
3,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,8/21/2020,"Stopped by Chipyard to try out some cookies during a walk around Boston. I'm not sure if they have recently raised the prices of the cookies but we paid $7 for half a dozen cookies. Which seems like a lot especially after reading other reviews.

The chocolate chip cookies themselves are pretty bite size but we're tasty and homemade. They were a bit crunchy on the outside but chewy on the inside. Nothing out of this world but they reminded me of the cookies I would make at home with my mom as a kid."
4,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,3/30/2021,I really wanted warm cookies and I found some. Some were warm and some weren't but they were still good. My favorite was banana chocolate chip.
5,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,8/22/2021,"Stopped by here because we were drawn in by the smell. Cookies were tiny and overpriced. We got chocolate chip that did taste homemade, but Nestle cookies at home are better"
6,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,8/28/2019,"The cookies are kinda small like Mrs. Fields sized. I bought two dozen to take home and packed them carefully in my bag on the plane for souvenir but they survived. But be wary, these cookies really crumble and they are best eaten on the spot. I believe they do sell time cans for take home but I didnt want to pay extra. Nonetheless, they were yummy. Great plain classic cookie recipe that would pair well with a large cup of milk."
7,The Boston Chipyard,1 star rating,8/3/2021,"disappointed, came a long way to a supposedly open store waited 30min.. nobody there. the cookies were out and tip jar.. no sign was out.. not safe for food.. the vendor next door said they had no idea were they were.. sry can blame that on covid-19.."
8,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,5/30/2019,"I came by on a Saturday night at around 9:30 for dessert. They only had two kinds of cookies as the others had run out which is disappointing because they close at 12am on Saturday nights. I just wanted a cookie or two but since they don't sell them individually, I had to get half a dozen. I got the oatmeal raisin which were delicious!

I would be hesitant to come back for sure. First, they didn't have a wide selection available. Second, you have to buy so many instead of individually. Third, it was pretty pricey for the size of the cookies. I might stop again if I was already at the marketplace, but it's definitely not a place I would seek out"
9,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,12/6/2019,"Always enjoyed grabbing a bag of cookies when roaming faneuil hall. Delicious, warm, and melt in your mouth goodness. There are several flavors to choose from and I dont think you can go wrong."
10,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,8/1/2018,"Get the original chocolate chip cookies! It's so addictively good! Especially when they're fresh out of the oven! Soft and chewy center with a slight outer crunch. Not too sweet and perfect amount of chocolate chips. Found out they originated from California. Go figure we come all the way to Boston just to fall in love with food in our own backyard 

1/2 dozen for $7
1 Dozen for $8
2 dozen for $16"
11,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,7/30/2020,"I've always loved Chipyard, since middle school.
I ordered some oatmeal chocolate chip and I got oatmeal raisin."
12,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,8/4/2019,A good cookie - small and chewy. You can get a dozen for $8 which is the way to go. Great location in the Faneuil market. Go for the classic chocolate chip!
13,The Boston Chipyard,2 star rating,4/3/2018,"This place use to be my favorite place for chocolate chip cookies. They use to be so perfect but the quality and size have gone down in recent years and price has gone up. 

I recently bought a batch of a dozen traditional chocolate chip cookies. First, let's talk about the experience ordering them, no one on line in front of us, and the guy behind the counter saw us, but ignored us.... carried on as if we weren't there. It would have been fine if he had at the very least greeted us and said please wait a minute but it's another to completely ignore us. 

The cookies we got were so small... smaller than the size of my palm. The cookies were overly hard and crispy, they use to be perfectly melt in your mouth in the middle and crispy on the edges. But now it's just hard and unpleasant for my teeth. It is also more sweet now and not subtle sweetness with delicious cookie batter. I can shrug this off and say that this was just a bad batch but it doesn't really seem worth it anymore.... for such small cookies... for $7/dozen... seems a little high for me. 

I would recommend going to sofra in Cambridge to get their chocolate chip cookies instead..."
14,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,1/6/2020,"$8 for a dozen mini cookies. Tried the chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, chocolate fudge and peanut butter. Expensive for the size of the cookies, but it's a nice treat one in a while."
15,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,10/16/2016,"The smell of baking cookies drew me over to this stall on a cool drizzly day. I wanted something sweet after the lobster roll and chowder we had for lunch so I decided to grab some cookies. For a dozen little cookies, it came out to around $7. I tried he chocolate chip and chocolate fudge (I think it was called that??). Both were delicious! It was soft and chewy on the inside but also still had a little crispness on the outside....the way I like my cookies! Wish I had milk (or lactaid in my case)!! I would def get cookies from here again. Pricing is cheaper than Mrs Fields and it's super tasty!"
16,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,1/3/2017,"It's in Faneuil Hall. Pricing is not bad but keep in mind the cookies are not the same shape as a normal cookie, they are much smaller! Flavors range from oatmeal to chocolate chip, macadamia nuts. Service is average! Cookies are not all cooked round or evenly if you will but still worth a try!"
17,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,1/1/2017,"This place sells variations of a chocolate chip cookie. I tried the fudge chip cookie, pistachio, walnut, and mint. The texture of the cookie was great: crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My favorite flavor was the pistachio; least favorite was the mint. Overall, I think it's pretty expensive for the size of these cookies. I bought 6 cookies for 5 dollars but these cookies are literally bite size. It's great if you want to try multiple flavors but it's almost a dollar for a bite."
18,The Boston Chipyard,1 star rating,7/22/2018,Huge disappointment. Cold tiny tiny cookies. I was given the wrong flavor. Wanted peanut butter chocolate chip and was given fudge. No consistency with sizing of the cookies. Cookies were way to small for $8 a dozen. The oatmeal cookie had no flavor and was undercook. I think this is just a tourist trap. I'm from out of the area but I'm sure you can get a better bigger cookie elsewhere. Don't waste your time at the Chipyard.
19,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,11/21/2018,"A local icon. Buttery cookies. Fresh cold milk. 

This place has been here for years for a reason and is definitely worth a visit!"
20,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,4/10/2017,This place is awesome and has been at Faneuil Hall for as long as I can remember. The cookies are delicious and are bite sized and baked just right. They charge $7 for a half dozen and for $1 more you can get a full dozen so it's definitely worth it to go all out and get the dozen. They have several varieties available and I opted for the pistachio chocolate chip cookies. The service is great and very friendly. Highly recommended.
21,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,6/13/2017,Cookies aren't as good as they used to be and the price went up $7 for a dozen. The cookies are much smaller...some are half the size of what used to be. Very inconsistent. I had a chocolate chip about 2 inches big and another that was about 1 inch. You can see in the picture. The fudge is still delicious but I hate that it is so small. The oatmeal reason is not good anymore. It used to be chewy and flavorful and now it is hard without much taste.
22,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,12/22/2017,"Boston Chipyard has the patience of a saint. 
Placed a very large order and there was a miscommunication in delivery date and Dana made everything right.  Not only that, but everyone LOVED the cookies.  Thanks Dana for making many people happy this holiday season."
23,The Boston Chipyard,2 star rating,10/15/2018,Completely inconsistent sizes. Some of my cookies were the size of a quarter when others were about the size of my palm(not huge but regular cookie sized) I ordered 12 for $8 but felt like I got ripped off when half of them were super tiny and half were normal sized. The flavor itself was good but I didn't like the inconsistency and don't think that's right when you are paying for 12 cookies that all vary in size. Also the man working was very condescending in the way he spoke to me and rushed me while I decided which type of cookies I wanted to get.
24,The Boston Chipyard,2 star rating,9/24/2018,"This is a childhood staple of mine and after coming here for much longer than I can remember, I can say I was absolutely troubled by my most recent experience there. 

I'll start by saying that these cookies have a 5 star quality. This isn't about the cookies.

On Sunday, Sept 16, at approximately 7:45 PM, I waited in line behind a Muslim family of 3, two women and a child, who were struggling to pay for the cookies with both cash and card. Their card was being declined. The child was distraught. It was hard to watch. As they were being shooed away, I ordered a dozen cookies, and asked the man at the counter how much they were short, implying I would be happy to pay. He said to me ""don't worry about it, kid. I've been around the block...they have the money"", implying that they were trying to rip him off, shooing them away. 

These sorts of things take a while to sink in for me, but I stuck around to see if anything more were to happen. It didn't. I spoke to the woman at the cart next door saying that this particular cashier is always like that.  
Fire that cashier, whomever he was."
25,The Boston Chipyard,1 star rating,11/21/2014,"I think it's safe to say that I have a sweet tooth...okay, fine, maybe more like 28! (I don't have any wisdom teeth lol) That being said, I've had my fair share of desserts so naturally, I would be inclined to pick up some cookies as I'm taking a stroll through Quincy Market one evening. I got 1/2 a dozen for $4...a dozen is only $2 more (but before you get excited about the bargain, you should know that I would have rather picked up some Pepperidge Farm Milano Cookies from a local grocery store instead). 

With 6 different cookies, you'd think I was bound to like one! Sadly, that wasn't the case. I tried the traditional chocolate chip, walnut chocolate chip, oatmeal, banana chocolate chip, and macadamia chocolate chip. If you're wondering why I only mentioned five, it's because I purchased two walnut chocolate chip. The cookies are about an inch and a half in diameter so they're a perfect size for snacking and sharing but if you do decide to share them just know that you'll be sharing tasteless calories...I honestly wasn't impressed. Maybe I was just there on an off day but the service is subpar too. I wish I could have given this place a sweeter review."
26,The Boston Chipyard,2 star rating,1/27/2019,"Bought a dozen cookies for $8 today. They're small, but the oatmeal raisin cookies that I was given were barely larger than a quarter. If you're going to be given a one-bite cookie, it should be 2 for 1. Disappointing. Won't be back."
27,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,5/1/2016,"Super cute name! The cookies are 6 for $5 or 12 for $7... so for $2 more you get double the cookies! I bit my tongue and opted for the 6 cookies instead. Don't get me wrong, one could easily devour 12 of these bite-size cookies, but I felt like I'd be cheating on my post-breakup self if I ate post-breakup portions outside of post-breakup breakups. Ummm, yeah.

So this gets 3 stars from me because the batch I got were not soft, chewy, and freshly made. They were on the display for far too long and were hard and dry. I did like the flavors I got (pistachio and fudge), so that's a bummer that I didn't get to enjoy them while they were still fresh.

The lady at the counter was nice though! I asked to try the pistachio and said it would count towards my 6, but she ended up giving me 6 more anyway.

I would definitely come back but I'd ask for a fresh batch or wait until they had a freshly made batch."
28,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,3/20/2018,Ok whoever says size doesn't matter obviously wasn't talking about chocolate chip cookies that's for damn sure !!! I used to be in Faneuil Hall all the time used to hang around JJ Donavan's and other establishments so was constantly at the Chipyard and although the cookies taste the same the size have gotten incredibly smaller. They're now one biters as evidenced by my videos and as disheartening as the size is it's the taste and texture that still has me hooked. I've never been able to be in the area without stopping into The Chipyard for cookies and I'll always eat some there and bring at least 3-4 dozen home in one of their tins. Although my favorites are the chocolate chip cookies the oatmeal raisin peanut butter and peanut butter are all great too. I've never tried the fudge chocolate chip but will for sure next visit. The only drawback is the size and price is a bit steep although I gues you get what you pay for but I still wish they were bigger because I could easily eat 2-3 dozen as I ate a dozen this visit while there like breaking sticks and took 3 dozen home and could've easily broken into those on ride home. Even though they're smaller than I remember the taste is same so it's definitely worth a stop if your in area. The same guy owns it since when I used to go in years ago he's always working there nice hardworking guy. He's a hands on owner I wish I remembered his name very nice guy
29,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,12/3/2016,"The cookies are freaking fantastic!
We had the classic choc chip, peanut butter, and oatmeal raisin.
Damn delicious!!  Go for it!"
30,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,12/3/2018,"Good bite sized cookies. Tried the chocolate chip and the fudge. The double chocolate fudge is really sweet IMO, but if you have a sweet tooth and like chocolate, you might enjoy this. The chocolate chip was super good though."
31,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,10/24/2018,"We made the stop before our Haunted Boston ghost tour, tiny little homemade cookies. They were so delicious! Some were crunchy, but the flavors were so great! You don't really come by buttery little cookies like this anymore. If you're in the area, grab a few, they go great with coffee!"
32,The Boston Chipyard,2 star rating,12/7/2018,"Cookies are amazing, however we went there based on the hours advertised and it was closed. Was so sad to not have some birthday cookies!"
33,The Boston Chipyard,2 star rating,3/12/2017,"Please save your money for these tiny cookies. I got a dozen because one dozen is for $7 and $5 for half. So I got two of jalapeño, chocolate fudge, regular chocolate, oatmeal raisin and the walnut one. They are very small, cold, and hard. I would not waste my money again. Insomnia cookies are way better."
34,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,5/18/2016,"Chipyard is a must go-to during our trips to Boston. The workers aren't always the most pleasant, but the cookies make up for it. Generally always get the banana chocolate chip, but tried the pistachio chocolate chip for the first time. Game changer! Moist just like all the cookies are, but with the perfect amount of subtle pistachio taste. Wish this was always an option when we go."
35,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,10/8/2017,"This place is a must stop whenever I'm in Boston and happen to be near Faneuil Hall. The cookies are fresh and the taste is always consistent. They offer a variety of different  flavors like walnut , chocolate chip, and macadamia. The pricing is a bit expensive for the small size of the cookies but the convenience of its location seem to keep them pretty busy. It's definitely worth a stop if you are nearby and like freshly baked cookies!"
36,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,11/2/2015,"Loved the cookies here; this would not be a 5 star review if I had bought any less than a dozen (then each cookie would have been pretty darn pricey...), but for a dozen mini delicious bites, $6 is fair considering where it's located. I love the banana chip cookies, though I must say that if you get them with other types of cookies either eat them right away or put them in a separate bag because the banana flavor spreads rapidly. The peanut butter chip cookies are amazing too. 

P.S. Did you know that one of the guys who founded Chipyard is also the creator of Arrested Development?"
37,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,8/9/2015,"The Boston Chipyard is appealing in the sense that these cookies are tiny, mini, and fun-sized - definitely more of a touristy thing. I do like their range of flavors: banana chocolate chip, mint chocolate chip, coconut...you name it!

But if you're expecting a moist cookie, you're probably much better off going to a bakery or baking one at home. These ones taste mostly dry, but it's definitely an experience sampling all the fun flavors.

They sell by the dozen, I think. I bought 12 for $6.00."
38,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,6/29/2018,"We stopped here on a recommendation. Only a few choices of cookies (chocolate chip, raisin, chocolate, and peanut butter). The chocolate cookie was by far the best. I'd recommend you go earlier in the day for more choices and fresher cookies."
39,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,6/13/2016,"The absolute best cookies..... drop mic. 

Not obnoxiously big, small, just enough chips in the regular chocolate chip cookie no over powering chocolate flavor and they are not too sweet. Oatmeal raisin and Chocolate Chip Peanut Butter round out the ones this house likes. Is it a tourist trap? I guess, but what local does not go to faneuil hall in the summah? The cookies are good and they deserve your business. Online ordering is a great option too not too expensive and overnight shipping fresh to your door."
40,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,4/15/2013,"Behind the cutesy name is a simple, quick and effectively good cookie stand which sells mini cookies of all sorts at the reasonable rates of 6 for $3 or a dozen for $5.

There's seven different cookies to choose from: classic chocolate chip, chocolate chocolate chip, walnut chocolate chip, oatmeal raison chocolate chip, peanut butter chocolate cip and mint chocolate chip.

The staff is very quick and it's very hard to resist the smell of those cookies... that you can smell... throughout the entire area. Each cookie I had there was very tasty and baked to a golden yet moist perfection. Great for sharing as well as they aren't much bigger than a US dollar coin making for a great on-the-go snack or pick-me-up.

Oh and did I mention that you can mix-and-match your cookies? Sweet."
41,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,10/31/2015,"Visited this place 31 Oct 2015. They have a wide variety of cookies that are bite size. Ranging from regular chocolate chip to pumpkin chocolate chip
 
The cookies aren't anything new. But what makes this place great is the price for a dozen bite size cookies is $6. The wide variety. The alluring scent that fresh bakes cookies have and because of the high turn over... the chocolate chips are moist and gooey just like being fresh out of the oven."
42,The Boston Chipyard,2 star rating,10/18/2014,"Boo to cold and tasteless cookies that aren't worth the carbs!  What the heck is up with the mad love on Yelp?!  

Minimum purchase is 6; bought 2 each of classic choco chips, almond, coconut and choco chips and oatmeal raisin choco chips. 

All three were a bit doughy and a lot of bit not yummy.

Too bad one of the ubiquitous transients loitering by Faneuil Hall wasn't around; had to throw out the bag."
43,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,12/14/2015,"This mini cookies are tiny pieces to heaven! Served slightly warm, but baked fresh daily - these cookies are PACKED with flavor! From numerous of options it's hard to pick a flavor. Buster scotch, Oatmeal Raisin, White chocolate chip, and the originally chocolate chip. I grabbed a back to go for my plane flight back home and I had no regrets!! It's hard to miss this place especially when you get a whiff of the aroma of cookies being baked in nice crisp winter air!"
44,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,2/24/2016,Best Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie in Boston. I love their tins - bought a variety of 30 bite-size cookies for my office. Would recommend to anyone! I think they deliver too. A must-have!

If you're from out of town , like I was, it's also an easy dessert to take with you back to you lodgings or eat while you walk. The cookies are super fresh, they are being baked on site, and when you order, you are given the freshest cookies off the tray. I was given 6 warm small chocolate chip cookies for $5. There were also 4 other flavors ."

......on screen. Barely.

Not confirmed, but I've been told by a reliable source (the statue of Red Auerbach) that The Boston Chipyard chose its Quincy Market spot because their ovens are right under the HVAC intake. They pump COOKIE SMELL throughout the ENTIRE MARKET. Genius."
47,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,11/30/2016,"By far the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had. They're small, so they're even more dangerous! I killed a dozen within 2 minutes and this was after stuffing my face all day with lobster rolls and other delicious seafood. I'm going to have to come back here everyday I'm here in Boston!"
48,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,3/18/2014,"SIX cookies for $5 bucks!  We're talking small cookies here!  There are no prices anywhere so good luck trying to find any!  

The cookies are boring and unfortunately are not sweet enough!  I wish I saved my $5.00 and bought something at a North End Bakery across the street.

Staff behind the counter was NOT friendly by any means either.."
49,The Boston Chipyard,1 star rating,5/24/2016,Horrible small lazy tourist trap. 7 bucks for 12 tiny not good choc chip cookies and half them they took the name to heart bec theyre was literally one chip in them. Do urself a favor. Go inside thru the seating section and inside about 50 ft on the right ull see a place with big oversized cookies. Bought those seconds after this place. Much much happier.
50,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,1/13/2010,"When I couldn't find this place and had to call for directions the man who answered stayed on the line with me and helped me navigate my way. He did not hang up until my hand was on the door! I suspect he was the owner because who else would care that much about a random lost lady?

We were in charge of dessert on this particular evening and with the help of Yelp for iPhone, I identified The Boston Chipyard (don't ask why I wasn't also able to find the storefront with that handy device...I concede user error may have played a part.) I ate a whole lot of these petite cookies. And that's not even counting the two dozen we took with us to dinner in Melrose! I love their diminutive size and though they've got many flavors, I say stick with the usual suspects: chocolate chip and peanut butter chocolate chip."
51,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,8/9/2010,"Perhaps it was the captivating vapors stemming from a combination of butter and brown sugar.  Or it might have been the large yellow display sign.  Nevertheless, cookies are something that are never bypassed and must always be sampled.  Whether it is an initial visual observation rendered to determine purchase / sampling or the gluttonous consumption and subsequent ""eaters remorse"", cookies must and always be given their proper due diligence.

Walking into Faneuil Hall and visually inspecting the offerings of The Boston Chipyard rendered harmonious feelings of ""I've died and gone to heaven"".  With their monstrosity display of various baked contributions, it's difficult for anyone to resist the urge just to try one of their petite, 2"" diameter cookies.  

While standing in front of the counter and munching our offerings, the following observations were rendered...

Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip:  Heavy & bold in flavor, delicate and subtle in texture!  At first bite, patrons will discover that the vigorous sweetness and nuttiness derived from the cookie is the centerpiece of this application.  The controlled sweetness of the peanut butter helped to introduce the semi-sweetness of the chocolate chips.  Rounding out the application is the perfectly moist and fragile composition of the cookie.  Combined with the subtle notes of butter, brown sugar, & vanilla, the array of flavors used in the composition of Boston Chipyard's Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip cookie was resourceful and delicious!

Fudge Chocolate Chip:  Possessing more of a hearty composition and full-bodied flavor, the Fudge Chocolate Chip rendition is best described as brash & savory.  At first bite, patrons will discover the potent use of semi-sweet chocolate to be the centerpiece of the application.  The combination of the robust dark chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips help to complement one another by emphasizing the subtle sweetness with the richness of the chocolate.

So what was the lasting impression of The Boston Chipyard?  One word...  Balance!  The proper sizing and steadiness in various flavors helped to bring out a well produced rendition of the classic edible.  Perhaps a little too many of the cookies were consumed.  Nevertheless, who would deny such offerings if given the opportunity?  The best cookie I ever had in my life?  Definitely not!  But The Boston Chipyard will satisfy any individual's cooking craving."
52,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,6/12/2014,"While not the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had, they are certainly a good cookie.  We LOVED the chocolate chocolate chip and the white chocolate was pretty good too.  And for the record, the chocolate chip was tasty and felt homemade.  Some of the bitterness over the price is pretty undeserved.  While it seems a ripoff for 6 cookies, it's a great price for a dozen!  And the guy at the counter gave us an extra one also (not to mention gave us cookies right off the rack).  It's hard to beat the fact that these things are made like you would make them at home.  They don't taste processed or artificial at all.  Seriously worth a bite to satisfy your cookie craving.  Definitely should post prices though.  Don't know what that's about."
53,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,8/1/2015,"Rather than spring for a dozen, dropped a touristy/suckery $6 on their small and mediocre chipreme sandwich."
54,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,6/27/2017,"THESE ARE THE BEST HOMEMADE COOKIES IVE EVER HAD. When you take a bite of these cookies, you get the exterior crunch and the soft interior. My favorite was the chocolate walnut. The price is so good here too, I can't wait to come back!"
55,The Boston Chipyard,2 star rating,3/10/2014,"Half the cookies were stale, the rest were fine, but nothing to write home about.

Way overpriced for what they are.

Cute name and touristy location probably means the place sees a lot of business.

Hit up one of the many bakeries in North End less than a mile away from this place. You'll be glad you did!"
56,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,6/11/2012,"A group of ten or so of us slowly ate through two bags of these cute little cookies while strolling through the city. They serve as excellent treats to fuel a long walking tour of Boston. When you first get them, they are warm and gooey--just barely baked so that the edges are like fresh cookie consistency but the center is still like buttery cookie dough that leaves a significant amount of oil on your hands. They are small bites, so you can eat multiple without feeling really guilty.

Extra star for the punny-ness!"
57,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,2/13/2009,"Well here is how to have a fattening day.... go to mmmm mac and cheese then get cookies here! Thats what I did recently. And these cookies are worth the calories. 

The cookies were sooo good, esp the white chocolate macadaima nut cookies. (which from me is amazing, since i hate white chocolate!). The only cookie I thought was okay was the banana chocolate chip cookie. The banan tasted more imitation than real banana. But overall thr cookeis are fantastic. 

There was no signage for qty and price. They told us 12 for $5, so we kinda had to go with it. They need some signs!

I know I'll go back when I need a cookie fix, plus my office will enjoy some more cookies."
58,The Boston Chipyard,1 star rating,8/24/2018,"$8.00 for a dozen small, cold, average cookies. There are better places in Boston if you have a desire for fresh baked cookies. I'm disappointed by this place."
59,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,12/3/2013,"Now here's a company that prides itself on their amazing cookies, and of course, outstanding customer service.

After an unfortunate encounter (non-encounter I should say) with Kilvert and Forbes, I said...I'm going to the Chipyaahhhd. 

Delicious, scrumptious, delicate baby cookies are SO good. I bought a dozen for hubs and I to share, and he's as much in love with these babies as much as I am.

Go, and you'll be wanting a cookie from this place each time afterwards when you have a craving."
60,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,3/25/2014,"Cookies were ok but overall expensive $6 for 12 MINI-2-BITES-SIZE cookies but it did satisfy my sweets craving. They are tasty life tollhouse cookies but with less chips though just wish they were warm, the staff said he can warm them for me but by the time I decided which flavors, we both forgot. The banana chocolate chip cookie was interesting and I enjoyed it.  Cookies were just how I like them crunch with a little softness in the middle. Staff wasn't friendly actually a little rude but I made a joke about his poor attitude and he lightened up. Guess I caught him off guard! 
It's definitely a touristy spot, wouldn't visit again for myself but maybe if I was with someone who wanted to try it like family visiting."
61,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,10/26/2016,Took a walk over to get some cookies at the Boston Chipyard. Says it opens at 9 but really opens at 10.  The MARKET opens at 9...not Chipard.  Just an FYI.  Three stars because I haven't tasted the cookies yet which is the most important part.  Waiting for them to open.
62,The Boston Chipyard,2 star rating,8/27/2019,"My son and his wife went to the Chipyard at Faneuil Hall two weekends ago and bought me a half dozen of the regular chocolate chip cookies and a half dozen of the fudge (all chocolate) ones.  (They were out of the peanut butter ones (at 2:00 on a Saturday) and the mint ones (which were my first choice).  Strike one.  His wife had been there many times before, but not for a couple of years and when I told her how disappointed I was, she said she was, too.  First of all, the cookies are VERY small (about 1-1/2 toe 2"" diameter)... and six of them only weighed maaaybe 2 or 3 ounces.  And each flavor was extremely uninteresting...not at all delicious as I was hoping.  They were more like ones a child might have made having forgotten the butter, the high quality chips and a pinch of salt.  Both flavors were very bland and not at all worth the high price.  I say walk, don't run away... small un-tasty cookies aren't worth your $12.00.  (Note: in comparison, I buy a bag of huge chocolate chip cookies from Tendercrop Farm on 1A near North Beverly and they are fabulous, about 4-1/2 inches in diameter, and you get about 10 of them (the bag weighing usually about 2 pounds) for $6.99 (or maybe it's 7.99), but either way, I would drive for an hour to get them, as they are truly outstanding.  I'm lucky because they are only about a 15 minute drive from our house."
63,The Boston Chipyard,1 star rating,9/26/2016,"To say the least - the cookies do not look like the picture. 

1 dozen cookies - 3 with literally NO CHIPS, 6 with 1 or 2 chips each and 3 with more than 2 chips. The reviews clearly not a place to recommend!"
64,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,7/31/2015,"Great little cookies.  Lots of variety if you are looknig for a sweet snack.  For Faneuil Hall, I found the prices to be reasonable. Hard to eat just one!"
65,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,11/2/2015,"Ordered a large tin of cookies for my boss (a Bostonian) on his birthday. Unfortunately, though I placed the order well-before the 3:00PM cutoff for overnight shipping, the Chipyard's email system unexpectedly shuffled some stuff around and the package didn't ship until a day later. I called to complain (now that my boss's present was going to be a day late) and Dana, whom I spoke to, was immediately apologetic and even shipped DOUBLE my original order at no additional cost. I was incredibly pleased with how he handled the situation and the service I received. 

The cookies are fantastic! The people are great! This place deserves five stars. Thank you Dana and thank you Chipyard! I will certainly be ordering again..."
66,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,7/11/2015,I love their cookies especially when you go right when they open and just are making them. However they are kinda expensive especially for the size of the cookie they are. But they are very moist and the chocolate taste just right
67,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,9/18/2008,"SO. GOOD.

Call me a plain jane but I have a soft spot for the original chocolate chip. Sometimes if I'm feeling saucy I'll get some peanut butter chocolate chip just to mix it up a little.

They may be a tad bit pricey but  they are totally worth it. 
No matter what time you go during the day the cookies are always warm and the chocolate chips gooey. I could go without the attitude most of the staff is throwing around but even that's worth dealing with to get my hands on some of this goodness.

My one MAJOR issue is that they are located directly across from the entrance to my work. Sometimes it's just too hard to fight the craving. But on days when I visit I just skip the elevator and take on the 5 flights of stairs to burn some extra calories... that's fair, right?"
68,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,8/5/2013,This place brings bad sooo many good childhood memories! Who knew a cookie could do that! I can't wait to go back!
69,The Boston Chipyard,2 star rating,8/14/2007,"Ok, what kind of chipyard:

only has 3 types of cookies
only sells mini cookies
and only sells them in 6 or more??

$3.50 for 6 of those cookies and they weren't even good.  I had one and threw the rest away.  No bueno."
70,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,10/16/2008,"$3 for 6 cookies is a little steep, even if they are delicious.  The size of the actual cookie was maybe the size of a silver dollar.

I, can't tell you which cookie I liked best, because I inhaled them all... but they must have been good cause they didn't last long."
71,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,3/21/2010,"I have been visiting this place since I was a kid and it is still the same great cookie. Every once and a while well visiting Quincy Market, stop by this place for delicious cookies that literally melt in your mouth with great taste and flavor. The original is still the same recipe and they have peanut butter and double chocolate fudge. You can even ship these places. I highly recommend trying these scrumptious delights!"
72,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,7/13/2016,"Cookies are definitely fresh, but the cookies are mediocre at best. I tried pistachio, chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, peanut butter. I'm still definitely a  fan of the good old Mrs. Fields, even if it is a chain bakery."
73,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,2/8/2009,"...the Chipyaaahd! I'm certainly not the first, but as a New Yorker, I couldn't resist

A sneaky friend of mine stealthily made her way to the Chipyard and bought a bag of fresh cookies, chocolate chip, peanut butter, and chocolate. She also came bearing bottles of milk. 

When I took my first bite, my teeth slowly sunk and I was transported back to my childhood, to a time when the simple taste of a fresh cookie could make problems vanish and moments glow. 

Maybe the location is a very touristy area -but whatever, the cookies were good. Next time I'm in Boston I'll be sure to stop by and grab a bag of happiness. 

I am now forever grateful to a sneaky pal who slipped away to purchase some cookies."
74,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,3/17/2009,"I first saw a review for this place on that food show fantom something and immediately needed to find it.
Mmmm...I do like me some cookies.  They don't do anything real fancy and everything has chocolate chips in it, so if you're looking for ass cookies, look somewhere else.  My favorites are the chocolate chip, peanut butter chocolate chip, and fudge chocolate chip cookies.  The cookies are small but melt in your mouth.  The place isn't much bigger than a serving cart and the price may be a little high for cookies, but it's worth it for the treat.  You also get a little show along with your cookies as they tend to toss the cookies into the bag from the scooper.
If you like cookies, try this place it out.  They got a fun, memorable name (get it?  It's a pun.) and cookies are fun no matter who you are."
75,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,8/13/2012,"While in Boston, I Yelped, ""best cookies,"" and The Boston Chipyard came up so it was my mission to bring some of those cookies back home to San Francisco.

Finding their spot within Quincy Market was really tough.  They're not in the main hall, they're situated at one of the side halls within Quincy Market and hidden behind a wall.  Best point of reference is to find MIJA Cantina and TBC is a few kiosks down.

When I finally found TBC, my mouth was watering looking at all of their bite sized cookie goodness.  They had your basic flavors of chocolate chip, white chocolate but they also had a banana chocolate chip.  I bought a tin that could hold 3-4 dozen cookies which cost about $22 or so and got a variety of flavors.  They even sealed the tin with tape, which was nice; as much as I love cookies, I didn't want my clothes smelling like them.  I did however order a few pieces beyond the tin and the cookies were great.  The bite sized portions were perfect, you could get 2-3 bites just to want to grab another one to nibble on; one buttery nibble after the other.  They were quite addicting!

The tin made it home safe and sound and opened it about two days after the cookies were packed and they still tasted good!  The s/o really loved them and nibbled on them for the next few days.  You can say they were good to the very last bite!"
76,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,3/10/2012,"I just love these guys, and it's a staple visit for me any time when I'm in Faneuil Hall.
Who does not love warm cookies that are fresh out of the oven?  Warm chocolate chip is just a wonderful Americana desert that you can easily share with a group of people. 

 I will say that it's a touch pricey for what you get and something about the chocolate will not allow my body to eat too many of them (besides cookies in general are not the healthiest thing on the planet) my limit is around 3.

I highly suggest picking up a strong cup of coffee before walking over to the ""Chipyard"" and then allow yourself to indulge."
77,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,6/23/2015,Truly the best cookies I have ever had! Always baked perfect :)I have to have them when ever I'm there! Eating some now thanks to my friends who went yesterday and they are just as good as if I got them today ;)
78,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,1/11/2015,"Bostonian at heart. Grew up going to fanueil hall all the time and i have to stop here. Delicious homemade fresh cookies. My favorite is a regular choc chip and the mint chip! Try it all, you wont be disappointed. And yes, the lines are worth it!"
79,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,12/17/2014,holy wow!  These cookies are great!  Our office just got these as a holiday gift.  I'm pretty sure they were gone in 60 seconds.  Ha!
80,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,7/29/2010,Pretty good overall. Oatmeal raisin did not taste like oatmeal raisin though. Tried pretty much ever flavor. Banana choc chip was good
81,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,11/3/2014,"A trip to Boston isn't complete without a trip to the Chipyard.  The cookies are the perfect size, the right amount of chewy and crispy!  The double chocolate are my favorite and you can even buy yourself a cup of milk!"
82,The Boston Chipyard,3 star rating,4/12/2014,"Average cookies. Not sure what the hype is. If you need a great cookie, go to Potbelly."
83,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,5/19/2011,"These taste like true homemade cookies. A bit pricey ($6 for a dozen smallish cookies) but you can't beat the flavor. Out of the three flavors I tried (original choc chip, peanut butter choc chip, fudge choc chip), the peanut putter choc chip was the best. Whyyyy did I have to find this place?? Arghh it'll be so hard to avoid now!"
84,The Boston Chipyard,2 star rating,2/15/2017,"Used to be good, but not anymore. Cookies have shrunk and are barely even two bites. Not worth the money."
85,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,1/9/2010,"This place is SO BAD for me. But SO GOOD.

Worth the money. It's your classic ""melt-in-your-mouth"" freshly baked cookies. Even better than my roommate's homemade cookies (but don't tell her I said that)."
86,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,11/26/2014,"It's simply delicious choc chip cookies like you would make at home from scratch.  About a half dozen different variations on any given day.  $6 a dozen, they are small but still a good value and easy to share with a friend.  Get a batch warm from the oven, all melty & full of love!  They have wisely kept it simple."
87,The Boston Chipyard,4 star rating,2/22/2011,"$6 for a dozen cookies is a pretty good deal, and they have excellent chocolate chip and fudge chocolate chip cookies.

Not sure why they don't list their prices anywhere though. I feel like every other question from potential customers is about how much a half-dozen or a dozen cookies cost.

Why make things more difficult when people want cookies, Chipyard?"
88,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,6/26/2008,"Incredible cookies, especially when fresh out of the oven!

I was introduced to the Boston Chipyard's cookie goodness thru work, when a sales rep brought us a tin of cookies in an attempt to get us to spend money!

We ignored the rep and devoured the cookies. So good!

I've since been to the actual stand in Quincy Market, and while I do agree that this is largely a tourist trap with high prices, the quality of the cookies are just too good to pass up.

Pick up a small bag of cookies before wandering around Fanueil Hall. You'll love the cookies, and be back for more before you head home!"
89,The Boston Chipyard,5 star rating,9/8/2012,"It's hard to find quality chocolate-chip cookies these days, but these people do a great job.

0,Bricco,5 star rating,3/28/2022,"Amazing food and fun, if quite loud, atmosphere. Brought my mother for her 94th birthday and we had a wonderful time. Valet (they were very nice) was crucial. Crazy expensive ($30) but with no parking in North End it was well worth it."
1,Bricco,5 star rating,2/13/2022,"We went here for Valentine's Day and had an awesome evening. We started off with the zucchini flowers which were stuffed with truffle flavored ricotta. So good! We also had the arancini balls which were perfectly plated and had an awesome taste. The risotto was cheesy while the outside has a good crust, yum! I went with the duck for dinner and it was perfect. Confit legs were juicy and fall of the bone, the breast was cooked perfect medium to medium rare. The skin had a good crust and the sauce was a great blend of salty and sweet. 

Service was impeccable. I didn't have to touch the bottle of wine because our waiter always kept us with a full glass! Dinner was timed great and it was a relaxing atmosphere. 

This is a great spot if your looking for something a little more special than your classic chicken parm and pasta places. It is a bit pricey so as long as you know you are going for a full experience and not to just stuff your face, then you will be quite happy. 

Thank you Bricco team, we will be back!"
2,Bricco,2 star rating,2/6/2022,"Admittedly, based on the menu and pricing alone, I could sort of tell what kind of place this was going to be. Really overpriced basic Italian, not creative or done with care. 
We walked in and it was beyond noisy, luckily we were seated upstairs, although it was at an awkward little two-top next to a service station. No big deal.
Fresh bread for the table, nicely made bread but with the teensiest little 3 sauce presentation- cold white bean mush that tasted straight out of the can with no seasoning, very nice pesto, and olive oil with garlic. Someone's idea of it being ""fancy""... maybe just serve it with olive oil? Couldn't get at the sauces because of the tiny containers.
Split everything: we got a prosciutto appetizer with like 4 thinly cut pieces of meat, one single piece of toast with meh quince paste and some unidentifiable shmear of soft cheese with no flavor. I simply don't get it. It was NOT cheap.
Mussels were whatever. Again, not cheap and probably the least amount of mussels I've ever been served. More capers than mussels, literally. Nondescript broth. Again, a single piece of hard toast.
The only nicely made dish: homemade pappardelle with wild boar ragut and mushrooms. Beautifully prepared, great sauce to pasta to mushroom ratio, great texture. I was impressed, especially because the first two dishes were so disappointing.
Veal Osso Buco: veal was nicely cooked, but served with saffron ""risotto"" ... sacreligeous to call that risotto. Wow. It was like bad boxed rice, stiff and lumpy. Unseasoned steamed spinach on the side. There was also a tinny taste that was either the result of the tomatoey sauce on the veal or like cheap saffron seasoning mix from the rice. 
We opted not to get dessert because everything was so blah.
Our server was sweet, just a kid doing his best. The restaurant itself is just.... a tourist trap-type place for people who don't know good food from bad, looking for a ""fine dining"" experience. 
There are just so many amazing Italian places, these days, with beautiful special food, this place just felt like someone was forced to put an Italian menu together and given price points. Big big blah. The only extra star is for the pappardelle and decent service."
3,Bricco,2 star rating,1/27/2022,"Dinner for two tonight:

Cocktails menu was overpriced and a bit touristy customization of classics do I stuck with a draft beer.

Bread is good but the condiments being provided with it ( white bean mush, garlic olive oil and pesto) aren't great but they are also served in too small a bowl to reasonably dip the bread. More pretentious than good or functional 

The appetizers were the mussels with capers which were over cooked and too many empty shells. It seemed more capers than mussels

The prosciutto was ok but not great and the condiments were an undefined cheese and a sweet ham like paste. Eh

The pappardelle pasta with wild boar was our first good dish and we both liked it. Good pasta, nice wild boar ragouts.

The veal ossobuco with risotto was disappointing at best. The risotto was either undefined pasta or some type of sticky rice like, the spinach was flavorless and undercooked. The veal was well cooked.

We looked at the desert menu but based on our luck so far we decided to skip it.

If we will be back here it will be for pasta only."
4,Bricco,4 star rating,4/10/2022,"Overall bricco was really good with good service and nice atmosphere. Not pictured but they gave bread for the table with pesto, garlic, and a white bean dip. The Pappardelle was very rich in wine sauce but the meat was super tender and pasta was fresh. The Agnollotti was good too. The sauce was light and fresh. Overall you can get better bang for your buck in the north end, but good experience"
5,Bricco,4 star rating,3/15/2022,"We made reservations for a party of 5 on a Saturday night in March. Seated promptly. Overall vibe is great, lots and energy- wait staff bustling here and there. Once we were seated, that energy became a bit loud. It was hard to have a conversation across the table, so that is a little disappointing. Service was good, not rushed. Food was good but I have to say I didn't quite have enough. Hardly ever the case for me! I had the amatriciana pasta and it almost felt like a side dish. Other plates were larger. Also felt that the prices were too high, even for Boston and because I was still hungry.  Great menu, lots of variety and less traditional Italian dishes. Pappardelle was delicious. Not my favorite Tiramisu, I prefer if it sits a bit and is less soggy.  Bread pudding and gelato were very good. Overall I don't think you would be disappointed in your meal."
6,Bricco,5 star rating,1/7/2022,"I came here for Dinner Monday (12/27) and was surprised at how busy it was but they were able to seat us right away. This was the best meal on this trip to MA for me. The tom collins cocktail was not good though. 

All the food we got was delicious. We ordered the Octopus and the Beef Carpaccio appetizers. My aunt and I both loved the Farfalle Tartufate with lobster. 

They liked the Tiramisu but prefer a traditional one over the deconstructed version at this restaurant. 

Service was great."
7,Bricco,4 star rating,11/29/2021,"Bricco has one of my favorite menus in the North End. There are so many fantastic options, from pasta, to meat, to seafood. The portions for the pasta dishes can be a bit small, but you'd be surprised how full you get! I had the ricotta pillows and they were fantastic. They are similar to a ravioli dressed with truffle butter, wild mushrooms, and the most delicious gnudi di ricotta garnish. I also highly recommend the Rare-Seared Ahi Tuna dish. It was fantastic.
We were out with a group of 6 celebrating my boyfriends birthday, so our waitress brought out an amazing dessert sampler. I especially loved vanilla bean bread pudding with caramelized banana & vanilla gelato."
8,Bricco,5 star rating,10/28/2021,"Bricco was amazing!

I was a little unsure looking at Google and Yelp reviews because there was so much variability in what people thought.

My husband and some friends and I went on a weeknight. It was packed! In a good way, it felt very lively and like we had found a good spot. Three of us split a wonderful wine and we tried the eggplant bake for an appetizer. This was delicious, not too large or overwhelming ( a portion sufficient for two so we got two), and the eggplant was cooked well and not coated in thick cheese.

For entrees we had the pappardelle and ricotta pillows, which I think were two great options given how different the dishes were from each other. The ricotta pillows are flavorful but light, and the Pappardelle is a smidge heavier and more savory (not too overbearing meat wise). Portions were not tiny but also not overbearing family style sizes. They were actually the appropriate portions for a meal which was great for us because we had room for dessert.

We tried the chocolate cake and deconstructed tiramisu. Highly recommend the tiramisu as they put it together for you as the side of the table which was fun to watch. Must have been one of the best tiramisu we've had! It tasted so fresh and authentic. The chocolate cake was good but tiramisu was definitely the hit.

Would I come back?! 

Yes. It's hard to find reliably good pasta in a fun environment, so I definitely recommend this spot in North End if you love pasta and wine!
We really want to come back for the late night menu pizza!

The service was good but the staff was definitely busy and we got the wrong check twice. The food quality made up for that."
9,Bricco,3 star rating,9/22/2021,"Not sure what the hype was about this place.  I ordered the Ossobucco, and it wasn't as tender as it should have been, and the sides were just so, so.  The rice was not flavored well and the vegetable was not a favorite.  The hubby had rare seared ahi . Nothing special about it.

Service was not as pleasant either.  The young man that gave us our menus and water was very friendly and communicative, but our actual server was not as friendly as the first server. 

Definitely not worth spending this much money here."
10,Bricco,5 star rating,9/19/2021,"We had an epic meal tonight at Bricco in the North End. We lucked into getting a reservation on a warm night on a Sunday and were seated outside on Hanover street. Yes, the Bricco dining room is elegant and attractive but the experience of outdoor dining in the North End trumps any amount of polished wood and leather and celebrity photos. 

I had chosen Bricco based on some article about the top 5 espresso martinis in Boston with Bricco no. 1 but actually that $19 martini was just moca and amaretto with vodka and was pretty sweet and just okay. 

Luckily every single other thing we put in our mouths was mind blowing. 

The crispy Italian bread (complementary) was fresh and served with roasted garlic, pesto, and white bean spread. 

For apps, we ordered the eggplant parm, very well done, and the zucchini flowers were stuffed with truffled ricotta and deep fried, divine. 

The ricotta pillows were plump and velvety and exploding with truffle, same stuff as the zucchini flower filling). And the pasta of the day was a truffled risotto. We're big truffle fans. 

My wife ordered a glass of Feliz Creek 75 Cabernet which was so savory and well rounded that she soon whipped out her phone and ordered a case delivered to our house. In this case drinking-and-purchasing worked out well. 

The meal was a splurge ($170 with tip) but worth it."
11,Bricco,4 star rating,8/6/2021,"Wow. I'm new to the Boston area and I feel blessed that this was the first restaurant I tried. This restaurant is conveniently located close to Faneuil hall, less than a 10 minute walk. 

All the restaurants in little Italy seem amazing, but I decided to walk into the most crowded one. It definitely did not disappoint. They were even able to seat me immediately. 

This was the perfect place for a solo date. The service was fast, all my questions were answered and I was recommended their famous Farfalle Tartufate. 

The pasta was just the right amount for one person. Not too small yet not too big. I definitely cleaned my plate. The sauce was the perfect amount of sweet and acid, with a lot of truffle flavor. The pasta itself was bow tie shape but with meat inside! As I type about my meal, I'm starting to crave it again!! 

I also ordered the tiramisu and was somewhat disappointed. They tried being creative by presenting a deconstructed version and piecing the dessert in from me. The presentation was kinda cool, I most definitely prefer an original tiramisu. 

I'd definitely come back for more pasta!"
12,Bricco,4 star rating,8/27/2021,"Bricco is the long-standing, celebrity-visited establishment that does everything okay but nothing great. 

Before you jump all over my review, hear me out. I did not have a bad dish or disliked any of my food during our visit. However, the hype that surround Bricco and its storied history left me a little underwhelmed. When you hear people say it's ""THE BEST"" I don't take that lightly. So let me share my thoughts with you. 

First, the atmosphere is awesome. So much dark wood, leather, and pictures of celebrities that have dined there... it's amazing in addition to seeing the wine on display. 

The staff is super helpful, friendly, and professional - you know this place has it's $h!t together as it a run like a well-oiled machine. Getting people in and out efficiently and all the food flying out of the kitchen. It's an impressive feat, really.

The food like I said is well executed but none of it had the ""WOW"" factor I associate with ""the best"" food in Boston. I would say it is appropriate or above average for the price paid. The oysters were fresh and cold, the zucchini blossoms were crispy (not super oily), and the pasta dishes were good and flavorful with the pasta being cooked with just the right amount of ""bite"" - al dente.   

While I would return and dine there again, I will do so keeping my expectations aligned with my experience there. It's definitely an experience going to eat at Bricco, and while the food is good and I have no complaints there are better (and cheaper) restaurants in Boston's North End. You can't go wrong eating here, but I will not be touting it as the best in the North End and certainly not in the city."
13,Bricco,3 star rating,12/28/2021,"Really a 3.5. one of the most disappointing experiences here on Christmas Day. Waiter was pushy and told us not to talk to the bus boy. Told us we couldn't order pizza. this was after spending $300 and wanted one to go after 4 surrounding tables had ordered pizza for their main meals. Felt rushed, and food was under seasoned. Place was super quiet so not sure why the rush. Been a tradition for years but this may have sealed the deal for us......."
14,Bricco,5 star rating,3/20/2022,Came here for Boston Dine-out week! Salmon and meatballs were very hearty -- fresh made pasta also didn't miss.
15,Bricco,5 star rating,12/1/2021,"The food here is amazing! The flavors were incredible., the presentation was great and everything tasted truly expertly crafted. The restaurant is on the smaller side which creates a more intimate dining experience. The Service we had was good. Our server was knowledgeable and fielded our questions with patience and precision. The menu had a nice variety without trying to do too many things at once. The cocktails were spectacular and there was an extensive wine list. I highly recommend stopping by Bricco whether you're a local or visiting the city."
16,Bricco,4 star rating,5/7/2021,"My family came here once a couple years ago and remembered having a good time and decided to come back. Was pleased to find that the food was just as good as we recalled! 

We ordered the octopus as an appetizer, which was my favorite plate. All of our entrees were excellent-- absolutely wonderful food. Our waiter was also very nice and made sure we were taken care of.

The reason that I'm giving four stars rather than five is just small things that made our dinner good rather than outstanding. Our reservation was at 7, we got there about 15 minutes early, and were waiting for a half hour to be seated. We also felt a bit rushed during dinner, as our appetizer and entrees came out pretty quickly. Ironically, the dessert took the longest time to come out! Other than that, Bricco is a fantastic restaurant, and one that I would be happy to come back to for any special occasion or nice dinner."
17,Bricco,5 star rating,4/2/2022,"We had a 9:30 table because the restaurant was packed all night. When we sat down, everyone on the team was absolutely wonderful. From giving us bread, water and having Emilio be our waiter for the rest of the evening. Emilio was extremely knowledgeable, warm and friendly. You can take him and any of the team, drop them in any Michelin starred restaurant in Italy and they wouldn't miss a beat. The polenta with the sauce on top was creamy and soft, absolutely phenomenal, just needed a touch of salt. The meatballs were like nona made them. The burrata was creamy and the perfect temperature (pro tip: ask for a side of quince purée). My wife's braised beef was soft like good French butter, and my farfalle with lobster tasted like it was made by a pasta master from Emilia Romagna. The chocolate torte and espresso martini were the perfect ending. We'll be back very soon!"
18,Bricco,5 star rating,2/27/2022,"I don't know what was better, the service or the food. We had the most excellent informative and entertaining waiter. He talked about wine, life, cheese, life, pasta, life, and meat (and life). Every course was better than the one before, and the wine pairings were perfect. We rolled over to Mike's for a cannoli just before closing, and then poured our stuffed little selves into the tiniest Prius ever made to round out a perfect evening. If you haven't tried this gem, then you owe it to yourself."
19,Bricco,4 star rating,2/9/2022,This review is a 4 star review and not a 5 star review because of the appetizers. The appetizer sets the meal up and starts your palette journey. Unfortunately the muscles did not hit the mark and were extremely bland 2/5. The rest of the meal was fantastic. Ahí tuna was seared perfectly. The ricotta pillows were like heaven in your mouth with accents of truffle and mushrooms. The pappardelle al cinghiale was earthy yet sophisticated. I cannot wait for my next experience at Bricco.
20,Bricco,5 star rating,11/3/2021,"Nothing like the North End in Boston for some great throwback experiences with a still-very-today vibe. 
I got lucky enough to hit up a Boston homeboy buddy while I was in Beantown for a conference in Sept. 2021 - my first conference travel since the pandemic kicked off in March 2020 - and ask if he had calendar space for a get together while I was in town. He did, suggested we meet at Bricco. 
Service was stellar, since my buddy has been going to Bricco for decades now - he knew the gentleman who waited on us, it was great to have that extra input and attention.
Food was ZOMG, classic Italian version. Loved, loved, LOVED my squid ink pasta with lobster tail, which I washed down with a delicious glass of Gavi. 
We were there relatively early, so the place wasn't (yet) crowded, I'm sure this joint turns into a real scene at the height of dinner.
I enjoyed it so much that the next time I'm in Boston, Bricco is high on my list for another visit."
21,Bricco,4 star rating,10/26/2021,"Bricco has a great atmosphere for a date night or special occasion. Very classy interior and a nice menu. I ordered the gnocchi and while it was very good, I don't know that it was really worth $26. The bread was fluffy and the pesto and roasted garlic served with it were great. 

Our waitress was very attentive and picked out a good wine after we asked for a recommendation. Bill was almost $50pp with pasta and one glass of wine each."
22,Bricco,5 star rating,4/4/2021,"Delicious food, comfortably dark ambiance. They're known for their espresso martinis and they did not disappoint. Great spot for friends or date nights. Appetizers: octopus, meatballs were good. Pappardelle al Cinghiale (wild boar) was good but heavy.

For validated parking at the Haymarket Garage, Bricco's connected with restaurants including Quattro, Trattoria Il Panino, etc. Bring your parking pass to the hostess for a stamp. I believe you get up to 2-3 hours of parking that's discounted or free - it's been different over the last six months."
23,Bricco,3 star rating,7/19/2021,"Many North End restaurants seem to be well staffed and have new outdoor seating on the street. This is a definite improvement to the area and very similar to the Italian way of dining! The street is now one lane in each direction instead of two, so avoid driving here if you can. Parking is in private garages or on other streets.

The interior is quite dark. There is a long bar along the wall to the left of the entrance. A hostess station is about half way in to the restaurant. The menus are heavy bound, almost book like in their appearance with just the two pages plus a small insert for steak options. The drinks menu is similarly bound with many pages of beers, wines and cocktails.

Tables are covered in white cloth, with cloth napkins and nice, heavy flatware. Water glasses, and bread plate round out the setting. We were seated at a table for two inside the restaurant next to large open windows giving the feel of being on a porch.

The kitchen, located at the back of the dining area is open. You pass by on your way to be seated and wow is there a lot of heat coming out of there. They have what appears to be a brick fire oven, but I don't remember pizza being on the menu. Tables are set as two and four tops. Along the wall on your right is a full length mirror allowing diners facing the wall to see what is happening behind them. Restrooms are past the bar.

Shortly after being seated we were asked if we wanted still, sparkling or tap water. Along with water, bread was delivered with a roasted garlic oil, pesto that tastes of anise and a white bean spread which is very mild. This staff member kept an eye on all diners bringing new diners water and bread. Bottled water is left in a metal wine cooler by the table while tap water is refilled by another member of staff.

We ordered a glass of beer, a glass of wine, two appetizers and one pasta dish. The wine, Rosso di Montelcino, is from a vineyard in Tuscany, and one I keep on hand at home. The glass I received was from a bottle opened the previous night based on the taste. There are systems available to preserve wine in open bottles, and for the price of the 6oz pour I received, they should absolutely be using one. There is zero reason why any customer should get an 'old' glass of wine.

The meatball appetizer comes with three meat balls about the size of a ping pong ball, covered in tomato sauce, a large dollop of soft cheese and a grilled piece of bread  It is a tasty meatball and would be a nice starter for two or three people. The sauce is light, the cheese mild.

The burrata appetizer consists of one small asparagus, sliced lengthwise, grilled and then set, flat side down, on the platter. This is covered in a generous serving of arugula, a few slivers of roasted red pepper and two cherry tomatoes cut in half.  On top is placed an individual sized burrata, with a sprinkle of black pepper and a drizzle of balsamic on the side of the platter taking up the other half of the dish. The asparagus is cooked firm, the arugula is fresh, the roasted red peppers mild and a nice addition to the dish. The Burrata has a thin, outer mozzarella like 'shell' that when cut through reveals a creamy curd inside. The first taste was tart which leads me believe it is made with buffalo milk which is very popular in Italy just now.  A drizzle of high quality olive oil would have benefited this dish. The balsamic was in line with what is available in American grocery stores, not the smoother quality vinegar found in Italy.

In many American-Italian restaurants, you get a heaping bowl of pasta. Not here. Instead it is presented as it would be in Italy as a primo corso, consumed before your secondo corso.  The pasta was an extruded style like a spaghetti, but as thick as ziti, only solid, instead of hollow and about three times as long. Due to the density of this pasta, in order to cook through to the center, the exterior is a bit soft, while the center more al dente. Flavor of the sauce was good, with bits of pancetta throughout.

We finished with espresso and the serving size is generous. An espresso in Italy is about 2 to 3 sips. Here is was a good 6 or more. A 'Doppio' if you will. The coffee is served with sugar on the side and one cookie.

From my experiences of dining in Italy for a number of years while a resident, it is not possible to recreate the food experience in the U.S. This location comes close to replicating the dining experience and of course Italian foods shipped to the U.S. cost more (like the wine) than when consumed in the country of origin. Every dish was tasty and simple with a nice presentation. The quality was good and ingredients fresh. The wait staff are well trained and professional and the ambiance refined while still relaxed. Plenty of guests were in their shorts and tank tops and all were treated equally well. Your final bill will reflect the combination of presentation, waitstaff, and ambiance."
24,Bricco,5 star rating,3/20/2022,I went to Bricco for restaurant week.  The menu selection for restaurant week was great.  There was an appetizer entree and dessert choice for everyone's palate.  The food was excellent and our waiter Luke was very professional and knowledgeable.  We did request upstairs seating and it was perfect because there was no problem with the noise.  I would go back again!!
25,Bricco,4 star rating,8/7/2021,"Why I'll go back:  Still some of the best food in the North End
You HAVE to order:  Baked eggplant appetizer (never disappoints), Amatriciana (my wife's go-to fave), gnocchetti for the kids (mine order it every time)
Tony's Tip:  the main room on the right is loud, but it's where liveliest if you want that energy, the main room on the left is classy, but quieter, and avoid the upstairs at all costs (tight and not as elegant)

To be honest, I struggled with this rating. Why? I have always loved the food here and Bricco is pretty much always the first place that comes to mind when I think of eating out in the North End. But the restaurant has lost some elegance over time, maybe enough so that I'm not sure I'm excited to head over there again any time soon.

Exhibit #1:  Twice in the past year, we've dined there when a group nearby was way too drunk and way too loud, behaving like they were at a dive bar (and I love dive bars) instead of a fine restaurant. The first time, they got into it with the table next to us after they were asked to take it down a notch. Management eventually had to diffuse the situation. The second time (just recently), a group of 8 two tables down was cackling up a storm, with a couple of them eventually saddling up with the couple eating next to us, hanging all over them and rambling on about whatever. The decibel level literally dropped in half after they left.

Exhibit #2:  Our server could not have been less welcoming or devoid of personality on our last visit. Big guy, middle aged, seemed like he wanted to be anywhere but there. Never cracked a smile once. Mechanically took our orders. Left us hanging at least 30 minutes after our appetizers without letting us know when the entrees might be coming. Forgot the side order of carrots I ordered (but it showed up on the bill anyway!).

Exhibit #3:  Food and drinks are getting sloppy. This last visit, my wife's Aperol Spritz was mostly spritz, very little Aperol (so basically soda water and prosecco). She had to ask them to top it off, and it at least came back drinkable. Then she had what she thought was the worst serving of Amatriciana she's ever ordered there (and I'm talking dozens of times). Bland (for that sauce) with undercooked noodles.

Were they busy this last visit? Sure. Were they understaffed? Likely. Whatever - the experience sucked, and it isn't really a one-off at this point. I think we'll still keep Bricco in the rotation. But this restaurant is no longer the ""date night out"" spot that we used to enjoy, and it is motivating us to think about our other options more (Teatro, Sorellina - see you soon!)."
26,Bricco,1 star rating,1/6/2022,"My girlfriend and I went here for Christmas eve. On all fronts, this place is a flop.

Atmosphere 1/10:

It is cramped and noisy. The tables for two are an awkward size. We sat upstairs and it was not so nice. Walking through the downstairs was also uninspiring. It was hard to hear each other talking which is not a great start to a romantic date. I will give them 1 point for not having carpet on the floors.

Food Quality 2/10:

I think for the average person in Boston who did not grow up eating homemade Italian food, this place can be passable as just okay... Unfortunately, growing up in an Italian family, the food was actually just not good. The pasta was homemade, but it was actually undercooked. Not aldente... but... undercooked. The grated cheese they served at the table was not a high-quality Reggiano Parm and not freshly grated. It was very flavorless; It was missing that salt crystal crunch and umami of high-quality grating cheese. Maybe it was sitting in the fridge like that uncovered; who knows? But it was like they sucked all the flavor out of it and shipped it far
away.

Appetizer: 2/10

It was fried well. But it was just a deep Fried flower with a no flavor plain ricotta. Very just ...okay.

My Dish 1/10:
They added some weird sausage to my dish, which was very overpowering and tasted like low-end smoked chorizo. The portion size would fit in about a mug and was served on a massive plate. The red sauce was also sweet, as if they had added sugar to the sauce, with no fresh basil. Also couldn't find the garlic in this dish??

My Girlfriends dish 2/10:

The portion size was alright but lacked any authentic flavor to the meal. It was called ricotta pillows, but the ricotta was not that great and was not seasoned. It was very plain. The pasta was also not done being cooked again..not Aldente but undercooked. It was basically a lame ravioli in a sauce that tasted like flavorless oil.

The Free Bread 6/10:

The bread was good, nothing bad to say. But nothing amazing.

Prices 0/10:

I would personally be embarrassed to serve this food to my family for Sunday dinner. It was very pricy for food that was just not great to put it plainly. Even if it were cheap, I wouldn't come back. I guess if you don't have experience with good Italian food this place might be for you. It seems more like a cash grab for just existing in the north end. I can't Imagine pricing any of our dishes for over $15-20.

Summary:

I rather eat a hot dog than eat at Bricco again."
27,Bricco,5 star rating,8/2/2021,"Bricco does not disappoint. Highly recommend stopping by this North end restaurant for lunch, the portions are a bit small but the food is delectable and perfect if you'll be walking around the area. They are known for espresso martinis so definitely order one if you enjoy them. For mains we ordered the Porcini Ravioli and Pumpkin Tortellini, both dishes were so fresh and perfectly cooked. The procini mushrooms and sauce were perfectly paired and the tortellinis and a sweet flavorful touch. Overall wonderful experience and will definitely stop by next time I am back"
28,Bricco,3 star rating,11/16/2021,"Good, but overpriced, noisy, small/cramped space, and slow service. This is definitely the type of place that just crams tables as close as they can together without giving any care to their diners' comfort -- We were seated at a table with people so close to us that when they were seated/leaving their table, their butts would nearly spill my glass over. My husband sat with his back to an aisle was routinely bumped into. This really didn't set a good tone for the meal as we were worried about people spilling out drinks the entire time and could barely hear each other over the music. It was also very dimly lit that we needed to use the flashlight app on our phone to read the menu. The people next to us did the same thing.

My husband got the surf and turf -- Found having to clean the lobster himself kind of annoying especially since he paid so much for it. 

I got some sort of homemade pasta but that was pretty good but not quite what I expected based off of the menu. 

I had to leave after our meal to catch a flight so we ordered our bread pudding to go -- It was okay. Nothing to write home about. 

Overall, I left feeling pretty bummed like we overpaid for average Italian food and a cramped, noisy atmosphere. Will not be returning."
29,Bricco,5 star rating,5/27/2021,"The only reason I have not written a review is just pure negligence on my part because I've been here enough times to speak on it.

Some of my friends feel Bricco is a bit overpriced but I argue that the quality of what you get is completely worth the price, and it's really not outlandish for the North End.  

Bricco gets buzz because of their Ricotta Pillows, and don't get me wrong, they are divine.    But my favorite dish (and I seriously daydream about it) is the Pappardelle al Cinghiale.  First of all, I am a fan of the shape and consistency of pappardelle pasta.  But the wild boar and that sauce brings it to a whole new level.   Highly recommend.    However, some other top notch dishes are the Agnollotti al Plin, the Caprese, the Meatballs, and their Burrata.

Of course it's very nice and clean in this upscale restaurant, and the service is always prompt and friendly.

Bricco is usually where I bring visitors when they want to experience the North End and I'm never disappointed."
30,Bricco,3 star rating,12/14/2021,Our service was just alright. Almost rude. The food was tasty but that part was off putting. Maybe check out another spot first. And don't get their after dinner coffee drink.

Flavorful filet mignon meatballs to start, followed uo with perfectly cooked brick oven chicken and Braised Beef Short Ribs. For dessert was a creamy rich chocolate mousse and some of the best espresso martinis we've ever tasted! #1 espresso martinis in Boston. Our waitress, Patty, was both sweet and attentive, making it feel welcoming and homey. 10/10 would recommend this iconic spot in the North End that surpasses its reputation!"
33,Bricco,5 star rating,1/14/2022,"First of all, while all the restaurants stop serving food at 10, even close their kitchens before 10, Bricco knows what's up and serves food till 11.

Place was packed but we got 2 seats at the bar. Jordan our bartender, was very personable and made some great food recommendations. We ordered the Buratta, Lobster Mashed, Farfalle and the Scrimp Scampi App. These shrimp were huge! Served w a potato au gratin cake that was absolutely phenomenal. The burrata was very fresh light and delicious. Lobster Mashed were buttery with a nice smooth consistency and possibly some seasoned bread crumbs thrown in there. Farfalle are not my favorite but these were huge hand made sheets of pasta with a light spiced sauce w Fava beans and lobster. 

You won't be disappointed"
34,Bricco,5 star rating,3/12/2022,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing experience with server Patty. Her knowledge of the menu was impecable. We started with shrimp scampi and zucchini flowers which absolutely melted our tasted buds.

Please come visit and request my girl patty!!!"
35,Bricco,5 star rating,5/12/2021,"What a great experience at Bricco! After a long week my boyfriend and I decided we deserved a nice meal. We made a reservation at Bricco for 5:30. We were among some of the first tables there and got sat in the cozy upstairs. Our waiter, Emilio, was so charming! I got the ruby red cocktail and it was one of the best specialty drinks I've ever had. It was the perfect mix of sweet and sour. My boyfriend got the Chianti. We started with the meatballs which could be the best we've ever had. The ricotta on top really put it over the edge. I got the ricotta pillows.... wow. My mouth is watering thinking about them again. They were soaked in truffle oil and sautéed mushrooms. My boyfriend got the wild boar which transported us back to when we lived in Italy. The portions are a lot smaller than some of the north end restaurants but the quality of the food was out of this world."
36,Bricco,3 star rating,4/9/2022,good but not worth the price in my opinion. the starter bread wasn't good and i always look forward to the bread at italian restaurants so that was a bit disappointing. i got the ricotta pillows which had really good filling and flavor but the actual pasta part could have been better; it just tasted like it was from the store
37,Bricco,1 star rating,10/22/2021,"Overall I was truly disappointed from my experience in this restaurant.
Customer experience is awful.

After searching and reading reviews on North End restaurants, I decided to take good friends that came exploring Boston for first time.
Bricco was chosen and we all had high expectations but unfortunately we were very (VERY) disappointed.
It took a long long time for the food to be served, yes the restaurant was super busy but waiting for entrees to come for almost an hour, is unacceptable.
We tried to ask for the status and didn't get  the attention .
While eating his fish , my friend tasted something weird and found a hair (long one) inside.
As you can imagine, we were done with eating.
We called the waiter and he was in shock too BUT no one came to talk with us and give us the chance to share our bad experience. 
Not the food but the human interaction was very disappointing. 

Manager was notified but didn't come 

Issues like this can be happen,we are all human and make mistakes, but we need to admit and learn.. in this case it didn't happen 

We paid and left 

I understand the restaurant is busy and very successful but for me it is the last time I will go visit there ."
38,Bricco,1 star rating,1/27/2022,I came here with a party of 4 and was seated right away with no reservation. It was my first time there and didn't take a look at the menu before hand so I just decided to go with something simple I think it was a pumpkin pasta  dish. It was pretty plain and nothing special. I feel like the pasta was undercooked cause it was kinda of hard when I ate it but didn't care to say anything in the moment cause I was so hungry. As for the rest of the table I believe they got a steak which they said was good but since I don't eat beef I wouldn't know. There wasn't anything special about here.. I don't think I would come again not worth the money.
39,Bricco,3 star rating,10/19/2021,"We came here for a special occasion and were so excited to eat here and while the food was fine, we were rushed through our dinner in about 30 minutes and didn't even have time to order another drink. It was fine but if you are looking for a great Italian meal and experience, I would look somewhere else."
40,Bricco,4 star rating,10/27/2021,"We went for a birthday celebration and it did not disappoint. The service was top notch with a great wine receommendation and the food was great. We ordered Meatballs and Zuchini Flowers for the appetizer, and it was very tasty as well as light. Often time, you can get meatballs, which will be heavy but this openend up the palette for more. We ordered Veal Osso Bucco, Tortelli Pumpkin and Farfalle Tartufate. The Tortellini was perfect. However, the Osso Bucco needed more seasoning but the accompanied saffron risotto was just delicious. The Farfalle was fresh but did not have a lot of lobster meat. To finish things off, we ordered the Bread Pudding and the famous Espresso Martini, both of them really good.

Overall, it is a good place for a date or a celebration. The service is 5/5. The food is 4/5 and is on the expensive side."
41,Bricco,5 star rating,3/22/2022,"This place was amazing. Right in the middle of all the action. Pat took great care of me. The atmosphere is great, the food is great, my stay was great. My suite was awesome. When I come back I'll be staying here again."
42,Bricco,5 star rating,9/9/2020,"Thank you Yelp for helping me find this bakery just steps away from Modern Pastry. You have to go down the steps to get to the bakery. We were greeted by the most wonderful scent of bread. 

We picked up a loaf with prosciutto and cheese and it was absolutely delicious. The outside was hard and crunchy and the inside was fluffy and flavorful. It was $10 for a loaf but it was well worth it. I will be back to Bricco's for sure.

Note: I accidentally put my review for the Panetteria here but couldn't figure out how to delete this review. So this review is for the Panetteria, not the restaurant. :)"

44,Bricco,5 star rating,8/4/2021,"Excellent North End Italian eatery with perfectly cooked pastas and nice atmosphere. I absolutely loved the famed Espresso Martini although it comes a sharp price (~$20) -- very creamy and chocolatey, not too heavy on the coffee flavor. Each of the pastas are delicious and a good portion size, on the lighter side if anything. I had the pasta with pumpkin and it was on the sweeter side which I loved. I recommend sitting outside in the summertime and you'll have a gorgeous view of Hanover Street, the heart of the village. I will definitely be returning with more friends. Many thanks!"
45,Bricco,4 star rating,11/21/2021,"Had a fabulous meal starting with olives, bread and red wine. The server recommended a lighter red to pair with my pasta and meat. Great balance of cherry flavors to the rich brown gravy, boar and mushroom pasta. The environment was busy, a bit louder then I'd like but good to see they are back to a full experience for all to enjoy."
46,Bricco,4 star rating,6/3/2021,"This is a wonderful Italian restaurant with a upscale vibe. This is the type of place that you would come if you wanted to have a really nice night out on the town or a fancy afternoon lunch. The restaurant overall is small and somewhat cramped - I had someone bump up against my chair more than once while walking past our table. Other than that, the bar area was beautiful, the food was tasty (although the portions were a tad small for what you pay), and the service was top notch.  Note to anyone who loves tiramisu - the type they serve here is not what you expect when you order tiramisu. They bring a plate of hard, crunchy lady fingers and pour espresso over it then spread marscapone topping and then top it with fresh shaved chocolate shavings all while you watch.  It's a really nice production but the taste & texture was very different from what I'm typically used to. Overall this was a very nice dining experience.  Would love to try other things on their menu the next time I'm in the North End of Boston."
47,Bricco,5 star rating,1/8/2022,Fabulous homemade pastas delicious cocktails everything homemade and awesome!! Pricey and small menu but worth it.
48,Bricco,5 star rating,9/5/2021,"Sunday lunch was great! We're obviously visiting town, found this place had good review and make reservation ahead. Service was decent for a fast paced city like Boston ;) This restaurants gets busier as we sat down. There're out door seating as well. Food we ordered was fantastic. The short rib, let me tell ya, was the best!!!!"
49,Bricco,3 star rating,6/25/2021,"The last meal of a great trip and it was underwhelming. They sat us on the second floor, which could have been nice except the spot we were in was so dark that it was hard to read the menu. The large windows were also open, which made the area quite chilly (it was in the 60s outside). It was also rather loud, so much so that it was sometimes hard to hear each other across the table. The service was ok, but not outstanding. The food was good, though, which is why I gave Bricco 3 stars and not a lower rating."
50,Bricco,4 star rating,8/27/2021,"Love this spot! Definitely one of my favorites in the North End, and the staff is always super friendly. I think the portions/prices are alright for most of their pasta dishes, but the most bang for your buck is definitely the gnocchi and it's super delicious!"
51,Bricco,5 star rating,10/2/2021,"Fantastic pizza!  If you're here on Fridays or Saturdays try the off-menu AMAZING pizza that Bricco offers. Good for two people, it has an amazing crust, great flavors!  Marguerita or Prosciutto.

If you ask for Patrick (the ""Irishman"") great things will happen..."
52,Bricco,4 star rating,12/9/2021,"This is our first time in Boston and our hotel recommended this place and made a reservation for us.. If you're looking for anything simple like a carbonara, or bolognese you will not find it here. Also, be prepared to basically have your elbows touching the strangers next to you, and your butt to be on their table touching their food and water as you get in and out. That's how close the tables are to each other. 
Food was good, but the service was not. But the gentleman who brought us our water and bread was so kind! I will say everyone was great minus our waiter. She was an older lady with short white hair. She seemed to become quickly annoyed when we asked any questions about the menu and especially annoyed when my husband said he doesn't eat pork. I'm sorry that we had questions and had a hard time finding something we liked. I'm sure she thought we were extremely uncultured, little did she know we are huge fans of Italy and travel there multiple times a year. I only say this because the way she spoke to us, you'd think she is really making a point to make us feel like we had no idea what we were talking about. Anyway, I'll end with this, she was extremely kind and attentive to both tables right next to us, but she was the opposite with us. It was very strange and quite uncomfortable. Hopefully when you go, you don't get our waiter and you have a better experience than us! But overall, not worth the hype. I want to give less stars, but I feel bad."
53,Bricco,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"We started with meatballs as an appetizer, the ricotta cheese was creamy and the meatballs were well seasoned. The short ribs were very tender, juicy and the polenta was the perfect combination. The brick chicken was cooked to perfection with a herbal infused seasoning, the mashed potatoes were very creamy and the portion was very generous. The bread pudding was just ok. We also ordered the Tiramisu which was prepared at the table by our server...the preparation consisted on a nice amount of espresso poured over Italian lady fingers followed by a nice amount of sweetened whipped cream and finished with fresh dark chocolate shaved at the table. The restaurant was packed but the service was very prompt and attentive.  The food came right out and the ambiance was on point. We definitely will recommend it to anyone to visit and definitely will be returning to try more delicious dishes"
54,Bricco,5 star rating,6/16/2021,"My husband and I love dining here at Bricco. Their bread is fabulous and the service is stellar. My husband got the Chliean Sea Bass - which he really loves! I tried the Kurobuto Pork Tenderloin which has fresh peach & granny smith apples, crème di porcini, & wild mushroom demi glaze. Dining outside on Hanover Street is quite the experience - do it before it goes away!"
55,Bricco,3 star rating,7/24/2021,"I have been to Bricco many times and love the food. Had dinner there last night and was a little disappointed. The food was good, but the service was not too good. We had a late reservation and were seated upstairs. The tables are so crammed together, you can barely squeeze in to sit down. It seems the staff is overwhelmed, like many other businesses. We had to ask for grated cheese, flag down the waiter for dessert silverware, and no offers for 2nd cocktail. The couple next to us ordered the same dish and only one arrived. They had to wait for the 2nd.
My husband said his gnocchi was a little cold.

I hope they improve, I have had great experiences in the past. I understand the issues with staff, but you need to start with less tables. I could barely have a conversation with my  husband, and had to hand the waiter my dishes because it was so tight."
56,Bricco,5 star rating,2/21/2022,Espresso martini and eggplant were good! Great ambiance on a Thursday night at the bar.
57,Bricco,4 star rating,9/15/2021,"We thoroughly enjoyed this place.  Great bar vibe, with great drinks and staff.  Had Courtney who took great care of us two nights in a row.  We had the meatball and eggplant app.  Both were awesome.  We had brick chicken and a stuffed pasta with meat topped with spinach and truffle cream sce.  Seriously delicious."
58,Bricco,5 star rating,2/10/2020,"Ah, the North End. Personally, I don't think you can go wrong with Italian food in this hood, but with Bricco, you can go very, very right.

I love the ambiance, very rustic and cozy, with dim lighting so that you feel like you have the place to yourself once you're seated. We were lucky enough to get a table upstairs, which added to the ambiance by keeping us away from front door foot traffic.

The food was absolutely incredible. Sorry for the low-quality photos, but I guess dim lighting has its disadvantages too. If you can see it, my friend and I started with an octopus appetizer. Lightly seasoned, charred to perfection...I still think about this dish, even a few weeks later.

I had a Bolognese dish, which was also amazing. My friend enjoyed her pumpkin ravioli, but we agreed that a meat dish is probably the way to go when you're springing for a nice Italian meal.

I had heard that portions here are smaller, and it's definitely not family-style plating. But even with these portions, my friend and I couldn't get through the entire meal. Plus you need to leave room for dessert -- go get a cannoli from any of the famous bakeries nearby!

All in all, Bricco provided a really nice night out in the North End. Like all the restaurants in this area, it ain't cheap! But if you're looking to splurge on a nice night out, Bricco's got my vote for sure."
59,Bricco,5 star rating,11/8/2021,Crembrule perfect. Espresso martinis yum. Loud music and dim lights great ambiance. Servers terrific. Spaghetti is clearly homemade it's amazing.
60,Bricco,4 star rating,9/24/2021,"Expect to spend money here, that's for sure! The espresso martini was in fact delicious, but also $19. With that being said, I ordered more than one....

The zucchini flowers were very delicious and are not a menu item that you can find at every Italian restaurant, so I think this is a dish everyone should consider trying. I enjoyed the Pappardelle and my boyfriend had the Chittarine. We found that both of our servings were the perfect size, such that we didn't leave feeling uncomfortably full, yet still very satisfied. I think the espresso martini was the star of the show though!"
61,Bricco,2 star rating,12/26/2021,"If you know good Italian food, please don't eat here. The  grilled branzino was so-so, but the pasta and caprese  salad was an embarrassment. The salad was made just big hunks (not sliced) of tough grocery store tomatoes with the driest, most tasteless mozzarella I have ever tasted. The agnolotti was under cooked and chewy with hard edges. Not to mention that during a Covid resurgence, they had us wedged between two large tables. It was packed tighter than sardines in a can. Not a good experience at all."
62,Bricco,2 star rating,12/5/2021,We had dinner there were 6 of us the place is beautiful atmosphere is amazing but the food of all six dishes all 6 dishes didn't hace any flavor at all very disappointed we came on Friday night
63,Bricco,3 star rating,3/25/2021,"Came here with my partner for the dine out Boston special and we are incredibly glad we didn't pay full price  the place was quite busy for a wednesday, we weren't seated until 15 minutes after our reservation (8:15pm) and waited another 20 minutes before our order was taken. We ordered the Brodetto and lobster mash with braised short ribs, 8oz prime filet and pork tenderloin, ending with the blueberry cheesecake and tiramisu. The lobster mash was pretty good but the brodetto tasted like clams steams in straight water- there was no flavor whatsoever including even a seafood taste which was incredibly odd. We asked for bread to try the broth with and had a waiter try to take the untouched dish away twice and finally getting some on the third request which ended up being a let down anyhow. The filet was cooked very well but the pork was so dry we couldn't imagine what would happen if they didn't serve it with a whole dish of sauce. Both of the desserts came out and were fine but nothing to write home about. Like I said, I'm incredibly glad we didn't pay full price and maybe just caught them on a bad day considering how busy they were but I unfortunately can't say I'd recommend it. :("
64,Bricco,5 star rating,3/8/2021,"The Best in Boston...........Bricco is by far the best restaurant in Boston. It service is beyond wonderful, and the cuisine is very Italian based. I can not say enough about Bricco. The location is great for the city. Service was exceptional-it was very professional but also very personable. We enjoyed our interaction with Vuvu- who, at the end of the evening, invited our family on a tour of the Panneteria and the Pasta shopp. We love everything."
65,Bricco,5 star rating,8/2/2021,"Best Italian food I've had in years! We started with a Caesar salad & burrata - both delicious. 

My friends got gnocchi which was good, but my agnolotti was absolutely delicious. Everyone was stealing bites from me. Great service and atmosphere. 

I'll definitely be back!"
66,Bricco,4 star rating,12/2/2020,"Everything here looked so delicious... the actual title was Depasquale Ventures but they service to Mare, Bricco, Quattro, Trattoria II Panino... etc 
Anyhow, everything was amazing including the service. Only downside was the incredibly slow ""heater"" when you order a slice of pizza. Wish I could give 4 & 1/2 's!"
67,Bricco,1 star rating,11/27/2021,"I typically enjoy Bricco however, the other night I had a very unfortunate interaction.

I went into Bricco to have a night cap with my brother. The host would not let myself or my brother in despite our IDs with the same address. I asked if it was because of our friend with a PA license and I was told no. 

Typically BRICCO is a great spot to have an awesome night but based on my last interaction I think there are other places I would rather spend my money."

69,Bricco,5 star rating,3/29/2021,"Incredible restaurant, food, ambience. One of if not my favorite restaurants in the city. Patty is my favorite server and I sometimes go just to see her. She is welcoming, warming, great server who loves her job, the food they serve and making sure you are having a good time and enjoying your food. The food is incredibly made and delicious. The tagliatelle noodles are perfectly made. Soft but not over cooked, not watery, and just melt in your mouth. Sauce is incredible as well. Love this place and recommend it to everyone."
70,Bricco,4 star rating,9/29/2019,"Visited on a Saturday evening while in town for a convention with a group of colleagues (8). We were seated upstairs and the entire place was packed! Always a good sign! 
Service was great! All of the food was delicious and fresh, from the apps to the entrees. I had the Big Night Tampano as I'd never heard of anything like it. The best way to describe is rigatoni and meat sauce wrapped in a pasta like outer shell. It was unique and delicious. My only complaint was that the pasta inside was a bit over cooked. 
My colleague had the Pumpkin Tortelli which was also quite good. Another standout was the Zuchinni Flower appetizer.
Overall, a nice spot with very solid food in a really cool neighborhood!"
71,Bricco,5 star rating,1/23/2021,"We had our dinner here and I must say it was lovely, delicious! The ambiance is amazing, we were seated in a room very private for 2 families. The food is beyond exceptional!! I was a little hesitant with pasta restaurants especially for a fine dine $$. Last I wanna do is spend money on a pasta sauce came from a can type of experience. But my my my everything that was served here was freshly made as we were told, flavor is fantastic from the appetizer to dessert I enjoyed every single flavor! Bellesima!!! We will definitely recommend and definitely gonna come back!"

Great experience overall."
73,Bricco,1 star rating,7/7/2021,"Terrible service. Rude as hell. 
Seated us under a air vent which felt like the North Pole. Was with my 2 small  kids who were frozen. They basically told us to piss off since they refused to move us. So we left.. stay away!"
74,Bricco,5 star rating,7/31/2020,"Fantastic atmosphere, unbelievable Italian food -- the ultimate North End experience! I was so pleased with my visit to Bricco, it rivals Carmelina's with the top spot in my heart for some of the best pasta in the city. 

The staff was super accommodating and gave great recommendations. I'd been so excited to try this place, we really went all out with our order. To start off our night, we ordered a bottle of wine - definitely check out their amazing drink menu.

And now for the best part - all the delicious food! For appetizers, we ordered the insalata mista, the wellfleet mussels and the shrimp scampi. Each dish was a delight and I'd order any of the three again. I'm a sucker for seafood, and the mussels and shrimp really hit the spot. For my main meal, I split the Ricotta Pillows and the Braised Beef Short Ribs. Honestly, no writing on my part could do either plate justice. They were both some of the best culinary experiences I've ever tasted. The short rib sat on a bed of creamy, cheesy polenta and melted in your mouth. And the ricotta pillows are dressed in truffle butter which makes for the perfect combination. Needless to say, there weren't any leftovers! Can't wait to return and try more of their delectable entrees!"
75,Bricco,5 star rating,6/18/2021,Fantastic waitstaff and service at Bricco. I came in with my girlfriends for a late dinner. I had the spaghetti bolognese and my friends had the pumpkin tortellini and risotto. I have a bunch of food allergies and they were able to accommodate me really well. I highly recommend this restaurant and I look forward to returning soon.
76,Bricco,5 star rating,10/22/2021,Artemis was the best!! Made us feel so good and happy! Excellent service and great food! We will be back and requesting him!
77,Bricco,5 star rating,10/22/2021,"We stopped here on a whim when we were walking around the city. The restaurant had a great vibe and really good food. The mussels were very tasty and they definitely a great choice for an appetizer. They were also a good value for what you are paying for since there was a ton of them. 

All the food came out fast and everything tasted great. Really good service as well. I would definitely recommend for a nice date night."
78,Bricco,1 star rating,5/31/2021,"Unfortunately we didn't have a pleasant first-time experience at this place like some others. We decided to give it a try during a recent trip to Boston based on the hotel staff's recommendation. We always trust the locals' preferences so we were excited about it. We made a reservation and were seated promptly on a busy evening. We immediately noticed that this place has a dark and cozy ambiance that seems good for date nights. The tables were all jammed so close to each other though, that it felt like I could easily knock someone's wine glasses off the table when walking by. Guess nobody is COVID-conscious anymore.

The woman greeting us at the door seemed incredibly disengaged and dismissive like she's made out of an ice cube. Whoever that was so great that the other reviews have mentioned, we couldn't imagine it was her. It was definitely not a warm attitude to welcome customers and was an immediate turnoff. She seated us upstairs at a small table that's jammed in between two others. Again, we were not comfortable but didn't want to make a fuss. Within about 15 minutes another couple came and got seated next to us. The tables were so close we felt like we could almost shake hands with them without even reaching out our arms. As we continued to sit in discomfort, a waitress came to warmly greet the other couple first and asked if they'd like to order any drinks. That was the time we decided that we'd had enough. As we got up to leave the waitress seemed to have finally noticed us that she asked if we'd like to order anything too, but we just said that we are leaving, and she gave out an insincere, ""aww I'm sorry"" and just left. The other couple just looked at us in shock as we walked out. We brought our business somewhere else that night and it was well worth it.

Overall we did not feel welcomed there despite the anticipation of great food and experience. I felt like the restaurant and the area were discriminating against tourists or out-of-towners, which is a mistake unless businesses from repeated customers are enough. For the fine dining experience that this place seems to be aiming for, we were glad that we didn't spend a dime there while being treated like peasants. Safe to say that we certainly wouldn't be recommending this place to our family and friends in DC if they ever visit Boston."
79,Bricco,5 star rating,1/17/2021,"My husband and I recently had dinner at Bricco. a restaurant we discovered on a previous trip and which quickly became our favorite place to dine in the city. As always, the food was amazing, and the service excellent. But what made the evening overall was the staff, in particular, our server Joel. 

Pleasant and polite, Joel was knowledgeable about the menu, answered our questions and was attentive but not ""helicoptering"" through the evening (as we had experienced the next evening in another spot). He and the others, including the manager, Paige, made us feel comfortable and welcome. The food is always wonderful, but it's the whole package, including the people and the ambience, which makes a dining experience memorable.

There is nothing better than enjoying a meal and being treated like family by someone we just met. We have already recommended it to our family and friends and just want others to know what a great place Bricco is, not only for the food but also because of the people who work so hard to make one feel special yet do it so seamlessly. Thank you Bricco and all of your wonderful staff, can't wait to see you all again."

81,Bricco,5 star rating,4/11/2021,"i'm so glad we ran into this spot during our walk of getting to know the city. the ambiance was intimate and all the staff we were greeted with were friendly. Our waiter Emilio was one of my personal favorite people we have met on our trip. He made our experience extra special by surprising my mom with a birthday dessert. he was also very attentive, recommended the best food we've had on our trip and was just an overall sweetheart. The food???? i don't think i have enough adjectives to describe the attention to detail in every course we had: phenomenal, exquisite,  delicious, one of a kind do not suffice. i cannot recommend this location enough"
82,Bricco,3 star rating,7/22/2021,"Visited Bricco on several recommendations.  We went early and got an outdoor table very quickly.  Service was excellent, educated on the menu, and professional.  Unfortunately when our food came three (3) of the orders were completely wrong.  A fourth order, which shouldn't have had seafood in it had a strong ocean taste and multiple pieces of fish or lobster were found in the dish.  Some of the  food also arrived luke warm.  Overall we had a nice time despite the mix-ups but I wouldn't put Bricco on our top 10 list of Italian restaurants"
83,Bricco,5 star rating,5/11/2021,"This place was EXCELLENT! I was with a party of 6 and the server recommended we get a variety of appetizers which would allow us to try everything. From the meatballs, to the zucchini flowers, the burrata, to the eggplant.... delicious. After seeing both gnocchi and the pumpkin tortellini, I knew it was going to be so difficult to make up my mind. Again, the server recommended half portions of both--which I gladly did! Wow. They were so authentic, fresh, and excellent. To finish, we were given 2 complimentary desserts for celebrating a graduation, the bread pudding and a chocolate molten lava cake, which were both wonderful as well. Definitely a must go-to!"
84,Bricco,4 star rating,12/28/2020,"Bricco is located in the heart of the North End. It is actually a very very nice restaurant. Much larger than other north end spots. The doors have photos of celebrities dining at this restaurant. So it must be good! The tables were spaced out enough where you felt comfortable having a nice meal.

When you're seated and looking at the menu, you'll notice that this is a very upscale Italian seafood and steakhouse. There's a wide variety of starters to choose from, all roughly close to $20 dollars. We decided to go with the burrata. Very good and creamy. But the bread they provided was the hardest bread I've ever had. Could easily break some teeth. Should've saved the free starter bread, but we devoured that before the burrata arrived. For our entrees, we got the ricotta pillows and the briccos brodetto. The ricotta pillows were very good. But they only gave 8-10 pieces. My fiancee also thought they were a bit salty. The Brodetto was great! But I wish they served it over a bed of rice, but instead they opted for the same single slice of  burnt bread as we got with the burrata. I honestly dont think the entrees we got would be ordered again. However the service was great and the ambiance was wonderful. Great spot for a date night."
85,Bricco,5 star rating,8/19/2021,This place was so good! Went here for my parent's anniversary dinner while in town for a night and it did not disappoint.

88,Bricco,3 star rating,10/3/2021,"Saturday evening and the only reservation we could get for two was at 9.30 PM, so we took it. They seated us upstairs and after taking a while to get to us, we ordered a bottle of wine, appetizers and secondi, about $200 all in. We were enjoying the evening and our waiters seemed very pleasant until a little before 11 PM, when their demeanor changed just as we were finishing our secondi. At this time, they were rudely flourishing tablecloths right next to us as they set places at the adjacent empty tables, disturbing our meal. Then they twice tried to take our plates before we'd entirely finished eating. We brushed them off and afterwards, we were asked by our waiter, noticeably unenthusiastically, if we'd like anything else? He didn't mention dessert or a dessert menu so I asked if they had a dessert menu and the response I got was a mumbled 'gelato' and 'sorbet'. Note that the menu on the website revels that they have much more extensive dessert menu than what we were offered.

At this point it was clear that they had no interest in serving us further and so we decided that we didn't want to pay them another dollar of our hard earned income. We elected to settle the check and finish our remaining 1/4 bottle of wine. As we were doing so, I asked the waiter what time they close and he told us 11 PM (website says 2 AM but apparently upstairs closes at 11 PM).

They had several options.  If they wanted us to vacate the table by a certain time, they should have told us when they seated us. They could have let us finish our meal in the manner in which it started, which would probably have delayed them by only 10 or 15 minutes. Or they could have offered us a table downstairs for dessert. Unfortunately they did none of these things."
89,Bricco,5 star rating,2/22/2021,This place is super cute. We dined at a table but the bar seemed really nice. It's not the biggest restaurant but it's cozy and good for a date night. The waiter was really friendly. Dinner was great and dessert was yummy!
0,North Street Grille,5 star rating,1/14/2022,"This restaurant is in the heart of Little Italy in Boston. This place did not disappoint. They have a very extensive menu with a lot of fun choices. I was in the mood for basic scrambled eggs, sour dough toast, potato wedges and bacon. It was anything but basic. The eggs were extremely fluffy. The potatoes were cooked perfectly. I also ordered one chocolate chip pancake. They do not skimp on the amount nor the quality of food. I definitely took a doggy bag home. 
We received complimentary pieces of banana bread as an appetizer. This was delicious! 
I can't wait to go back and try some of their other offerings. The salty and sweet sandwich looked to die for. It is made with their banana bread. That is my next selection for the next time that we get to Boston!!"
1,North Street Grille,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"I can see why this is one of the best spots in Boston for brunch. When we arrived we put our names on the waitlist for 2 (around 11am on a Sunday) and was told about a 45 minutes wait. They took our number and would text us when the table was ready. There's a 10 minute grace period once they notify you and we had the option to opt into bar seating if that came first. We walked around and explored the area during our wait but ended up seated at our table just 25-30 minutes later. Inside it's very small and close quarters but they have plexiglass between each table. The only annoying thing was our table was in the middle and had a space big enough for people to walk through constantly while we were eating which almost defeated the purpose of the plexiglass barriers. 

We were promptly waited on and the service throughout was great. My boyfriend ordered the steak bomb omelet and I had the banana bourbon French toast. The portions were huge! I had a bite of the omelet and the veggies within were cooked perfectly and there was plenty of steak. The home fries were perfectly crispy and well seasoned. The white toast was average. The French toast portions were huge! The flavoring was on point and the French toast was cooked to perfection. I ordered a side of sausage patties for some protein and they were very tasty as well. 

This place is definitely worth the wait. The price of our meals were very reasonable, but the final bill could be pricy if you ordered a lot of alcoholic drinks or things besides water or coffee. I would 1000% come again when I'm back in the area."
2,North Street Grille,5 star rating,11/1/2021,"Oh this place is DEFINITELY worth the lines and the wait!!  With it being open only Thursday-Sunday, we knew we had to try it once we were in Boston for vacation last week.  All the Yelpsters said it was the number one place for brunch in Boston.  Believe them, people!

We made a reservation about 10 days prior, and when we arrived the line was down the block.  We were seated with a reservation within 5 min (make a reservation, people!). They are doing a great job with covid safety procedures, putting protective glass between each table.  Very cool.

Now, what did we order?  The best food!  We had the mashed potato omelet -filled with mashed potatoes, obviously, and bacon and cheese!  So damn good.  It came with a side so we got cinnamon roll French today.  To die for!  We also had the breakfast tacos, which were STUFFED!  So delicious!"
3,North Street Grille,5 star rating,4/6/2022,Amazing breakfasts and great service. Worth the wait.  They have a nice system of sending a text when it's your turn so you can wander the neighborhood.
4,North Street Grille,5 star rating,4/1/2022,"This restaurant has possibly perfected brunch. The banana bread french toast is unreal, so delicious. The chicken and waffles, chef's kiss. Corned beef hash, crushing it. And the boozy milkshakes!!! Bless their hearts."
5,North Street Grille,5 star rating,10/20/2021,"All of us were looking forward to breakfast and my bf found this spot. We looked over the reviews and the food and we were an Uber within 3 minutes
There was a wait, but WELL WORTH IT! We walked around until we were called for our table. The inside was small, but you could tell this place has been here for a while and a lot of people were regulars. 

The food was incredible! They give out banana bread for the table and WOW! I couldn't stop eating it. I'm not a big banana fan, but I could've eaten this bread all day!

I ordered the Chunky monkey and was I pleased with my order. 
Next time  ordering something savory."
6,North Street Grille,5 star rating,4/1/2022,Would definitely go back here again! They gave us some free and super yummy banana bread. Our server was courteous and food came out fast. There was a wait which flew by quickly.
7,North Street Grille,5 star rating,3/11/2022,Make reservations before you come here!! I had the Benedict in Bed and it was a tasty combination. The ham and French toast under the poached egg with Hollandaise sauce was fantastic. My girlfriend had the breakfast nachos and loved them too.
8,North Street Grille,5 star rating,3/27/2022,The shop is small but boy does it pack a punch! The breakfast was terrific! My omelette was divine! Even some simple eggs and bacon looked like a masterpiece!
9,North Street Grille,5 star rating,3/30/2021,"First time my party of 4 coming to this restaurant. We showed up for brunch on a very busy Sunday morning but they managed to squeeze us in waiting only 30 min as opposed to 2+ hours elsewhere. 

Establishment is small but they try their best with makeshift barriers. Service was incredibly friendly and attentive, what more could we ask for?

For drinks we got the iced coffee, summer dreams and pineapple mimosas. Preferably we found summer dreams to be the best drink and wasn't crazy about the mimosa. The free banana bread was great to distract our appetites until the food came. 

We ordered the chicken waffle sliders which were great. The Benedict in bed was good, however I would have appreciated a little syrup on the side. The California omelet was a great size and tasted delicious. The strawberry and Nutella French toast was perfect. S'mores pancakes were slightly on the drier side but still worth it. Lobster Benedict was additionally a wonderful dish. I appreciated the attention to flavoring and crispness they provided for the home fries, my favorite indicator for an establishment overall. 

Our experience was ideal and we will definitely be coming back for more."
10,North Street Grille,5 star rating,3/10/2021,"Definitely one of the best brunch spots in Boston! 

I kept seeing posts about this place on Instagram and I needed to try it out for myself. My boyfriend was coming to visit, so I made a reservation for weekend brunch. You will definitely need to make a reservation, this place is popping on the weekends. When we got there, we were seated immediately. The place is rather small and there were plastic dividers between the tables for covid safety, but the tables were still pretty close together. This wouldn't be the place for someone who is more weary about the pandemic. 

My boyfriend and I knew right away what we were getting as I had stalked the menu beforehand. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. They even brought out fresh banana bread to the table while we waited for our food. Brunch isn't complete without and mimosa and theirs were delicious!

We ordered the chicken and waffle sliders and the cinnamon roll french toast. Both were AMAZING! I was super excited for the chicken and waffle sliders and they did not disappoint. It is such a fun concept! The sliders also came with potatoes which were out of this world! Definitely need to go back and get a whole order of those. The cinnamon roll french toast was pretty sweet and heavy, which my sweet tooth boyfriend loves. Everything was perfect and we went on a long walk afterward to burn off some of the calories that we had just consumed."
11,North Street Grille,5 star rating,2/16/2022,"Although the wait times at North Street Grille are abysmal on the weekends (likely upwards of 1 hr for a party of 2 for brunch), I really do need give north street grille 5 stars. The food was inventive and delicious and I cannot say more for the waitstaff. Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and helpful. I got the chicken and waffle sliders for my meal and it was wonderful!"
12,North Street Grille,5 star rating,8/13/2021,"came here for a birthday brunch with a few others. the wait is LONG. i called about 45 minutes ahead of time, which they said would be good for a group of 5. got there and then had to wait another 15 before they were able to seat us. space is very cramped

everyone got different things and while i don't remember exactly which dishes people got, i do remember everyone loving their dishes and loving the spot. my close friend got the chicken and waffles, which he said was 4/5 and i got the s'mores pancakes and a s'mores milkshake. they were both so decadent and amazing and i didn't finish either of them because of the quantity

another friend tried to ask for a surprise cake slice but as they're a brunch place, we got 3 different flavored pancakes with candles on top instead and the pancakes were amazing and were a good treat for the birthday boy

staff was friendly, service was quick, and food was delicious. the wait was long and you have to plan accordingly, but definitely would come back again!"
13,North Street Grille,4 star rating,2/8/2022,"The place is really small but the food and customer service make up for it. Food was delicious except for the 3 cheese mac, unfortunately it was horrible."
14,North Street Grille,4 star rating,8/8/2021,"The first thing that I will note about this place is that you will NOT leave hungry. The portions are as hearty as it gets! The menu is really priced to perfection, because you're getting a HUGE value for money with what you're getting. It's a great place if you're looking to have a nice breakfast on a budget. 

I feel like their best offerings are their omelettes. I had their crab omelette, and it was delicious! It was loaded with crab and served with home fries and toast. Honestly, the portion was so big that I could've shared it. Their home fries are delicious, and their corned beef hash is also tasty.

The one thing that fell slightly short for me was the Belgian waffle, My sister ordered a Belgian waffle that she said didn't quite feel like a Belgian waffle, as it wasn't as big and fluffy as a traditional one. It looked like a regular waffle. The pancakes were delicious, though. 

The service was great. Our server, Owen, was incredibly friendly and helpful. So the service definitely matches the food. 

As for safety, there's plastic dividers are provided on the side of the outside tables. There's also plastic dividers for the tables on the inside. I will add that the space inside is incredibly tight, so I recommend eating outdoors. Reserve in advance, as these folks get incredibly busy. There's only one restroom inside for everyone and it's right next to the kitchen entrance, so just bear that in mind for when you arrive. 

Finally, I will note that this is a mask-less environment, meaning that most of the staff does not wear masks. If you're sitting outdoors, then you should be fine if you're vaccinated for Covid-19. Indoors is a much tighter environment, so if you're not comfortable at a place where the wait staff generally doesn't wear masks, just bear that in mind.

Overall, I highly recommend the place. The food is spectacular. The only thing that I recommend tempering expectations on is the Belgian waffle, as it's really more like a regular one. Everything else is spot on! This is a must do for a breakfast place. I just highly recommend reserving outdoor seating."
15,North Street Grille,5 star rating,2/15/2021,"LOBSTER BENEDICT LOBSTER BENEDICT LOBSTER BENEDICT!!! You all must try North Street Grille, I just had the best Benedict nothing will ever compare LOL! No but really, wow! The amount of lobster is shocking, the eggs were perfect AND the potatoes!? That seasoning YES! 
My boyfriend had the peanut butter French toast that he said was the best he'd ever had 
AND the banana bread they start you with is the most moist! The staff was great 
Must visit YES YES YES"
16,North Street Grille,1 star rating,7/16/2021,"Environment: nice and cozy. 
However, it's obvious that Boston have better brunch options. Don't waste ur time for waiting, not worthy. 
Food: They forgot add the sauce on lobster Benedict, the muffin was dry and overcooked. 
I understand busyness around midday but umm..never mind. 
Service: messy and rude. Split the water over the table, leaking on my feet without apology. Btw they don't add water unless u asked. 
And the most upsetting moment, the waiters was judging me just behind my back, excuse me? If you have the prejudice problem please don't expect customer gonna be the big tipper. The relation of consumer and business is the bilateral interaction, and unfortunately they don't achieve that goal, I don't pay for this kinda experience. 
Tbh, we tried so many brunch in Boston; most of them have better quality than this."
17,North Street Grille,5 star rating,1/5/2022,My favorite spot to recommend when people ask for recs for Boston!!! This place was so so good. Parking was crappy and definitely make reservations. So many awesome drink options. Lobster Benny was to die for and anything dipped in nutella is a no brainer for me
18,North Street Grille,4 star rating,11/28/2021,"This was our first meal in Boston and it was a great place to start. I had the burrito pancakes, which sounded so interesting I just had to try it. I'm glad I did because it was good! The menu is large and has something for everyone."
19,North Street Grille,4 star rating,5/15/2021,"Solid spot for breakfast with A TON of options!! I got there just a little past 8am (when the open) and it was already basically full inside, but there's plenty of patio seating. Plan accordingly if you want a seat since it gets busy QUICK.

I was overwhelmed with all the options that they have because they offer soooo many things. I heard a lot about their CHICKEN AND WAFFLE SLIDERS so I knew I had to get those- although I felt like the flavor in the fried chicken was lacking, but as a slider plate overall, not bad! The CINNAMON ROLL PANCAKES were so fluffy and delicious. I'd say def share the pancakes cause it's a lot to finish all on your own. The NUTELLA AND STRAWBERRY FRENCH TOAST was delicious too, and it was stuffed (pleasant surprise for sure). 

I think this is a really fun place to go with some friends since they offer a variety of different options and drinks. It's a tad on the pricier side (not by too much, but notably a little more than some places I've had in Boston). I would definitely want to try the other dishes here, so next time I'll make sure to get some other stuff!  Specifically the savory dishes like their eggs Benny, which I'm sure I'll love.

All in all, worth the trip to the North End for some 8am drinks and yummy options. If you have a group that has a wide variety of taste buds, this is the place!!"
20,North Street Grille,5 star rating,5/4/2021,"This spot is AMAZING. Before even sitting down, I was impressed by the service and accommodation of the staff. One of my really good friend's whole family (of four) flew from California to Boston for their daughter's third open heart surgery as it was high risk and the team at Boston Children's Hospital was the best. My husband and I drove from NYC to Boston to provide moral support. The surgery went well and she was able to be discharged early. We wanted to all have brunch together to celebrate before their flight home. Being so popular, all the tables were fully booked at North Street Grille, however Paul told me he would do his best to accommodate our group of 6 (four adults, two kids). It was windy outside and he was able to squeeze us into a corner booth. The whole staff was so friendly and kind and attentive, it made me so glad I could plan brunch and take off this small burden off their list of things to do/focus on. It was made possible by the kindness of Paul and his staff. Absolutely phenomenal.

The ambiance was ""weekend brunch chaotic"" in the good, ""pre-covid"" kind of way. Screens were in place to section off tables, outdoor seating was available and plenty of hand sanitizer. The whole place felt clean and safe. Took us almost 20 minutes to order (two kids under 3yrs old will do that!) and there were so many delicious options, it as hard to choose.... but again, the staff was so patient and kind. I ended up getting the lobster benedict (very generous portions of fresh lobster, hollandaise sauce was so good!) and my husband got the chicken and waffles. My friend got the eggs florentine and her husband got the sweet and salty sandwich. Their son got a bacon wrapped dates, and their fantastic banana bread (he's a picky eater, lol) and some apple juice. It was an amazing last meal together, made possible by the team at North Street Grille. As our friend's daughter will have to make regular trips back to Boston (since the heart valve replacement can't grow as she does) we hope to have many future visits to Boston and brunch at North Street Grille will definitely be one of our stops!

THANK YOU PAUL!!"
21,North Street Grille,5 star rating,11/1/2020,"The start on my first visit was a little rough, but the food was amazing enough that I am willing to be forgiving, at least this time. 

When my friend and I sat down, we decided rather quickly, and had to wait an inappropriately long time for even our drink (coffee) order to be taken. Once we had ordered, it was uphill from there. Other than that, the service was nice. 

Coffee and food came out without too long of a wait. Coffee was pretty standard, nothing worth writing home about. The Chicken and Waffle sliders though... let me you these things are amazing!

The waffles themselves were nothing remarkable, but they're not supposed to be. Chicken is hot, fresh, slightly crisp, and very tender! Cheese and bacon add a nice touch. First visit had sweet potato home fries, second had regular home fries. Seasoned very nicely (though I preferred the sweet potato fries). Also, that spicy maple syrup is awesome to add some sweet and heat!"
22,North Street Grille,1 star rating,10/3/2021,"Made reservations as we were coming into town for a trip. When arrived, the staff mentioned they have no reservations and would not do anything to accommodate us. Everyone in the restaurant declined having any knowledge of speaking with us when we called to make the reservations. 

The hostess made sure to let us know they were short staffed and really could care less to make an effort to accommodate us even though it was their fault. 

Note: Make sure you triple check that your reservations are made and you obtain the person you spoke you. 

Or better yet, make reservations at another restaurant."
23,North Street Grille,3 star rating,12/12/2021,"Came here for brunch on a weekend. Had to reserve multiple weeks out, and when we got inside it made sense. Super packed, small dining room. Got crab cake Benedict and banana bourbon French toast. The crab cake was good but I was disappointed that the egg yolk wasn't runny at all. The potatoes that came on the side were just ok. The French toast was fluffy and the banana and bourbon syrup were great, would definitely recommend getting this on the side/to share. The server was friendly and attentive. Overall, for having to reserve so far in advance and the price tag, probably won't be going back."
24,North Street Grille,4 star rating,4/17/2021,"Super hot spot. The restaurant actually gave our seats away to someone with the same name so we didn't have a table. They were kind enough to have us wait for a few mins (luckily) since a table was leaving and give us the booth that usually seats more for us. We got the half pitcher pineapple mimosa, it was great. He got chicken and waffle sliders and I got lobster eggs Benedict. I do not regret paying more for it. Food was great. Only con... quite pricey. Somehow ended up spending over $70 so I would probably come here if I had guests in town"
25,North Street Grille,3 star rating,2/15/2021,"Pre-COVID-19 review: I was so excited to try this place as the menu sounds mouthwatering, but my friends and I were let down. The wait time is staggering--we couldn't believe that we decided to wait almost an hour and a half for brunch, but we had already tried and failed to come here once, so we wanted to stick it out this time. We were eventually seated at a counter by the entrance, and not only were we constantly jostled by people walking past, but we also got the drafty cold air every time someone walked in or out, which was all the time in this busy restaurant. 

Everything on the menu sounded so good, but I eventually settled on the Crudite French Toast because I had never heard of anything like it. It's an ingenious combo, but the execution was lacking. The amount of brie was puny, and the French toast was just alright. For what was essentially French toast with some sliced apples, walnuts, and brie, I could make a better version of this at home without the long wait and $14 price tag. My friends both got omelets and agreed that they were pretty standard. None of us thought the food was worth the wait. 

Given how great the reviews are and how good the menu sounds, I still want to come back and try the other specialty pancake and French toast options, but I'll definitely be doing it on a weekday."
26,North Street Grille,5 star rating,7/29/2021,One of the few places that are open early in the North End. Came here around 8:30 and there were a few people already there. They do offer outdoor seatings. We chose to sit inside but regretted it since it's pretty small inside. We sat at the bar counter. I ordered the Lobster Benny & my friend ordered the Apple Cinnamon French Toast. The lobster were meaty and eggs were perfect. My friend also enjoyed the french toast. Tarty & sweet. We were both surprise on how huge it was when the food came out. Big bang for your bucks! It's a solid place for some breakfast before exploring.
27,North Street Grille,3 star rating,3/13/2022,"Brunch here is overrated. I had a reservation and when I showed up the table wasn't ready which is ok but the hostess was unapologetic and unwelcoming while I waited outside in the cold. Once I was seated, I ordered the North End Benedict and there were some basics that the restaurant did not get right. My coffee was extremely weak and the poached egg was over cooked so the yoke was not runny. The menu also said there's a ""pesto hollandaise"" on the Benedict which means they sprinkle some basil on regular hollandaise. The menu felt too extensive for the restaurant and they should scale it back to prioritize quality over variety."
28,North Street Grille,4 star rating,9/29/2021,"This was a great brunch spot! I really liked all of the options here. Get here as close to opening as possible- there wasn't a long line around 8.45. If you can make reservations, you definitely should! It's also a good place to go if you're planning on doing the freedom trail."
29,North Street Grille,1 star rating,7/15/2021,"I saw the online recommendation to come to this place and I was full of expectations for his food. But when we arrived there, the waiter's attitude towards us was completely different from the attitude towards others. He was very enthusiastic about other tables and ignored us. I was order The lobster egg benedict but the lobster is not fresh. i dont recommend here."
30,North Street Grille,5 star rating,2/1/2021,This was the best brunch I've ever had!! It was such an extensive menu. I'm sure ANYONE could find something they like. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The restaurant just feels like a place you want to go back to everyday. The iced coffee was a great start to the morning and the north end Benedict kept me full all day. It was so delicious and filling. We got way too much food for the two of us but it was so yummy- we couldn't help it!!
31,North Street Grille,5 star rating,12/9/2021,"Only day off this week and got up early treated my Momma to breakfast, Paul our serve was warm and friendly it was about 8:30 am only two other party's in the restaurant, it started to fill up quickly it's a small cozy spot, our server was so friendly and excellent customer service! I got the Banana bourbon French toast plate with over easy eggs and crispy bacon, my mother got Banana bourbon pancakes with crispy bacon. She is a tea drinker and they had plenty of different kinds of herbal tea selections to choose from! I had cup coffee. The give you a complementary bowl of home made banana bread 3 pieces it was warm and moist and delicious! The French toast & pancake's both come with a freshly made to order Bourbon sauce with real bourbon in it wow! Both dishes delicious! French toast slices are huge! Couldn't eat all of it, so brought the rest home, the bacon was cooked perfectly crispy well cooked thoroughly! Paul our server was great always getting re-fills of coffee, we will be back again for breakfast this was amazing and very happy with the food & excellent customer service!"
32,North Street Grille,5 star rating,9/6/2021,"Back in Boston over Labor Day and we had to stop at our favorite spot for breakfast, North Street Grille. They took advantage of the great weather and had outdoor seating, although we got a table inside, first available and all. I had French toast and 2 sausage patties and my wife had the cannoli pancakes. We also shared a mimosa half craft. It was All delicious and Meagan was an excellent waitress. I would highly recommend this place for breakfast or any meal of the day!"
33,North Street Grille,4 star rating,11/28/2020,"- Food was delicious ; the blood orange mimosa was great too but the chicken and waffles was a little dry for me

34,North Street Grille,4 star rating,8/11/2021,Nothing special for brunch. Don't really know what people like there. I expected higher quality food. Don't think I will back. Good service though.
35,North Street Grille,5 star rating,11/7/2021,"Took a chance as a three on Sunday morning about 8am. The entire day was full with reservations but after about a 45 minute wait they accommodated us.  So many brunch items to choose from. We had Meatlovers, California and Veggie Omelletes w/greens, toast and potatoes. They were hot, big, fluffy and delicious. Very happy we were able to get in. Hope to try some other items another time. Enjoy!"
36,North Street Grille,5 star rating,12/10/2020,"Absolutely outstanding!  Safety for covid is a high priority here. Plastic partitions between the tables. 

Corned beef hash Benedict was amazing and homemade from scratch. My husband had the prosciutto and fig Benedict.  Again. Off the hook good. 

Home fried potatoes were crispy. Potions perfect. Service staff obviously loves what they do. 

We ordered a sandwich to go and three homemade banana breads."
37,North Street Grille,5 star rating,9/22/2020,"This was an awesome place for breakfast, especially when limited restaurants are open during COVID that has indoor and outdoor seating. Expect to wait in line as it's always packed, however, it's totally worth the wait!
We came here as party of 8 on a Saturday morning. Luckily we only waited for 20 min before we were seated. They had to break us into 2 tables due to seating limit of 6, but they seated us next to each other. 
Our waiter was very nice and quick to take our drink orders: kraft of pineapple mimosa, yum! Bonus - they serve everyone with a bite size homemade banana bread which leaves you salivating for more...  
Between all of us, I had a taste of the french toast (crispy with frosted flakes outside and chewy on the inside - sooo good), lobster benedict (chunks of fresh lobster, perfectly poached eggs with yummy home fries), smoked salmon Benedict (also delish), and lobster omelette... I don't think you can go wrong with any dishes. 
This is a perfect way to start your day in Boston!"

39,North Street Grille,5 star rating,11/17/2021,"Deeelicious! We tried to get breakfast here one morning and the wait was an hour and a half, so we decided to make reservations for the next morning on Open Table. The food and service was incredible. Our server was Megan and she was so warm and friendly. It was as if we had known each other our whole lives. The food was delicious. It's a small cozy restaurant in the North end. Be sure to make reservations as it gets very very busy. I highly recommend this place. Will definitely be stopping here again on our next trip."
40,North Street Grille,4 star rating,8/21/2021,"Great place with amazing food and so many options on the menu! I ordered the Apple cinnamon French toast which was amazing. My family ordered eggs, pancakes, and the chicken and waffle sandwich - everyone loved what they got. My only slightly negative side would be that they wouldn't seat me without my entire party (my parents were trying to find parking) and then gave up my reservation at 12:00 when my parents arrived at 12:07. however, we were seated 10 minutes after that and the staff was very kind. Would definitely recommend but know that it is BUSY."
41,North Street Grille,4 star rating,9/3/2020,"We came on a Sunday. Service was awesome. We were seated outside . We ordered the Boston cream Pancakes, sweet & salty sandwich, Benedict in bed and chicken n Waffles. The presentation on these were amazing. My chicken n Waffles was tasty. The chicken was crispy and moist. The waffles was buttery,.crunch and delicious. It was about $12-15 per dish but worth it. Definitely will be back"
42,North Street Grille,4 star rating,9/16/2020,"Came here with my boyfriend, his son and two of our friends for brunch. After seeing all the good reviews for a brunch spot, I decided we had to check it out and this place did not disappoint me or my company one bit. I had the chicken and waffles which were so good, I have no complaints whatsoever. My boyfriend ordered the breakfast wrap which he liked and my friend ordered the french toast which was also good. The orange juice is a must with the yummy breakfast!"
43,North Street Grille,4 star rating,1/12/2020,"Be ready to wait in line on weekends.We put our name down and the wait was around 30 minutes for 2 people. Getting a table is harder than getting a seat at the bar. I sat at the bar, but I recommend waiting for a table. The bar wasn't the most comfortable because people will be walking behind you a lot. We came on a rainy day, so the wet coats and bags made it less comfortable.

I ordered a lobster benedict had very generous amounts of lobster. The benedict comes wit home fries which you can add onions, peppers, and cheese to. They came as a side with the Benedict. The home fries were very flavorful. Wish there was more! I nearly went to go try a piece and it was so hard to stop before I finished it off.The lobster benedict was yummy. The bread was saturated in sauce and the plate was very full of lobster.  Additionally, I got two orders of bacon, which came with a lot of bacon. Not the usual 2 strips that diners will give you. Portions are very generous here. There is a restroom. Staff are attentive, cheerful, and polite."
44,North Street Grille,5 star rating,3/27/2021,"One of the Top 10 restaurant on TripAdvisor. Love their egg Benedict and signature chicken & waffle sliders. If you were a cocktail person, please try their milkshake as well."
45,North Street Grille,4 star rating,9/8/2020,"If brunch is your favorite meal of the day you must go to North Street Grille. Reservations are practically required on weekends but easy enough to grab a few days in advance. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Indoor has plastic between tables due to COVID which can be a bit off-putting but it is what it is.

Plenty of brunch favorites to choose from. I went with the strawberry shortcake French toast which comes with either one slice or three. I opted for one since the slices are thick and the dish was on the sweet side. Homemade whipped cream is a nice touch and they give plenty of syrup. Bacon as a side was super crispy and for $6 they definitely load up the plate. 

Service is good but can feel a bit rushed. Then again they ARE super busy so it's understandable. Iced coffee was good but there is a fee for a milk alternative. Overall really solid spot for brunch."
46,North Street Grille,5 star rating,4/17/2021,"Delish and the service is exceptional. One of the servers even took extra time sharing places to see... definitely recommend this place, large menu."

48,North Street Grille,5 star rating,11/15/2021,"Amazing food! The complimentary banana bread in the beginning was a good premonition of how good the food will be, super moist and fresh. I got the egg florentine and I really like the hollandaise sauce and home fries  10/10"
49,North Street Grille,4 star rating,1/23/2021,"2nd time here this month- this time with friends. Same awesome waiter(Paul), same amazing food and drinks. 
#supportlocalbusiness 

Collectively we had coffee, spiked screwdriver(s!!!!) Bloodies, flirtinis and beer. All Amazing. Jalepino poppers (home made) grilled cheese bites (yum) and the best thing I have agian ever eaten the cinnamon roll french toast to start.

Then egg white omlette for me, burgers, wraps and chicken sandwiches all around with bomb fries, rosemary fries and mixed greens. Will be back soon and continue to recommend friends to come here.

They are super clean with plexi particials and adhering to 25% capacity rules."
50,North Street Grille,4 star rating,8/15/2019,"Came here for brunch with my friend on a Saturday morning. we got there around 9 and didn't get seated until 10 which was a bummer. The person at the door forgot our names so we had to tell him after a while that we were still waiting and he said he was sorry that he forgot our names.

Other than that, the brunch and drinks itself was amazing. Their menu was intensive and included a lot of creative alcoholic beverages. If I had came for lunch, I would've ordered an adult milkshake but since it was breakfast, I got the alcoholic iced coffee. It was so good and strong so definitely got my money's worth. 

I ordered the steak tips, egg whites and broccoli which was good. The steak was a little more well done than I wanted it to be but it was still very tasty. 

I would 100% come back. The food was overall really good and the drinks are one of a kind here in Boston!"
51,North Street Grille,5 star rating,4/5/2021,Hate the wait but not more than I would hate missing out on this food. Probably the best brunch place in Boston. Make sure you have a reservation because the lines are no joke but I waited an hour and a half to eat here so that should tell you how good the food is. An incredible variety of brunch dishes and I've tried a few and they have all been delish! Definitely make sure you add this brunch spot to your list.
52,North Street Grille,5 star rating,7/26/2019,"Enjoyed a breakfast at this hidden gem known well to locals! This restaurant is a cafe/diner style specializing in breakfast, but also serves traditional deli and grille items. I stopped by on 10 am, and it was already packed! Not sure if they take reservations, but if you're willing to sit at the bar you may be seated sooner. 

I ordered a roasted turkey sandwich on a croissant. It was filling and delicious! I ordered rosemary fries, but the Parmesan fries looked better. I also enjoyed a latte that wasn't on the order, but they made one on request. I enjoyed a Bellini and mimosa with my meal as well. Carafes are available too!"
53,North Street Grille,5 star rating,8/1/2020,"Ok... Completely unbiased opinion.
This is bar none, the finest breakfast I have ever eaten.
Period.
Full stop.
Let that sink in.
I have been a professional chef for over 20 years. I have never had better.
Amazing....
Service, menu, atmosphere, Bloodys, Mimosas... Chef Robin is now my new favorite chef in Boston! 
Treated like royalty while we were there. Excellent, excellent, excellent!"
54,North Street Grille,5 star rating,12/31/2020,"There is absolutely not a single dish that does not taste good in this place. EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!!! The potatoes are to die for. The eggs are perfect, the syrup is amazing. Oh and their hot sauce! Love it! We took one of our friends here for the first time and he was so obsessed that he wanted to make reservations for every day until his vacation was over."
55,North Street Grille,5 star rating,1/2/2021,Wow just wow! One of the best brunch spots in Boston! Definitely make a reservation as the place is very small with only a few tables. We had a reservation and still ended up waiting 20 minutes but we didn't mind as we were able to walk around the area and see some historical spots. The service here is amazing! Everyone was so nice to us. The food..omg the food was incredible. The drinks were awesome - recommend getting the Bloody Mary carafe.
56,North Street Grille,5 star rating,2/26/2021,"Had breakfast here that served as my meal of the day. Lobster Benny image on Yelp caught my attention. Well, I did have just that. It was an excellent choice. The cook did not skimp on lobster meat. Caught few lobster claws on my plate. The eggs on top were poached just right so the yolk ran as it should have. I loved my morning fare. Emma, the waitress brought me some banana bread pieces. They went with my coffee perfectly. Ah, coffee was good too. As for Emma, she was courteous, and professional. She is part reason I gave the place five stars. I'm bringing my coworkers here next time."
57,North Street Grille,5 star rating,8/28/2021,"We went to the North Street grille this past Thursday. My daughter graduated from college and we wanted somewhere delicious to eat at afterwards. They were serving brunch, as the graduation was at 9:00 in the morning. We got there at noon time. We sat outside in their adorable patio. I love the outdoor seating and what made it so nice was that the road that they are located on is a one way and not very busy. We didn't even realize cars were going by. The food was absolutely delicious!!! Between us we got a variety of breakfast and lunch items off the menu. We couldn't have been happier!! The service was amazing even though they were very busy! I highly recommend visiting the North Street Grille on your next visit to the North End!  You will not be disappointed!!!"
58,North Street Grille,5 star rating,8/28/2021,This the best place for brunch! The stuffed dates are so good! The food is delicious and fresh. You won't leave hungry! Oh and the adult milkshakes are incredible and very tasty. Only downside is trying to find parking.
59,North Street Grille,4 star rating,9/24/2021,"This special was the Vegan Hash.  Not their best production.  It lacked flavor and substance.  The addition of salt, onions, peppers, vegan egg substitute or anything that resembles breakfast food. The home fries were phenomenal,  avocado toast could use some seasoning or a tomato or two.  I'm guessing the rest of their entrees are awesome as it was packed and people seemed to order their bennies a bunch. Food was quick and well prepared. We waited 40 minutes for a table.  Not horrible.  I'd recommend it to a non-vegan person for sure.  No issues with service.  Everyone was nice, polite and helpful."
60,North Street Grille,2 star rating,5/23/2021,"Food was good for the most part. The chicken and waffle sliders were great, except the chicken was a bit dry. Even with the sriracha maple syrup (which was the best part), it was still too dry. Taste and flavors were on point though. Now, onto the service. It was busy, on a Thursday morning. We had been waiting for about 30-40 minutes for our order, and we saw people who were seated after us receive their food. I asked a server if he could check on our order. He peeked his head quickly to the kitchen area and said ""it's not ready yet"" and walked off. Like I couldn't have figured that out for myself. Horrible attitude."
61,North Street Grille,4 star rating,11/22/2020,"My expectations for North Street were pretty high since it's always packed but to be honest I wasn't impressed. The food was good but nothing special, I would probably go again just because their menu is so extensive but it definitely wouldn't be at the top of my list for brunch options in the area. I got the caprese omelette, it was good but came out cold and the bloody mary was also good but pretty average."
62,North Street Grille,5 star rating,9/12/2021,"Great breakfast, service was real good,
The Lighter side omelet was one of the best veggie omelets I have eaten.
Highly recommend"
63,North Street Grille,5 star rating,3/6/2021,"Great brunch spot! I would recommend making reservations if you want to go on the weekend to avoid a long wait time. 

I ordered a cinnamon roll pancake and side of ham and my boyfriend ordered the prosciutto and mozzarella eggs benedict. The pancake was so fluffy and delicious!! I also got an orange juice and a cappuccino - without prompting, the waiter apologized for slow service with the beverages and offered me a free cappuccino to make up for it (and I didn't even think the service was slow in the first place)! 

All in all, we had a fantastic experience and would definitely return to the North Street Grille!"
64,North Street Grille,4 star rating,3/13/2020,The food was great and the staff was really nice and friendly.  I had the banana bread French toast was amazing!!!! The fig and prosciutto eggs Benedict was so delicious. I would like to also share that I have a nut and sesame seeds allergy and they were so efficient on letting me know they cleaned the grille before making my breakfast and I thought was so great!!!! The only downfall is no parking around unless there is a permit parking but it was not that bad we parked and had a short walk.
65,North Street Grille,5 star rating,2/28/2021,Food is vibrant with amazing service. The Australian server is sure to make your day and experience well worth.
66,North Street Grille,5 star rating,1/30/2021,"My friends and I got takeout breakfast here, and this place made it SO convenient. We ordered/paid online, and when we arrived, they had it sitting on a table immediately when we opened the door. It was so easy and so yum!! Large and very filling portion sizes too. Very tasty and definitely will be back!!"
67,North Street Grille,2 star rating,3/10/2019,"Food: This was at best, passing...2.5/5. 
I ordered the Fig & Prosciutto Eggs Benedict and was surprised at how uninteresting it was. The fig jam seemed store-bought (i.e. the kind that contains more sugar than fig) and the prosciutto (the thick kind that tasted more like a ham than a delicate prosciutto) was folded on top the fig-spread bread. There was no additional preparation or presentation. I could have made this exact dish myself in minutes. The poached eggs were fine, and the hollandaise sauce was thick. Overall, there was not flavor at all. 

IMO there is no point in ordering this dish. 

Service: 1.5/5, regretfully. It seems like they can't handle the amount of customers since they kept forgetting about our table and the one next to us. Although the restaurant has room for ~25 people max, apparently some people still get overlooked. 

Other comments which made me dislike the breakfast experience:
1. The bottomless coffee isn't really bottomless if it's impossible to get your waiter's attention. Granted, I could have nagged the servers more, but a) I didn't want to be *that* customer and b) I want an unperturbed experience of how the restaurant usually treats its customers. 
2. The coffee was so, so bland. It reminded me of watered-down Maxwell House coffee.
3. Jam and tea options were the same as what you'd find at a gas station. There was no effort to make the options slightly interesting or gourmet...."
68,North Street Grille,5 star rating,7/23/2021,We arrived right after they opened and were able to beat the line! The portions were very large and everything ordered for our table was great! The home fries that come with most meals are delicious... crispy and well seasoned. Eggs Benedict and French toast sticks with Nutella were yummy too!
69,North Street Grille,4 star rating,10/9/2020,"Everything was delicious. Ordered the French toast crudité, lobster Benedict, chicken and waffles, iced coffee and an apple cider mimosa. Bill was $68 plus change. Would return to try other dishes. All COVID precautions are taken. Thank plexiglass that hangs from the ceiling separates the tables. My only minor complaint is that when sitting at a table for two feels claustrophobic because you're boxed in by the plexiglass. All staff wears masks and they are constantly cleaning. Enjoy!"
70,North Street Grille,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"Great food, big portions, excellent service. Was a crowded brunch morning but the carafe of mimosas and cold Stella made the time fly by before Benedict and omelette were delivered."
71,North Street Grille,5 star rating,4/5/2021,"Short and sweet...BEST BREAKFAST IN AMERICA.

My finance' and I went twice in one weekend. Small places like this are busy but are well worth the wait. We were so hungry that we ate outside in 35 degree weather. Paul was the best waiter. Keep the coffee coming while he stayed out there with us. First day was just a basic scrambled eggs with short rib hash. The home fries are the best out of any restaurant. Crisp outer crust with that soft inside. Eggs were fluffy and very abundant for being 2 eggs. The hash was just amazing. Her Benedict was spot on! 

Day 2 was the baked potato omelette. You know how omelettes go sometimes. Stuffed with everything, too much cheese and just well done eggs? Well not here!! A fluffy omelette with the bacon and chives in the egg, some mash potato inside, cheddar melted on the top with a scoop of sour cream. Hands down the best I've ever had. Hers was the Nutella and strawberry stuffed french toast. Perfectly done with not too much of one ingredient. 

And coffee. The brewed coffee has a great rich flavor. Not watered down like you see at many places. 

I've eaten across America. Hands down, this is the best. I will drive hours to come here."
72,North Street Grille,2 star rating,8/2/2021,"I had a very interesting experience at North Street Grille. I went for brunch and was told the wait was 20mins, no problem! although we were not sat for another hour plus! There seemed to be a hold up with the staff and no one was allowed to be sat for an extended period of time while there were 7+ tables available.  Food was pretty good! The chef knows what they're doing! other then that, i perhaps wouldn't visit again."
73,North Street Grille,3 star rating,1/29/2021,"Excellent flavor, generous portions. Large menu.
All my favorite things

My rating would be a 5 but they ran behind schedule, causing my group to wait outside in the cold for 30+ minutes."
74,North Street Grille,5 star rating,6/27/2021,"This is such a great brunch spot. Make a reservation for sure. I got a make your own omelette with peppers and spinach- it was huge! It also came with breakfast potatoes which were perfectly seasoned. I subbed the toast for a piece of the nutella banana stuffed french toast- 10x better than it sounds if that's even possible. My mom got the 2 egg plate with turkey sausage, potatoes & sourdough toast. Great service and overall experience here. Oh and they brought out homemade banana bread for us to try which was also delicious!"
75,North Street Grille,5 star rating,1/18/2021,"My friend and I had a beautiful brunch here! Amazing food, safe service, will definitely be back!

And don't park anywhere near it if you don't have a resident permit!"
76,North Street Grille,5 star rating,7/20/2021,"Have eaten at NSG a handful of times and each time it is just as good as the last. Was finally able to go to the restaurant itself recently and was thoroughly pleased with my experience. Despite the packed house, the waiters were attentive and the wait time for the food was reasonable. The food itself was great, specifically the Cannoli Pancakes and the Truffle fries are some of the best french fries I ever had."
77,North Street Grille,5 star rating,1/2/2020,"Beware of the line...always a wait but if you or 6 people of more the restaurant does take reservations! Even if there is a wait it is most definitely worth it. So many brunch options! Both for drinks and food. The menu includes everything from classic eggs benny to every variation of the classics imaginable, including quite a few lobster options! Omelette selection is also amazing...10+ listed menu options, and the option to create your own. My new favorite has become the california! It is filled with creamy boursin cheese, fresh avocado, tomatoes, and chive.  Staff is incredibly attentive and considerate, especially in terms of letting you alter and add what you like to any menu item. Only thing I wish I knew of was that they have rotating specials advertised on the chalkboards above the tables! All in all great experience, excellent food and service!"
78,North Street Grille,4 star rating,12/1/2019,"Obviously everyone knows this is for sure... the spot to be.... for brunch on a weekend. They are legit hustling and bustling all AM LONG. Get there and get your name on the list... doesn't matter if you're going with a smaller or larger party, just get it on there ! We waited a half hour in the rain under the awning, it wasn't that bad. Anyway, this little ""OG Diner"" is super small inside... sure sure they have a countertop you can sit at or they have booths that fit like 8 people or you'll be crammed in a table (half booth/half chair) essentially on top of your neighbors... 
Down taaaaaaaa businessssss.... yo, I love a good pancake. I really do.... this one was sub par and cold, now I won't knock them Bc the chicken and waffle sliders were amazing so I will not let that deter me ..... but the pancakes were a flop... But those sliders though !!! You need to come in here and get them, holyyyyyyyy shttttt. My friend and I split both of these plates and she picked the winner. The sliders are huge and everything about them were perfect, I probably would say def add it to the list of one of the best things I've ever eaten. Highly recommend.... we got a half carafe of mimosas and the potatoes that came with it were bosssssss. We crushed our brunch."
79,North Street Grille,5 star rating,7/15/2021,We had reservations and ate outside on a beautiful morning.  The food was amazing.  Great service and friendly staff.  It was worth the 25 minutes of subways and walking to get there.
80,North Street Grille,4 star rating,12/9/2019,"I had breakfast at the North Street Grille this weekend while in Boston. The restaurant is fairly small, so beware of the weekend wait, especially if you are a larger party. Because of the small size of the restaurant, you will have to wait outside. The food is worth the wait. We ordered the build your own omelette and the banana bourbon French toast. Both meals were large, the French toast was so good but sweet so I recommend sharing. Lastly the service was great."
81,North Street Grille,5 star rating,6/12/2021,"The drinks and food is amazing, it's small so I would definitely make a reservation! This is a go to if your in Boston! They have huge booths for bigger parties and a lot of two tops! Service is great as well!"
82,North Street Grille,5 star rating,7/28/2021,I have only ever ordered takeout from here but every time it is SO GOOD. the brunch food is amazing! I would recommend the pancakes or omelettes. This place gets super busy so call ahead or make a reservation.
83,North Street Grille,5 star rating,3/8/2020,"This is one of those ""finds"" that I would say is very much worth going out of you way to get there. When our party of two (can two actually be called a ""party""?) arrived we were told the wait would be 45 minutes to an hour. Being kind of an ass I told my companion, who wasn't there when I was told the wait time, that they said the wait would be 15 to 30 minutes (who wants to walk to another spot then be told it's a 30 minute wait there) and low and behold (a cliche I don't understand) we were seated in 20 minutes. 
So the moral of this story is to not leave and take a walk only to return in 40 minutes because you very well may get in a lot sooner.
Great morning beverages and an outstanding menu.
The place is VERY cozy (meaning tiny) but I really loved the ambiance and the staff is on their ""A"" game!
One small warning of sorts. There is only ONE single occupant unisex restroom so if you have a phobia about such things (which I'm on record as not having such a concern myself) please be sure to ""go before you go""....or at least before you arrive!
Lastly I really like, on the verge of love, the fact that they use cloth/linen (not actual linen) napkins meaning there is just a little less going into the garbage and landfills. They also use paper straws which is also an appreciated item compared to the plastic variety....even though for the vast majority of time I go straw-less on purpose or as some would say ""by design""......"
84,North Street Grille,5 star rating,11/26/2019,"I had a plane to catch and did not want to wait for breakfast here standing outside in line in the cold! I wanted a great meal though and there weren't many other walk to options so I got in line....Lisa took down my name and she played hostess/ line monitor / entertainer and comedian as well! I moaned to her about the line, the cold, my flight and my hunger and she assured me I would leave full, loving the food and still make my flight no problem! 

Seated at the teeny tiny bar, the coffee was phenomenal, the juice was delicious and the presentation for all their drinks was fabulous!! The bartenders were great, the service on point and the food was delicious . My sister had the waffles with chicken and maple syrup and Saracha to dip. She was obsessed. I had a build your own omelette that was the best I've ever had. 

I sang Lisa's name all the way out the door, hugged her  and thanked her as I got into my uber to the airport! 

I will be back!"
85,North Street Grille,5 star rating,2/6/2021,"I was looking for something a little out of the norm and found this amazing cozy spot in North End! The variety in the menu is insaneee but the food is even more insane (insanely good!) Something that definitely caught my attention was the Sweet and Salty sandwich so that's what we got and it was the best decision ever!!This sammy has your typical B.E.C but what makes it special is that it's between 2 slices of fluffy FRENCH TOAST!! The combination was definitely a good one and the maple syrup makes the sweetness really pop in this sweet and salty sandwich. Now for the reason I came here. Chicken and waffles sliders! Yes you read that right, SLIDERS! These sliders were worth the hype and the added cheese is definitely a bonus! The crispy chicken and bacon, the salty cheese and the soft thick waffles with maple syrup drizzled over them? Bite of yummy goodness. Oh and that complimentary banana bread? FIREEE! All in all a great experience and opportunity to support a small business!"
86,North Street Grille,5 star rating,11/17/2018,"Loved it! (Despite the long wait)

Atmosphere: pretty small space filled with people from all walks of life! A lot of young adults. They have a bar w/ TVs and then a bunch of tables packed in next to each other. 

Service: It is definitely bustling! The staff is running around to make sure everyone is take care of. It is pretty old school, they took our names down on a piece of paper and told us to come back in 1+ hours.  Everyone was really friendly! During our wait we visited some tourist sites and it made the time go by quickly.

Food: the food was really good. Hearty and filling. The short rib hash was delicious.  The banana nut bread was also great as a little starter.  The mimosas also hit the spot!

Overall it was great!"

This spot has amazing brunch options. It was busy as soon as we got there but we were quickly sat 5 minutes at our table.

I got the eggs Florentine with salmon. My fav brunch option. The fries what was on point with the added toppings. 

We then got a chocolate chip pancake to share. Best pancake I've had in my life. HANDS down. Highly recommend this spot for brunch.

They have brunch all days of the week also ! :D"
88,North Street Grille,2 star rating,12/11/2021,"If you're looking for a place to feel rushed, have a rude server and feel pressured to eat quickly, this is the place to come!  The food is fabulous, I would definitely come back for the food.  But the service not so much.  If you're not a person to finish your meal in 15 minutes, this isn't your place.  We had not even finished our food or our first round of drinks and our server put our check on the table and told us ""no rush.""  He then returned, took away the bill device and continued to talk loudly to others about how he put the bill down and we didn't do anything.  When he came back with the bill a second time, others followed  and cleared plates... that STILL had food on them.  There's no time limit in place I may add for dining.  Something to think about is how you treat your customers; yes, you want to get more people in the door but I'm not sure if this is how you treat customers if you want them to return. Good luck."
89,North Street Grille,4 star rating,9/30/2019,"Came around 10:00 am on a Friday and only waited about 15 min for 2. We were seated at the bar (although we weren't asked if that would be okay). The staff was really friendly and welcoming. 

We did a  1/2 mimosa pitcher and the bartender was generous with the champagne, which is appreciated. We went with the Boston cream pancakes and cinnamon roll pancakes. We also shared a side of home fries with onions, peppers and cheese. The pancakes were good - they were thick and dense while still being fluffy. The chocolate on the Boston cream was very filling. The cinnamon roll pancakes had a nice cream cheese type icing on them. The home fries were my favorite part - you have to get all the toppings!"
0,Viva Burrito,4 star rating,11/7/2021,"This spot offers all the great options for Mexican food AND booze!

They have a pretty vast menu with many of the fan favorites of Mexican cuisines. The steak burrito bowl was tasty and fresh. I could have doubled up my option, but I also got the nachos that worked out well. The beef nachos were loaded and good portion. It was finger licking good and couldn't get enough!

They also offer alcohol here with beer, sangria and some other drink creations.

Plenty room for indoor dining."
1,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,11/13/2020,"under eight dollars including tax for a veggie burrito with guacamole. Oh by the way, it was one of the best I've ever had.

Roasted peppers, rice, beans, the real deal! I will say the woman in there does not speak great English, and getting the correct bathroom code from her was brutal,

A terrible neighborhood for parking and traffic, but outstanding burritos, and I have to guess most everything else will be good too."
2,Viva Burrito,4 star rating,2/3/2022,"Here's the thing: the food is pretty good BUT...don't go on Thursdays. They continuously mess up orders- different meals, forgotten entrees, etc, wrong order, etc. We have ordered 2 Thursdays in a row. As I said, food is good, but it's disappointing they're not more on top of it. We will NOT be going on Thursday anymore. There's another crew that works on different days and that's when the food is really great, and the service. Had to post because service is SO inconsistent."
3,Viva Burrito,2 star rating,9/3/2021,This was my go to place at work for my burrito or tacos but recently the food hasn't been good. I would usually call it in but lately its never ready ..I usually have to wait longer. The last two meals have gotten me sick. Don't know if they changed owners but they really have gone downhill.  I'll have to go to  Ana's Taqueria which is farther down.
4,Viva Burrito,2 star rating,10/9/2021,Good atmosphere. Chips and salsa were alright but nothing special. Then I had a ground beef burrito no beans and no guacamole. Then I got a very unpleasant surprise THERE WERE PEAS IN IT! WHO IN THERE RIGHT MIND PUTS PEAS IN A BEEF BURRITO. it was straight up disgusting and threw it out.  If your like me  and hate peas next time order a chicken or steak burrito Or better yet quesadilla. Lesson Learned.
5,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,12/1/2020,Very delicious mexican takeout. Everything was affordable and scrumptious. Great flavors and wonderful fresh seasoning. I love that they use fresh lime and cilantro- you can taste the difference. Definitely try the spinach and chicken burrito. My daughter is notoriously picky and she loved it
6,Viva Burrito,2 star rating,12/13/2019,"This place has great location, and splendid interior - One of the liveliest and most colorful - but I can here to try the food. As a fan of quesadillas and burritos, I tried both and sadly was dissatisfied. First in for most, if you are a meat lover and crave those juicy, soft, flavorful bites, yOu will not find them here. The chicken I had at times had bits of cartilage, and was tough and chewy in texture; similar to the steak. The rice and beans in the burrito were very bland and didn't even taste or see any guac in my burrito when eating it.

I will give them props for making their own hot sauce bar. However, like most in making sauces, it can be a flop if you're not an expert in making them. The sauces did not pair well. Some were too vinegary or overly hot to enjoy the meal properly. Even the pickled peppers and jalapeños did not have the right pickled taste to enjoy the flavor you naturally expect. They tasted a bit strange.

It is very catchy to visit when walking by but for those who are considering trying out this place, please keep this review. One last item, more of a slight annoyance - the quesadilla is overly packed. It gets pretty tall at about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch. If you like putting guac, sour cream, and hot sauces on quesadillas, it will be messy holding it up and eating. The sour cream is good though - so I 100% recommend getting it if you do come here."
7,Viva Burrito,4 star rating,5/26/2018,"It's a burrito joint, but not as you know it. Sure, they have the usual traditional ones with chicken or steak or pork and rice and beans and salsa. Or you can wander a little further down the menu for a lamb and spinach or barbecue pork or artichoke and spinach. How about red snapper or scallops and salmon?

So with an eye for something different, today's lunch was the chicken curry burrito. A spicy curry sauce with plenty of chicken but not wet at all. Easy to eat and not drippy, it was very flavorful.

There's also a salsa bar with mild to hot salsas."
8,Viva Burrito,1 star rating,11/17/2020,"One star is a little harsh because this place has potential. My issue is that I ordered the ""viva Burrito"" with blackened chicken breast. Cashier asked if I wanted guacamole and cheese and I said yes, she yells to kitchen ""with everything"". Which included mayonnaise which I did not realize nor was I asked nor is it on the menu. It was nothing short of disgusting because all I could taste was mayo and thru it out after 2 bites"

13,Viva Burrito,4 star rating,1/11/2019,"The first time that I tried Viva Burrito was 10 years ago. I was in a training class in Boston in 2009 and a friend introduced me for the first time. Back then, I thought the steak quesadilla was amazing. Little did I know there was something much better on the menu. 

After seven years stationed in another part of Boston, I came back to this area for several months in late 2015 for a detail. Viva Burrito quickly became one of my go to lunch spot due to the distance from my office and also the quick service and affordable price. It was also in 2015 that my new favorite item on the menu changed to the Viva Fresh Salmon Salad. The salad has grilled salmon, zucchini, yellow squash and tomatoes wedges over a bed of lettuce and garnished with green olives and toasted pumpkin seeds. Best tasting grilled salmon salad I have ever had and I have tried many at surrounding area restaurants that cost far more. 

Fast forward to 2018, I am back and I haven't forgotten this place. The quality over the years have not changed at all. If anything, the menu have expanded and now you can even pre-order your food on Grub-hub and then pick it up. This is great if you work nearby and have a set lunch schedule and also because the lines tend to be very long during lunch time."
14,Viva Burrito,4 star rating,9/19/2018,This is my go to spot if I ever need a quick and easy dinner. It's very convenient for me to get to and it's relatively cheap. The burritos and nachos are decent. I like their quesadillas as well.
15,Viva Burrito,2 star rating,2/4/2021,"I've had a variety of burritos from this place and I've been disappointed just about every time. The rice and beans included in the burrito are nearly flavorless and the meat of your choosing doesn't help the taste very much. I once had the roast pork burrito and I felt like I was eating a bland cylinder filled with tasteless slop. The tacos are decent just because the meat is the focus of the dish. You're probably better off going to Qdoba that is nearby, the ingredients are probably less fresh but they at least have flavor."
16,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,3/21/2020,The steak burrito was almost as good as the steak quesadilla. Hot sauce and avocado top it off.
17,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,7/13/2020,Excellent food here. The chicken & artichoke burrito has been my favorite so far. For the price this is pretty much unbeatable around here. I'm averaging about two orders a week!
18,Viva Burrito,4 star rating,7/28/2019,"I Looove Viva Burrito.  The food is easily five stars. The menu is great.  They have a salsa bar so you can add more salsa to your meal or varied salsas.  The restaurant is a nice space to sit in.  The ladies at the order counter are always nice.  

 One of the few negatives is, if you go in during lunch rush and there are a lot of people there picking up to go food, there is no place to stand while you wait to pick up your food. Because of the weird space you are all over the people queuing up to order or trying to get their soda and it feels stressful because if you sit down then you risk not hearing your order called and having someone else hijack your burrito!!!!

When it's not the lunch rush and it's the late afternoon or dinner crowd it's pretty perfect.  

They also serve beer which is a dine in bonus.  

I have tried and enjoyed many of their burritos but I mostly get the chicken or the rice and beans these days.    

Anyway, good all the way around."
19,Viva Burrito,1 star rating,9/18/2018,"Update September 2018: This establishment no longer holds an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau due to complaints filed. The manager has very poor customer service skills and is inefficient in managing his establishment. 

If I could give zero stars I would. This restaurant may serve good food but unfortunately I was never able to experience it. I placed an order for my office and after receiving a confirmation email, I was called and told that their delivery person was sick and they didn't have any ability to deliver my order. So they offered a refund. TWO WEEKS later no refund. Every time I call and ask to speak to a manager I am told that they are not there and to call back. One person that answered the phone was so condescending they asked, ""You're asking for a refund? How much could you have really spent?"" At 1pm another person answering the phone said, ""Our manager doesn't work mornings. They work afternoons. Call after 5."" This place is impossible. Horrible customer service"
20,Viva Burrito,3 star rating,11/10/2017,"A surprisingly decent taco joint. Don't get the guacamole though! It's super teeny tiny, and as much as I love guacamole, I gotta admit that it's not worth the splurge. 

I ordered the Carne Asada and the chicken tacos, with a side of guacamole. When the kitchen asked me if I wanted to add cheese, I didn't realize it costs extra! I wasn't a huge fan of the cheese, because it didn't really do anything to add taste or texture. 

Both the meats were nicely flavored and I'm happy to report, relatively juicy! Knowing that this is just a local taco place with mediocre reviews, my expectations were pretty low so I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a bad meal at all! 

Drop by if you're craving some tacos. It'll hit the spot! Sort of."
21,Viva Burrito,3 star rating,1/24/2020,It is not El Pelon - my favorite Taqueria in Boston - but Viva is not too far behind.  They make a very good Burrito.  My favorite is the lamb and spinach - the grilled meats for the burritos here are quite tasty.
22,Viva Burrito,2 star rating,8/10/2017,"After eating here a few times, gotta say, not that great. Expensive, cheaply made burritos. Granted, they are decent sized - but the taste & cost to size ratio just isn't there. Ordered it via delivery the second time, missed a few things I asked for.

The first time I went I ordered the 12"" Cajun chicken burrito. Wasn't bad, pretty decent.

12"" Steak burrito I ordered with about $6 of extras had a huge chunk of nasty gristle & inedible meat. Ruined it for me. Won't be going back. For a $15 burrito & a $30 order, I might as well have gone and bought all the ingredients and made a bunch of them myself.

Granted, I'm accustomed to San Diego & LA. North East just bombs out on Mexican food."
23,Viva Burrito,4 star rating,9/10/2017,"Yo, this place is about as good for Mexican food as you're gonna get in Boston. I'm pretty picky about my Mexican food too, being from Southern California, and Mexican.

 It's affordable, the service is quick, and the employees are friendly. They made the burrito right to my liking. I'll definitely be back to have another burrito. It's the first place here in Boston that marinates their carnitas correctly, annnnd knew what a wet burrito was. 

Will definitely be back."
24,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,8/17/2018,"I LOVE Viva Burrito. It's a blessing that it's in walking distance of my work. The salsa bar is awesome, the staff is lovely (even despite the stress of the fast pace) and portions are always huge. The meat is perfectly cooked and seasoned and real-- definitely an upgrade from any fast food place. I also love the variety. They have everything, from your plain rice and beans to a fancy scallop dish with a fresh fruit smoothie. It's so affordable and always super fresh, so it's worth the couple of minutes wait for my food.

If you love yourself, get the roast pork in anything and heap on the pico de gallo. Hits the spot every time."

26,Viva Burrito,1 star rating,3/12/2020,"Placed an order over the phone for myself and my coworker.  Both orders were wrong.  Since I called it in, I thought it would've been ready, it wasn't. Which was a good thing. They had my order wrong and when I told the guy, he had an attitude. Questioning me like it was my fault. We get back to work and my coworker order was wrong as well. Hers was already packed when we got there so we didn't see hers. 

So I call and explain and the woman that took my order answered and she was equally rude as the guy I spoke to while I was there. 

Never again will I give my money to that establishment. They don't appreciate their customers"

Salsa bar = really bad (taste...blech!)  
Tacos = terrible (overcooked chicken bits and paltry filling) 
Chips = inedible (stale Tostitos)  
Rice = tasted like curry...WTF?  
Service = poor (cook got annoyed when I ordered, then asked for chips and salsa first - told me to wait for the rest of the food.)
Price = expensive for crappy food.

Sorry, not trying to be mean, but this place is bad...really bad.

28,Viva Burrito,1 star rating,1/19/2019,"Well if I were to compare  Viva burrito to anybody I would say they are sub par to Taco Bell I had their nachos and it was no better than a nacho that my three-year-old could make in the kitchen.

For the cost it was a little cheaper than niko's but you get what you pay for me it was unedible as it was chewy and you had to keep spitting it out so don't order the carneous sada because I don't think it's Carney I think it's dog meat.

As for the bean and cheese burrito for the kids it was your garden variety out of the can but it wasn't the good canned stuffAnd the breeder was about a 4 and a 1/2 inch burritoAgain Taco Bell least has the sauce to go with it and has more flavorI would Not recommend this to my worst enemy.

Go the extra few miles to niko's or Taco Bell"
29,Viva Burrito,3 star rating,6/13/2018,"Pro:
1.) Very good food.  I really enjoy the burritos, soft tacos, the caesar salad (yes, I understand that's an odd choice at a Tex-Mex restaurant), and the salsa bar.

Con:
1.) The staff is very very slow.  The place is almost always packed at lunch time, because their food is good.  There's a big state building across the street, and Massachusetts General Hospital is within walking distance.  There are frequently a lot of customers waiting patiently for their order, meanwhile the staff are chatting (which likely slows them down).  My supervisor got so frustrated with their service, that he won't go anymore.

2.) One time, a staff member at the register was too busy texting on her cell phone to notice that I was standing in front of her.  I ordered food and a soda.  She didn't give me a cup to bring to the soda fountain machine, and when I asked she didn't know I ordered a soda.  Clearly her text was her priority.

3.) Orders should be prepared on a ""first come, first served"" basis, but I frequently see customers who ordered after me, get their food before me.  Also, it's become more and more obvious that customers who are fluent in Spanish and are friendly with the staff, get their food a lot quicker.  My colleague, who speaks Portuguese, Spanish, and English, went to Viva for lunch right after I did (I had to wait at least 15 - 20 minutes).  She got her lunch within a few minutes."

I order a steak and chicken plate fajita and received a wrap and had to order extra steak for the delivery minimum and totally upset right now . Never gonna order ever! But thanks for all the aluminum wraps and brown paper bag maybe it will come to use when I need my gel manicure removed haha"

Positives - 
The food was pretty good. The prices were decent

NEGATIVE - 
The guy who took our order was a complete jerk. He just had a scowl on his face. He was not patient, and did not want to answer any questions that we had, not that we had many. And it wasn't even busy at the time. The guy was just a miserable pr!ck. There is a lot of competition so close by, next time i'll go somewhere else and get treated with respect."
32,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,4/14/2019,"A few years ago my mom used to get us this as a treat, chicken quesadilla with nachos and guacamole on the side. It has been more than 12 years since I had this and while In the neighborhood asked my husband to see if this place still exists. I am surprised that the taste of this quesadilla is still just as delicious. The flavors taste fresh and not heavy with grease as sometimes many burrito and tacos places do. They have a fresh sauce bar and now that I can drink noticed they sell home made drinks and beer. I will definitely be stippling by here over the summer while out in Boston :)"
33,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,4/6/2018,"This is a great place to grab a bite, I love there fajita! Way much better than the chain restaurant. 

I live in the building so it is very convenient to order a take-out. The service and environment are ok, but good food is always more important than anything else. 

Don't ever doubt if you are a foodie."
34,Viva Burrito,4 star rating,11/8/2019,"Place is nice and clean. Staff are nice and helpful! I had a steak taco salad and a a burrito. The salad is kinda disappointing with just little bit of steak (wish there was more, especially that it was more expensive than other type of meat) and the dressing was boring and didn't taste special. The burrito was okay, though I had to pay for guac and extra sour cream, and I'm not sure it was worth it. They also have a small salsa bar which was cool!
It wasn't too bad of an experience."
35,Viva Burrito,1 star rating,3/21/2019,"This is such an extremely unprofessional place of business. They messed up and forgot an order and instead of reimbursing the forgotten order, they insisted that I pick it up. It's no good to me as I don't have time to eat because my lunch time is over. Danny, the manager, is responsible for this policy. He stated that the entire order would have to be returned. This is simply despicable behavior - don't bother ordering from here because if you're dissatisfied, you're not getting your money back."
36,Viva Burrito,3 star rating,10/12/2019,"Being from Latin America I love to have myself a nice home cooked meal when I am away from home. My American friends suggested I try their food which I did. They were quick to deliver my food through door dash, and they cooked everything well to the T! I was a little disappointed my food was cold but that's not their fault I would think since it was delivered. Also the pico and the meat and beans was really good the rice was a no go. I did not like that it was not well seasoned and it seemed like it had frozen veggies in it. And if you're looking for real Mexican food this is not it."
37,Viva Burrito,3 star rating,3/14/2019,"Visiting from out of town and saw this burrito joint down the street, so I stopped in for a quick burrito to go. They didn't seem busy when I got there, but it still took a bit of time for my shrimp & scallop burrito to be ready. The place did fill up fast after I ordered, because there were a bunch of Celtics fans fueling up before the game. The staff wasn't very friendly or welcoming, and the burrito was just average. I liked that they had a wider variety of burrito fillings than most places, and the prices are totally reasonable, but there's just nothing outstanding to make you want to go back. Also, I got guacamole in my burrito, but I honestly don't know if it was in there... if it was, it was such a small amount that I couldn't really tell. Next time, I'd probably try out Anna's Taqueria which is not far away."
38,Viva Burrito,1 star rating,5/16/2020,I came in last week worst customer service cashiers don't seem to care about you i speak Spanish so I understood everything that was being said about me I told the cashier I DO NOT WANT CHEESE the cook put cheese and I heard the cashier tell him that she forgot to write no cheese and she said to him in Spanish just give it to her she won't notice. Extremely bad customer service really bad attitude and I definitely will not be coming to this business again if I could put 0 stars I would.

41,Viva Burrito,3 star rating,11/25/2017,"Oh viva viva viva. I'm so torn on this review, I love your food as burritos go you are five stars. But when it comes to delivery that's where you fail me. 
Don't get me wrong this place is awesome, they're  great. It is just so busy they can't handle the volume. Even when you go in the wait is long. So the missing two stars is based solely on the poor delivery options : calling in/being on hold forever! Or ordering online and not having a way to convey all special order items you want. And when I say special I actually mean simple like quac on the side.
 This review is only for the lunch time, not at dinner time."

Had to wait about 10 minutes for my food, but it was definitely worth the wait (and I had a glass of house made sangria while I waited so all was well!) I ordered a steak burrito bowl without the tortilla bowl but with guac and sour cream, and collected a few additional salsas from the salsa bar to add some heat. Definitely recommend."
45,Viva Burrito,3 star rating,9/13/2018,This burrito place was ok.  I prefer the places where you can specify the contents of the burrito as they make it....these guys asked almost nothing about my order to get it right.  The large was gigantic and it was a flavorful steak burrito.

Tried the chicken soup once because I was coming down with a cold. Great choice! Not your mama's chicken soup - unless she's Mexican and a VERY good cook.

If you like what's in the dish you can't go wrong.

Great tasting, filling food at great prices. Value for your money.

I do wish they offered other items from the menu through peach like the tacos or tortas."
51,Viva Burrito,4 star rating,8/10/2016,"Viva burrito ranks up there for one of the, if not my favorite burrito places in Bahston.

What makes Viva burrito so fantastic you ask? Well, let me tell you. First off, they have an awesome variety of burritos. Not many burrito joints offer shrimp (which is one of my favorite ingredients in burritos), so bonus points from me for that. Secondly, they've got a salsa bar, which, its a freakin' salsa bar, which is amazing. 

The flavors from Viva burrito go very well together, you can taste the freshness, and since they have the one-of-a-kind salsa bar, you can add on all the delicious salsas and sides that your little burrito heart desires. 

I typically get the chicken and shrimp burrito, which while it isn't overflowing with shrimp, it is well balanced, and even with guac comes in under $10. 

The location is great for anyone near MGH, and its got pretty good hours too. 

If you haven't swung by Viva burrito yet and you consider yourself a burrito maniac like myself, do yourself a favor and check it out!"

They offer really amazing food at prices lower than at  Qdoba and Chipotle!  Try the enchiladas, the sauce is YUM! 

It's got more to offer than the average mexican place in terms of the options and has some really tasty offerings! I don't know how they manage it at the price but if I worked in the region, this would be an often frequented lunch spot.
With burritos, bowls , enchiladas and everything else at around 5-6$, it's really quite a find!"

58,Viva Burrito,1 star rating,2/17/2014,"Next to bad food, nothing prompts me to write a review faster than bad service. This place was both.

Ms. 1-star customer service took my order full of attitude. I asked her how much guac was in the guac&chips versus just the guac. Sure she ended up telling me what I wanted to know, but not without making sure it was the most condescending tone that I knew guac by itself didn't have chips and chips by itself didn't have guac. While waiting for my order, I also witnessed a customer complaining to her that he ordered the seafood burrito with just shrimp. He'd gotten a mixed seafood burrito and she argued that since he said seafood burrito with shrimp, it'd meant he'd get seafood. And though I hate to poke my nose into other people's business, you can look at the menu and see that ALL seafood burritos are listed under their seafood section, and then you can specify the seafood...just as the customer did. She just kept arguing with him until he gave up.

My guacamole was a sad green color and tasted terribly sour. I don't think it was bad--just that they might've mixed it with salsa. It was also obviously over-blended. Also if their ""large"" is this size, I'd hate to see their small. I've uploaded a picture with a spoon for comparison. One scoop and that thing was gone.

The flan tasted like a sweet omelette with light caramel topping. The bottom was also REALLY hard. Bad baking? or has it been sitting too long?

I've no idea but I won't be trying to figure it out. Nightmare."

I ordered the enchilada plate and out came a depressing plate of two enchiladas with cheap cheese sprinkled on it. Ummm you couldn't broil, nay, even microwave the plate to melt the cheese?

As I took my first bite I knew we had made a huge mistake.  Awful doesn't even begin to describe this embarrassment of Mexican food.  COMPLETELY flavorless pork inside my enchilada, shredded beef that tasted eerily similar to chinese beef jerky and literally flavorless refried beans.  Not an ounce of salt was used to make the plate.  The rice was also disgusting.

I am a heifer.. I never leave food.  I left over half of my plate which goes to show how God awful it was.

I just can't with you anymore Boston.  I am officially on a Mexican food strike until I get back to LA."

Then, my enchiladas were cold, the extra sour cream o asked for on the side was not there, and the onions that we asked to NOT be put on the salad were on the salad. I hate onions and they were very potent, adding both an onion aroma and flavoring to the salad. In addition, the guacamole that my wife asked for on her burrito was not there. My wife makes a far better enchilada and she's Irish. Extremely disappointed."

64,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,2/12/2016,"This is a great place if you want good Mexican food at a reasonable price. I come here often when I am hungry during lunch. The portions are huge! I never spend more than $7 after tax for a burrito or a rice plate. If you get steak or shrimp burrito it cost extra and you'll spend closer to $8 for a burrito. I usually get a lamb burrito with a jarritos soda. Other places such as chipotle, qdoba, etc. you'll spend at least $10 and you won't feel as full. They also have a side bar where you get as much salsa and other sauces as you want. They serve alcohol too which is good.

Overall, if you're hungry and don't want to spend a lot of money. This is a great place to go."

So after waiting 30 min total my food was behind the cashier all along it was cold I asked for guacamole I didn't receive any the cashier charged me again for guacamole and on top of all that there were no napkins in the napkin bucket near the door the cashier made me wait another 10 min for napkins WORST PLACE EVER IF I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS I WOULD

Lamb and spinach burrito (with guac): the lamb was perfectly cooked, juicy and well seasoned. Other ingredients were well proportioned and tasty, with a nice hint of cilantro.

We passed it on the way to get some coffee, and then on the way back since we were hungry we stopped by here since I kinda felt like it would be good, on some random hunch. And heck, I was DEFINITELY right. They have a lot of burritos and quesadillas, and interesting varieties of both. I just had the steak and chicken burrito though, while my date had the chicken quesadilla.

My burrito was pretty darn big and filling, so I can't even imagine what the 
""large"" ones would be like! But yeam the steak in it was so juicy, tender, and had a unique flavor to me, not like most places  that just have hard crappy meat. The chicken was also good, and the salsa they put into it was great. They got my order exactly as I wanted it, which was good because I hate guacamole and sour cream. Meanwhile, the quesadilla was a bit crunchy on the outside as it should be and had good cheese, although I think a steak quesadilla would have been better.

They also DO take cards which is a nice change from the other really good mexican place that I know in Boston, Anna's."
74,Viva Burrito,2 star rating,9/16/2015,"First off, Ignore the haters. Viva burrito is not that bad, it's just not that good.

Of all the culinary creations in the world, few single items encompass an entire meal quite like the burrito: meat, beans, rice, salsa, maybe some vegetables, all wrapped up in that versatile food vessel -- the tortilla. In the best burritos, each ingredient stands out in every bite while at the same time harmonizing inside its casing.

When I was young, the best place for a burrito in Boston was behind a liquor store. Now we have them available everywhere.  

Chipotle is ok, but they make their burritos like an over stuffed pillow. Humans can't usually dislocate their jaws and I'm not a pelican. Eating them is a chore.

I want to eat a burrito from end to end. Burritos are not suppose to be eaten like corn on the cob. 

Viva makes their burritos correctly, it's just hit or miss on the fillings. After selecting them, you just hope the flavors don't run around naked inside your stomach with their arms flailing, screaming obscenities. 

But hey. It's better then Taco Bell. Chalupa. Gordita. Names like the sounds drunk people make when they throw up.

So, try them out. Imodium is available everywhere."
75,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,9/4/2018,"The register girls are always extremely nice! They always compliment me on my tattoo's, and always have had a great time there! Good food as well!"
76,Viva Burrito,2 star rating,4/10/2017,"I would have given this place 4 stars; however, the past three times I have ordered guacamole with my burrito they never put it on and it is an extra cost.

The first time they didn't include it I assumed it was a mistake. The second time I thought ""shame on me, I should have checked this time."" However, the third time it occurred it was no mistake. It says it on the ticket and that I paid for the added cost. When I went back and asked the cashier he immediately handed me a container of some.

Just feels cheap to me."
77,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,7/19/2016,"I've only had food from here twice and it's been the same item- taco salad. They taste so good and as long as you place the order for pick up, your food will be ready right on time. I've never sat down and looked at their menu carefully but I've liked what I bought and the prices are reasonable.

Update: I've now order food online as well as eaten at this establishment. I still believe the food deserves 5 stars for the price. But now that I've interacted with the girls at the register, I think they have room to improve. The girls were too busy talking among themselves and ontheir cell phones to interact with me properly. They don't greet you or interact with the customer well."
78,Viva Burrito,2 star rating,9/27/2017,Food was Ok but disappointed with the service. So many employees working and it took over 10 mins for me to have my Burrito which I can get right away at other places like Chipotle. There weren't many people ahead waiting for me or would have been understandable. Not worth my time going back again!
79,Viva Burrito,4 star rating,11/6/2017,"I just moved to the area and haven't had time to try much off the menu yet, but the chicken quesadillas are delicious. Portions are good for the reasonable prices too, although you do have to add things like sour cream and guacamole that might come with this dish at other places. They do offer a free salsa bar in store, and the online ordering system is very convenient. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the menu offerings - especially the smoothies and desserts!"
80,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,3/5/2018,"We love this place. Great flavored, delicious and juicy burritos our favorite is the steak burrito always a crowd-pleaser.  Yummy guacamole as well."
81,Viva Burrito,4 star rating,6/6/2017,"My go to lunch spot near South Station. Big fan of the burritos. Yeah, it gets mobbed and takes awhile, but they're cooking up your meat right there and not pulling it from pre cooked bins. It makes a difference. Good price for the area too."
82,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,12/1/2014,"I love this place. It gets crazy at lunch time, but it's totally worth it. 

You won't find an assembly line of questionably fresh ingredients here. Unlike a well-known taqueria down street, the meat is grilled to order. My favorite is the steak burrito, and the meat is always tender and juicy. Their guacamole is fantastic. All of the ingredients are fresh. The employees are friendly. Prices are decent. You owe it to yourself to give Viva a try. 

Pardon the brief review, but I've got a burrito to get back to."
83,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,2/15/2018,"Coming from the west coast... I found the Best steak taco salads ever! So delicious and the pricing is reasonable. Street parking only, about a five minute walk from the garden."
84,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,5/1/2019,"Excellent food, very reasonable prices and a nice place to sit if you want to dine in."
85,Viva Burrito,1 star rating,10/10/2014,"There is always an issue with Viva Burrito. 

I work in the area and the food is decent, but every time I have gone there has been a problem. Either they mess up my order, or charge me the wrong amount. 

I asked to speak to the manager after this happened a few times (and the time I was grossly mischarged) and he was unbelievably rude and did not reimburse me which I found incredible! 

While I do like the food, I can't go back given my negative experiences there."
86,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,1/21/2019,"Can't believe this place doesn't have a better rating. Viva is our go-to Mexican place in our neighborhood! Quality of food is always great but it's always better to be flexible here because they often mix up part of our order (nothing major, just mixing up refried vs black beans or no sour cream vs sour cream). Their tacos and burritos are excellent, and they somehow have great chicken soup. And their taco salads are amazing. You really can't go wrong!"
87,Viva Burrito,1 star rating,10/13/2016,"NEVER order delivery. I've given them 3 chances and on each & every chance including today they've been 45-60 minutes later than the 1 hour they promise for delivery. Then when the food gets here it's cold, taco shells broken and average at best. Horrible experience and I see no reason to give them another chance ever again."
88,Viva Burrito,5 star rating,5/6/2017,"OK, so the first time I tried this place was a really long time ago and I ordered a burrito. Definitely was not a fan. Fast forward to a few years when I worked adjacent to the place and tried one of my friend's taco salads and holy moly was it GOOD. I think there were a few weeks where I got a chicken taco salad consistently everyday that work week for lunch. They also have a steak option, a vegetarian option and a grilled salmon option for the taco salad. I ordered every one of those options and they were alllll delicious. The salad comes in a crunchy shell and is loaded with ingredients - I mean LOADED. Makes you want to take a nap right after, *sigh*. They also have this cute mini station that is presented with salsa, hot peppers and other complimentary goodies to go on top of your salad (and whatever else you order). Not sure why this place has such lousy reviews, they must have tried the burritos because I totally agree they are very underwhelming. Back to the taco salads - my friend has this theory that when the weather is humid and/or rainy, the taco shell isn't as crunchy so only get a taco salad on non-rainy/non-humid days and make sure to get it with extra guacamole (yum)! I also appreciate the service, all the workers are super friendly and greet you by your first name if you end up going there almost everyday like I did."

0,Bambara,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"Went to Boston for a weekend and wanted a low key dinner with my husband! We were totally happy with this place. The ambiance was so nice from before you even walked in. The walls were used as bookshelves and I thought that was so cool. The food was great too! I opted for the chicken parm and my husband got a burger. Staff was also friendly and attentive. Food was great! 

10/10"
1,Bambara,1 star rating,4/10/2022,"Was only here for drinks only.  But the drinks were terrible.  All Figured Out- the sweet and sour was well balanced but it was so bitter!! Maybe from the lemon rind ?

Old fashion- terrible also. Tasteless and diluted.  
So sad. 

Service was good !"
2,Bambara,5 star rating,11/10/2021,"Efficient | portions | call system  

Efficient - I ordered breakfast and dinner from bombara. Both were super efficient once I talked with the waitress. They have a good menu online via their website and Google. It took about 20 minutes for my food to be ready once I made my order. 

Portions - given where you are located and the price point, you get a lot of value with their meals. I had the French toast and breakfast potatoes for breakfast and the chicken Marsala and a side of fries for dinner. I was more than full. Also I need to shoutout their potatoes. They are delicious. I'm not sure if it's the cut or how they are seasoned, but their fires and breakfast potatoes were the highlights of the meal. Definitely top 10 (maybe top 7) all time potatoes for me. 

Call system - I called the number via Google and their website. Each time I called I got the voicemail after 3-4 rings. I had to call the hotel's front desk and then ask for a transfer for the restaurant and then they answered. I'm not sure if it was a coincidence or standard practice. But it was somewhat annoying. 

Pro tip - if you stay at Kimpton Marlowe, you can have all your meals charged to your room. 

Pro tip - if you stay at the Kimpton Marlowe You can call down and order and they will call you back when your food is ready. 

Pro tip - there is not a lot of parking around there. So I would Uber or walk if you ar going for dinner."
3,Bambara,4 star rating,11/7/2021,"Stopped in to have dinner, and was amazed by the burger and fries!

The burger was super juicy and cooked just perfectly. The veggies and pickles on the sandwich was fresh and crispy. The bun, held everything well together. BUT, I would have liked it to be a bit bigger in size... I like to eat, and when something tastes soooo good, I need more of it!

The fries were super delicious! Hand cut, thick slices, fried to perfection, seasoned with right amount of salt. Crispy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside. Sooooo good!

Only gripe is the menu is limited and small. Would have loved to see more items as the burger was delicious."
4,Bambara,4 star rating,10/23/2021,"(Last visited 4/1/2021.) Working in Boston for the week and I'm staying at the Kimpton Marlowe Hotel right on Edwin H. Land Blvd. Inside this hotel is Bambara, a fantastic restaurant... Let me explain...

Atmosphere/Appearance: Set right inside the hotel is this gem right off of the main lobby. It's in the shape of an ""L"" and wraps around the back of the hotel. The kitchen is exposed, there's plenty of big windows letting in lots of natural light and the restaurant gives off a very elegant-modern feel. It's usually pretty quiet inside.

Service: I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant, but I've gone in to pick up my food then take it to my room multiple times. Yvelisse or Kellie are usually who I see when I go there (been there 4 times) and they've both been very friendly as well as super helpful. 

Food: I wasn't even going to do a review on this place but then I had the short-rib. OMG. The gospel of this incredible short-rib needs to be spread around the globe. Lol. It was so succulent, savory, smoky and practically perfect. I also was able to try their burrata and roasted carrots. Funny thing is... none of those things are on the menu anymore. Lol. The menu changes periodically and you can't go wrong. On my next visit I had the grilled salmon over rice with grilled asparagus and that too was fantastic. It was cooked perfectly, smothered in what looked like a pesto sauce of sorts, I don't know, the chefs just knew what they were doing. Again, no longer on the menu, but I'm sure it'll make a comeback! Last, but not least... the WWWIIINNNGGGSSS! These ARE still on the menu! They're lightly breaded with a teriyaki glaze and topped with some sesame seeds. These were fantastic and something I will repeatedly get.

Value:
Burrata = $12.00
Short Rib = $26.00
Roasted Carrots = $8.00
Grilled Salmon = $26.00
Chicken Wings = $12.00
Asparagus = $8.00
Not cheap here by any means, but this ain't some cheap restaurant. The food is absolutely worth the price.

In conclusion I loved this place and it fits the hotel perfectly. I'll be eating here a lot more in the future whenever I'm staying in Boston.

5,Bambara,4 star rating,3/21/2022,"My friends and I made a reservation here originally planning to do their dine-out menu, but when we actually got there and started comparing menu prices we found that it would be more cost-effective to just choose options from their regular menu. We ordered two apps to share in our group of 3 -- the brussel sprouts and the fried calamari. Both were very good, the calamari wasn't oily at all and the texture was very crispy. The brussel sprouts were so good that one of my friends was seriously considering ordering another dish of it. As for my entree, I ordered the bucatini. Unfortunately I wasn't very hungry when I came into the restaurant, so by the time I had finished my share of the two appetizers, I was too full to eat much of my entree. What i did have of it though i enjoyed. The braised short rib came with pasta, which I wasn't expecting. I enjoyed the pasta because I've never had some with texture like that one. Overall, it was a nice experience, the only minor complaint would be that the entrees took a while to come out."
6,Bambara,5 star rating,7/16/2021,"Another incredible visit tonight. At this point we've dined here so often, it feels like going to a friends house for dinner. What an incredible feeling to walk in and say hello to old friends who know your preferences. Amanda was the warm welcoming committee per usual. We sat with Benny at the bar because the service is stellar. Incredible bartender. Chef Adam was working his tail off, but never missed a beat. Created the yummiest vegan pasta (again). Even took time to deliver our spectacular vegan dessert (off menu). This team works above and beyond if you communicate your likes and dislikes. So grateful to know them!"
7,Bambara,4 star rating,12/19/2021,"Had multiple meals here while staying at the kimpton. The butternut soup and chicken wings were both amazing, as was the French toast for brunch. Good cocktails in a nice space as well. Service is a little slow, but short staffing is the norm these days which I totally get."
8,Bambara,1 star rating,12/29/2021,"Had $20 credit from Kimpton stay, so we decided to pop in to gauge the breakfast. While the view and restaurant decor was nice and clean, the food experience was rather subpar. I ordered an eggs benedict, but 1) my eggs were slightly overcooked (not poached properly) and 2) (never seen this happen before) they forgot my hollandaise sauce. The replacement sauce also seemed a little odd. Not my favorite experience."
9,Bambara,3 star rating,12/5/2021,We got out of work and wanted to skip some traffic so we stayed in the city and came across this place. The setting was very nice and cozy and intimate. Our server was very attentive and friendly which we appreciated. For starters we had the butternut squash soup and my wife had the fried calamari which both were fantastic. For entrees I had the cider porkchop cooked medium which was ok and my wife had the salmon with cous cous which was extremely salty. Food was a bit overpriced as the flavors did not match what we were charged. We didn't notice this restaurant was connected to a hotel which would explain the prices for the plates. Even though the service wad good the was overpriced and probably won't be coming back.
10,Bambara,1 star rating,7/11/2021,"Waited outside to be seated for nearly 10 minutes. We asked the guys outside if someone was working. Felt awkward so went inside to eat. Ordered drinks. Those also took a while but were tasty. I ordered the ""house made fusilli"". I'm posting a photo because I don't think it needs words. Ate a few bites and went to Cheesecake Factory to get the avocado rolls."
11,Bambara,5 star rating,12/18/2019,"Came here for lunch with some coworkers. We were surprised to find this restaurant here upon searching maps. It's on the side of the galleria mall in Cambridge so kind of hidden.

We had a great experience! Very friendly waitstaff and the menu is expansive. Inside the restaurant is a nice vibe that can go casual or formal.

I ordered the pasta, clam chowder and a latte. All items were very well made and delicious!"
12,Bambara,4 star rating,7/9/2021,"Only came for a drink, but stayed for the thick cut fries, which were great. (Thanks as much to the Harissa Aioli as the fries themselves.) They had a live piano (keyboard) singer who was perfectly food, but given the size of the place, I could have done without the Friday entertainment. MAJOR marks for the bartender - somehow she (Amanda - she rocks!) managed to make an Old Fashioned taste like a candy store in heaven - it was traditional, but the 'juiciest' most refreshing OF I've ever had. It wasn't overly sweet - just rich, complex, and... yes - I'll have another."
13,Bambara,4 star rating,6/17/2021,"The service here was a bit slow, but the food made up for that. Every dish we got was very tasty, and we finished all our food with no leftovers. The food was a bit expensive, but it was quite good."
14,Bambara,5 star rating,7/3/2020,"Bambara
On memorial drive, right near the science museum. 

The place here is sadly overlooked because it is in a hotel. The food is out of this world. From the bread that has some nutmeg in it or something to the house made pasta. The chef here really knows how to put ingredients I wouldn't think of together for a perfect bite. The margarita I had was made with grapefruit juice, so a little different, but tasty. The patio is shaded by the building so it stays cool for outdoor dining. I love going here. You should check it out. The pork buns pictured here were the star of this feast- GHOSTFATTY OUT!"
15,Bambara,4 star rating,3/7/2020,"Go-to spot for nice work lunches. The food is delicious and the interior is nice; it's a bit pricey but perfect for a work meeting. My favorites are the grilled cheese and tomato soup, flatbread, and the seasonal salad with salmon plates. After your lunch, they give out complimentary cookies."
16,Bambara,5 star rating,6/27/2021,"Private dinner for 30 this weekend went off without a hitch.  Cocktails and hors d'oeuvres reception in a  modern, elegant room off hotel lobby with couches, small tables, etc.  Seated dinner in the semi-private dining area of restaurant (which felt sufficiently private).  Service was polite, unobtrusive, and paid attention to timing of speeches, etc.  Denis was easy to work with on the menu, and the private dining menu options are good and appropriately priced. A winner."
17,Bambara,5 star rating,5/13/2019,"This restaurant had a great atmosphere. The lighting inside is great and the seating is comfortable. The food came out quick and was absolutely delicious. I got the gem salad and truly enjoyed it. Our server Peter Holmgren was great and checked in on us often. He made sure we had everything we needed to have a great dinner. 

For dessert I got the warm chocolate cake which was the perfect ending to a great dinner. If you are in the Cambridge area, it is a must to visit this delightful restaurant with great service."
18,Bambara,4 star rating,5/30/2018,"We were pleasantly surprised to find such good food next to Cambridgeside Galleria. 

We ordered the salmon ceviche which was a good portion and a mix of all the right flavors including mango, jalapenos, avocado and cilantro.

The chicken breast was very good with a good portion size.

The pesto mushroom pasta was also very fresh and tasty - get the appetizer size so you can try other things. Pretty good portion even as an appetizer."
19,Bambara,3 star rating,3/3/2020,"First and above all, I want to give a HUGH shout out to James, our server.  He gets a 5 plus star rating for all his hard work, positive energy and attention to our group but sadly, and to no fault of his own, he was a victim of poor management.

Went with a group of 8 for Sunday Brunch.  Atmosphere, decor an cleanliness all superb but that wasn't enough to offset the cluster of errors and mistakes our group had to deal with. For the longest time, it appeared, James was the only server to manage many large groups in the restaurant and as I said, he was hustling and working hard.  Four of us ordered items including sourdough bread and then we find out, they are out of sourdough!!  Small detail, I know, but seriously, it's a Sunday brunch hour and one would think the kitchen would be well stocked. Several of us also ordered cocktails which came out after the food was served. And, our dishes all came out at various times with the last of the 8 ( ironically mine) coming with the wrong side item and the food was tasty but several us us had lukewarm food.

But then things really went downhill.  Being a yelper, I naturally checked in and was offered a free dessert for my first check in.  The offer disappeared from my screen and James sent the manager over who stated ""without seeing the offer on my phone"" she couldn't authorize the free dessert.  I pleaded to her common sense, showing her my phone where I checked in etc but she was firm in in answer. Several minutes later she informed me ""I spoke to the chef and we can give you the dessert"" ( not that the chef makes the decision but whatever, she tried to make it right I guess). And the final insult, was THEY CHARGED ME for the free dessert and put it on the bill which I then had to once again, have the manager make the adjustment.  Unfortunately, this place has a great atmosphere and good potential but they definitely need to work on staffing, management and communication."
20,Bambara,2 star rating,12/26/2019,"Eh, not terrible, but weak in too many areas to consider again.  Came here on Christmas with my family.

I had the falafel but I knew to order another side because of the photos showing how little you get on Yelp, so I did. My only major complaint was that the portion size on the falafel dish was absurdly small, and it said it came with squash, but that was really more decorative than edible.  The entire dish was barely enough for an appetizer for 1, let alone a meal for 1.

Fries were listed as herb fries on menu, but were just regular fries.

Other people in my party enjoyed the burger and the clam chowder. One person asked for a small side salad, but all that came, was plain lettuce with olive oil. No joke.  Not a cucumber. Not a crouton.

Service was provided by a reluctant, disinterested server, when we were the server's only customer, and the ONLY CUSTOMERS in the ENTIRE RESTAURANT.

not sure what the hell is going on here, but never will return."
21,Bambara,4 star rating,2/22/2019,"Hugely convenient for people who stay at the Kimpton Marlowe hotel! I had both dinner and breakfast here (thank heavens for their operating hours! so convenient) and enjoyed both meals thoroughly.

For dinner, I made it to their 5-7pm happy hour, where bar apps are half price! Highly recommend the pork steam buns - such fatty and delicious pork!! I also enjoyed their half-size ricotta and goat cheese ravioli (the chestnuts were a bit tough to chew, and things were a tad saltier than I would have liked, but rest assured this half-size portion would probably be enough for you). The persimmon contessa drink was also exquisite.

For breakfast, I had two scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, and sourdough. I was not a huge fan of the eggs; ironically, they could have used more salt. But everything else was great! Best of all, they leave you with a pot of coffee to refill for yourself!!!! Yes!!!!! 

Service is incredibly good here as well! Definitely a fan."
22,Bambara,4 star rating,4/26/2018,"Pork belly steam buns!  Say what?!  I said PORK BELLY STEAM BUNS!!!  You, your mouth and belly with thank me later.  

My boyfriend and I stopped in for drinks and an appetizer before catching a show at the planetarium.  We had just enough time.  The apps were half price (I think between 5-7pm.)  $2 each for this deliciousness?!  So cheap to make my mouth so happy! Just do it folks!  They arrived 2 on the plate.  We each had one.  The sauce... so tasty!  The garnishment did not overpower the sauce.  It was a little crispy but soft inside.  The bun was s-o-f-t!  It was the perfect combination and really hit the spot!  My boyfriend liked it so much I gave him the last little nibble of mine.

We had drinks.  The bartender took it very seriously.  His shook his shakers intently and made me a girly drink garnished with pretty dry flowers (which my boyfriend ended up inhaling which caused shock and me with wet jeans!) But he had some old fashions which he said he did a nice job.  Made me think how were their meals?"
23,Bambara,4 star rating,2/17/2019,"I went here for Valentines dinner. The atmosphere was really cozy and unique. There were book shelves and paintings lining the walls. For appetizers we had the gem lettuce salad and warm hummus platter. The gem lettuce salad was a Caesar salad but had delicious super crunchy croutons. The warm hummus platter was AMAZING one of the best hummus platters I have ever had. The pita had beautiful grill marks and was flavored with this unique zatar spice mix. This is a must have.

For dinner I had the ricotta and goat cheese ravioli and Jack had the chicken breast. My ravioli were amazing they had large crispy pieces of save and this warm butter sauce. (The one downfall were the sliced chestnuts, when they were thin they were an amazing texture but some of them were not toasted enough and were this weird stick in your teeth texture like taffy).

Overall it was really great! I would go back for sure."
24,Bambara,3 star rating,7/19/2019,"Drinks and appetizers were very good but for Martini glass. Service was good too, but our server was a little 'spacey': brought a cup of chowder when ordered a bowl; no big deal (brought a second bowl); asked if wanted another martini, forgetting I had already ordered a cappuccino.   
The worst of it was some patron decided to take off socks and shoes to wiggle toes around on the nice overstuffed chair next to us. Lawless Cambridge? Or is ignorance the mark in the heart of academia?
Disgusting to us no matter how interpreted. We would not go back because of arrogant patrons   Too bad! We must note however that management was right on top of it when became aware and asked the barefooted fool to put his shoes back on. Five Stars for management. Zero for barefooted buffoon! So gross! Where are we, back in the 'third world? There is a time and place for taking your clothes off. Foot-loose and fancy in a classy Cambridge eatery is not the place to be. SORRY!"
25,Bambara,2 star rating,6/17/2016,"My friend and I came into lunch recently, as we work nearby and had never been in. Unfortunately we weren't impressed with our experience. Service was laughable and food was only okay. We would not come back.

My salmon and crab burger did not taste right, though I will say the fries were awesome.

My friend ordered ice cream for dessert and it took the server almost 10 minutes to go ask what the flavors were, and he comes back, VANILLA AND PEANUT....how did that take 10 minutes?! Then he asked how many scoops she wanted. The price on the menu was $7....just give the amount that costs $7??....she said 1 scoop (which ended up being a teeny tiny scoop), and they charged $4? Where did they come up with that? If the price is a set price, just give what the person ordered lol....anywho..

They did give us cookies when we were paying which was nice, unfortunately it took forever to get the check, and once it was time to sign the check we were so over it, and definitely tipped accordingly.

Bummed because we thought this could be a new lunch spot for us...not the case."
26,Bambara,4 star rating,8/30/2019,"Nice hotel restaurant in an area without too many choices. Had lunch with the kids. Solid food. Checking on yelp and get a free dessert, which was a chocolate chip cookie today."
27,Bambara,5 star rating,4/23/2019,My husband and I love Bambara. It's super convenient to get to and the happy hour specials are awesome. Our favorite dish is the pork belly buns and the salmon ceviche. The drinks are great and they even have a non-alcoholic cocktail which is delicious. We love bringing our out of town friends here for dinner or drinks after hitting the Museum of Science or coming back from a boat tour. Brunch is great as well! The pancakes were delicious!
28,Bambara,3 star rating,3/18/2019,"Solid 3 stars. Food was very pedestrian. But at least it was expensive. Yes. Mixed drink I ordered was so weak I had to send it back. Tap beer selection small and tasteless for the most part. Had all 4. Pasta was not exciting. Undercooked and relies on the cheese for flavor. The Chowder made me wish I was back in California. What?!?!  Don't mean to sound mean, but when I'm staying in the hotel and they have my captive audience, I just wish they tried a little harder. 
Ambience was nice. Seating was comfortable. Service was top notch. Won't be returning unless no one else is open."
29,Bambara,3 star rating,6/16/2017,"I had dinner here a couple of times when I stayed at the Hotel Marlowe. The food was not bad but nothing spectacular, especially for the steep prices. I got the burger which was cooked a little over what I had requested. It was under-seasoned and also didn't have much flavor. I needed to get some fries and ketchup in between bites to keep it going which is unfortunate. 

Overall, it's ok but probably worth taking the time to go out and explore some nicer options around town."
30,Bambara,3 star rating,1/14/2015,"After a few months of renovations, my team was looking forward to trying out the ""new and improved"" Bambara! Unfortunately after our visit, I can't say the new Bambara has improved. In my opinion, it has actually gotten worse. Why? No more power lunch. 

The power lunch special was the main draw of coming out here to this otherwise random hotel restaurant in East Cambridge in the middle of the day. After arriving and learning that there would be no special appetizer, entree, and to-go cookie/coffee combo to power us through our day, we were all disappointed. So we ordered 2 salads and a flatbread for the table and an entree each. 

The menu offerings haven't changed very much - they still have some of their signatures such as the salmon & crab burger and the bisque as well as other salad, flatbread, and sandwich lunch options. They advertise one larger entree lunch special which changes depending on the day of the week, but unfortunately on this Tuesday at 1 PM they were already out of the fried chicken. Another bummer. 

Both the chopped salad and arugula salad with goat cheese and beets were large and tasty. Great for sharing! The smoked tomato flatbread was smaller and pretty standard in terms of flavor. As for entrees, they forgot the include the spicy mayo on the salmon & crab burgers. This is one of the main draws of the dish! Bringing it in a cup on the side just doesn't feel the same. The ""spicy"" squash soup was warm and creamy but definitely not spicy. Still good, but I call this false advertising.

Still craving the power lunch ending, we ordered some coffees to go. Overall the food quality of the ""new"" Bambara is similar to before, the service fine although a bit inconsistent, and the deal worse because they no longer offer the lunch special. Serious bummer. We may need to find another regular lunch spot to power us through the workday."

32,Bambara,4 star rating,7/4/2015,"We came here for an early dinner tonight. We had such a lovely dinner thanks to the yummy food and friendly service at Bambara. 

The ambiance at this restaurant was beautiful and the seating is spacious and comfortable. We ordered the chickpea fries with aioli dip to start. The fries were not my favorite and could have used more salt and flavor. For dinner, however, I ordered the beet and goat cheese salad with chicken and my husband ordered the goat cheese and arugula flatbread. Both were delicious! I was so happy with the salad size but I should have ordered the dressing on the side because the arugula was covered in too much dressing. Our server was very pleasant and attentive. He answered any questions we had with the menu. 

I would come back to this restaurant and bring friends with me!"
33,Bambara,2 star rating,10/8/2017,"Food was ok but the real pitfall is the service. We had several questions about the menu that the server answered incorrectly, for example the trio tuna appetizer, it was not citrus flavored in the least it was actually served with cucumbers and apple. After being informed that 1 of 2 entree dishes were unavailable we both opted for the lobster roll. One entree was served with the appetizer, the other had not been delivered after 20 minutes. We asked that it be packaged to go, as we were going to a show at 8pm. By 7:50p the item had not arrived and our server asked if we wanted dessert before bringing the check. UM, NO! 

What we had was ok, but for the price and experience.. don't' bother. Fail. Fail. Fail."
34,Bambara,4 star rating,11/19/2018,"This restaurant is located at the Kimpton Cambridge.  We were staying at the hotel and have visited Barbara few times a day for a quick snack, drinks and brunch.  We enjoyed our experience here. Warm hummus is presented with pita bread that had nice grill marks.  East meets east cocktail is a wonderful aperitif if you are good with a pink drink (whisky and bubbly).  Hamburger with wedge fries is a hearty meal with all the makings of a great burger.  Vietnamese Brunch was a pleasant surprise with delicious fried chicken and pho.  The bartender was friendly and accommodating who allowed for several Japanese whiskey tasting.  Overall a great experience."
35,Bambara,5 star rating,12/10/2019,"We all loved it. Favorite dishes were: Kabocha Squash Falafel, Squash and Ricotta Agnolotti, Roasted Broccolini, Choereg Bread, and the Grilled Pork Chop.    Each dish had unique and delicious flavors. The cocktails we got were also very good."
36,Bambara,2 star rating,11/9/2018,"Nice vibe except for incessant droning background noise / ""music"". Food was ok but not worth the money. Had the lobster roll AQ for over $30 and it was mainly lettuce, mayo and celery with only small pieces of lobster. The dessert was so-so (apple tart) and the coffee was luke warm. The cocktail I ordered from their menu was ""all out."" Overall, nice enough place to drop in with friends after work maybe, but the price and quality make it a not-particularly-great choice for (an expensive) dinner. (Spent $70 a person for s mediocre meal). 
Would not return."
37,Bambara,3 star rating,11/8/2018,"Food here was okay. Husband got the chicken dinner, and said the chicken tasted good, however the rice it was on had a weird citrus taste to it. I got the apple and beet salad, which was nothing special, until I bit down in to a beet and got a bit of grit in my teeth.. I can only assume it was dirt from not being washed thoroughly. The waiter was kind enough to take the dish off my receipt and instead I got the clam chowder which was much better. 
This place was decent for coming down from our room to enjoy a quick meal. Wouldn't advise coming here if you don't need a quick bite near the hotel."
38,Bambara,5 star rating,2/26/2020,"This place was great! As a guest in the hotel it was very convenient. I don't usually expect too much from hotel bars but Bambara is definitely an exception. The food was delicious and fresh, I highly recommend the pork chop. The bartender, Rachel, was delightful. Great conversation and very attentive. I will definitely be back next time I am in Boston."
39,Bambara,3 star rating,8/25/2018,"Six of us went for brunch - a senior citizen, two adults and 3 young adults. Here's our verdict: this place gets 4.5 stars for food and drink and 2 for the unsmiling and slow service. The two eggs option was great. The Armenian sandwich was good but a bit dry - needed more sauce. The burger was good. The salmon/ salad combo was nice. The ricotta pancakes with an egg on the side was great. They gave a great veggie substitute for the salmon flatbread but the waitress seemed impatient and annoyed. Fries were great. Coffee was good so was the Bloody Mary that one of us ordered. 
Four of us would not come back again; one would and one said ""probably""."
40,Bambara,5 star rating,11/21/2017,"Uni Flan was one of the coolest things I've ever tasted. 
This place is absolutely worth a visit if you're in the area and in the mood for something interesting. 
Absolutely love that I ate nearly 8 courses and at no point felt as though I needed to hydrate from all the salt in take. 
These guys understand balance! 
Bravo!"
41,Bambara,1 star rating,2/18/2018,"Very poor service.  If you want a drink within 30 minutes of arrival, look elsewhere.

Parent warning:  Came here with two kids, ordered chicken fingers, and 40 minutes later, with hungry children waiting, they told us that this dish was not available."
42,Bambara,5 star rating,2/6/2016,"I'm obsessed with this place, and I think it is so underrated. They have a great menu and a great space (right by the Cambridgeside Galleria, inside Hotel Marlowe). They have a lot of fresh seafood dishes and seasonal dishes -- things like raw oysters, lobster slides, clam chowder, braised cod, and so much more. I loved the Tuna Tartare and the Braised Cod with shrimp risotto. 

The desserts are also spectacular, and they have a huge selection. We tried the Vanilla Bread Pudding and the Warm Caramel Date Cake, both of which were amazing. They also have a TON of flavors of gelato/ice cream/sorbet including nutella, apple cider, chocolate, and olive oil."
43,Bambara,2 star rating,7/19/2019,"I went during the week for lunch, the had a pre fixe menu which was horrible it barely had any variety. The choices were a salad, salmon or burger and I'm not sure if they had anything with chicken. Will not be going here again because of that. The server was quite nice"
44,Bambara,5 star rating,4/9/2019,"I took a chance with this restaurant today and it was the best decision I made.  I order teriyaki chicken wings and a burger it was delicious. The service and quality of the food was unbelievable. Peter, definitely provided excellent service. Thank you  for the great experience. I will return soon"
45,Bambara,4 star rating,1/26/2016,"Good portions for the prices. Conveniently located next to the Cambridge side galleria, inside hotel Marlowe. They offer valet parking at the hotel,but they use the same garage as the galleria which is affordable.Basic brunch menu with enough options to please most.

We ate at 1pm, I ordered a smoothie with soy milk it was average. I ate grilled cheese and tomato soup ! Perfect winter comfort food! Big portion!

My fiancé ordered a egg, bacon, cheese, burger which looked huge and he said was tasty. Once we ordered food did come out quickly. 

Our waitress was kind, but lacked basic waitress skills such as checking in on us, or taking our order promptly. 

Overall the food was good! I'm looking forward to coming her for dinner or drinks. Love the decor!"
46,Bambara,4 star rating,12/29/2016,"Bambara is a pretty wonderful place to grab breakfast in the Cambridge area. It's a bit off the beaten path, but I'd encourage you to make your way to that strange back door area of the Galleria to find this gem.

The space itself is just that - spacious. The hues of blue throughout the restaurant add to the environment and create a relaxing, comfortable place to enjoy a meal with friends. A few of us came here for a pre-holiday breakfast and from the start, I was impressed with the menu items. They were decently priced, and I struggled to find only one meal to choose because I was debating among a handful.

Because I wasn't paying (thank you, company card!), I splurged on the lobster omelet. Usually when I order a dish from the sea, I expect minimal protein. Bambara didn't skimp on the lobster OR the eggs! When my plate came out, I started to sweat a little bit because I didn't think I'd be able to finish the entire omelet. Lucky for me I have an endless pit for a stomach, so none of the delicious meal went to waste. The lobster was fresh and came in nicely sized chunks; the eggs were light and plentiful; the taste was well-balanced and not overly seafoody.

Enjoyed with a mimosa, this made for a great start to the work day. So if you live/work/loiter in the area, I'd recommend dropping in for a bite or seven of some on point eats!"
47,Bambara,3 star rating,6/6/2013,"Bambara is a restaurant inside the Hotel Marlowe, a Kimpton property.  Although nothing fancy, it is definitely a step above a generic hotel restaurant.  Bambara serves regular food and does a decent breakfast, with a la carte as well as buffet.    I stopped in on a Saturday evening for drinks and on Sunday for lunch just before checking out.  

For a hotel bar in Cambridge, it was quite busy on Saturday night.  There were a few large parties hanging around the bar, watching the hockey playoffs.  The bartenders made some pretty good drinks and were attentive.  For my lunch visit, things were a little rocky.  There was a very large party (20+ people) at the other end of the restaurant, so I figured I was going to get poor service.  I waited 10 minutes to be greeted after being seated, not cool.  However, after I was greeted, I was well taken care of by the staff.  I ordered a cheeseburger and fries.  The food was good, but nothing special.  I would not consider Bambara a destination restaurant, but if you are staying at the Marlowe or across the street at the Royal Sonesta, this is a good, convenient dining option."
48,Bambara,5 star rating,6/5/2019,"I had a meeting at the Marlowe Hotel where we rented out the hotel. The staff was amazing and made our guests feel so welcome. The absolute highlight of our time was Bambara and more so Rachel our bartender. She took care of our group and made this meeting truly memorable. Without hesitation, I would come back here."
49,Bambara,5 star rating,3/8/2019,"Everything about this eating experience was amazing. The decor; the service; the food. We had this fresh salmon ceviche with some sort of jalapeno and lime. The beet risotto with scallops cooked perfectly. The warm hummus and the choereg are a must, and so is the mushroom fusilli pasta dish. The way the flavors come together makes you think you can just definitely eat more because you don't want it to end. My girlfriends and I cannot wait to go back."
50,Bambara,3 star rating,1/18/2017,"Had the opportunity to come here a few times with loved ones and it's really a surprisingly little corner.

The decor is lovely and interesting, the general vibe of the restaurant is great as the hotel Marlowe attached is quite fantastic as well.

The food is good, nothing terribly amazing or memorable but good. My issue was the service was less than enjoyable to be around and their lack of speed really drags on the evening. It shouldn't take 20 mins for a refill of water, should it? I don't think so! Their flavors are fresh and the food is what you'd expect to pay given it's a hotel venue, though personally not too worth the price. 

I felt the portions were terribly skimpy and it's quite pricey for non-artistic presentation. If you're going to give the small portions the price should reject and the general ambience doesn't scream expensive so it's strange. Overall I didn't mind it but can't say it will be my go to place!"
51,Bambara,2 star rating,7/11/2017,"My family and I, a party of 6, recently went to Bambara for my mother's birthday dinner. We had never been but were excited to try a new place.

The ambiance was very hotel-like and not cozy or charming at all. The menu looked great but there seemed to be something off with every dish we had. I'd say we all agreed it was fairly mediocre. 

My main qualm was the service. Our waitress was almost comically bad. She was condescending, unprofessional, and overall annoying. She definitely made the restaurant seem much less sophisticated. She would say that the food would be out ""any second"" and it would come 20 minutes later. But more than that, her personality and comments made us all very uncomfortable. 

Overall, Bambara was a very underwhelming dining experience. My mother was disappointed with her birthday dinner, and the food and the service both left a bad taste in our mouth."
52,Bambara,3 star rating,11/18/2016,"For a hotel restaurant, this place is alright. When I'm paying $8-$11 for a small dish of vegetables, my expectations go up. I had bread, the braised greens and the chantenay carrots while my date had a few oysters and the mushroom tortelli. 

The bread was amazing-- basically a dry croissant flavor/texture. The greens I would have preferred to just make at home (to add some flavor and soften up the toughness of them a bit). The carrots were fantastic-- a hint of Indian spices with a beautiful pesto on top.

Our service was prompt, the atmosphere quiet, and the booths quite comfy. Definitely worth the trip but probably not worth a repeat."
53,Bambara,2 star rating,12/11/2016,"I've come here several times because I love their Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. I have to say that it's always decent to exceptional. Today was a Decent day. One egg was over cooked and the other under cooked (runny whites). They already emptied the fry oil and my friend couldn't get fries with their sandwich, which they told us after they substituted fruit without asking him. And I hate to say it because the people are nice, but the service absolutely sucks. I always have to wait at least five minutes for someone to speak to me after I've sat down, but for some reason they are very attentive to making up the empty tables. It's all about the appearance and less about the actual eating experience. I will come back, just less and less frequently until the service improves. 

As we continue to wait for my friend's fries 10 minutes after we have finished eating everything else, it makes me change my original 3 stars to 2."
54,Bambara,4 star rating,11/6/2017,"First time at Bambara.  I went on a busy Monday night.
I happen to be staying at the hotel that's connected to the restaurant and it was a cold, rainy night, so I thoughts I'd stay in.  To sum things up, the food was good, not awesome, but good and the 4 stars were because of Patrick the bartender the night I visited.
It was full, so I sat at the bar and was greeted by Patrick who was awesome.  No pushiness and very friendly even on a busy night.  I had a Makers Mark manhattan and checked out the menu.  I eat gluten free, so after browsing my options I settled on an item from the bar menu, the Hanger Steak.  After telling Patrick I was gluten free and knew I couldn't have the Fries, he checked with the kitchen and they'd suggested mashed potatoes.  Good to go.
The meal was good, again, not awesome, but good and arrived in the right amount of time.  

I appreciated Patrick's friendly help and will return the next time I'm staying nearby."
55,Bambara,4 star rating,3/24/2019,This place is mediocre for brunch but I was not able to get there for dinner since we stayed at the hotel across the street. I would still recommend this place since the staff and locations were really nice.
56,Bambara,2 star rating,10/1/2010,"No, no no no and no. I should have known better, this place clearly is a hotel restaurant and because of it, is in business mostly because of the patrons staying at the hotel. I've driven by it a thousand times and only went there because a friend had one of those social coupons for us to redeem.

Upon entering, we were seated right past the bar in this very comfortable booth. The atmosphere is nice, the place sleek and clean; very welcoming. I glanced at the silverware which I thought was absolutely hideous and glanced at the menu; seconds later I settled for an arugula salad which came with a tiny little piece of fried goat cheese and some walnuts. The dressing was great, the walnuts were candied and offered a nice contrast to the arugula but the goat cheese was meager in portion. Tiny! Like... seriously? Why bother? Did the goat run out of milk? 

Then came my entre. Honestly, I've had bad risottos before, but this one was one of the worst I've had. Their exotic mushroom risotto was absolutely gross. The rice was undercooked and was almost crunchy. My dinning companion sampled it as well and confirmed that it wasn't my taste buds playing a trick on me. At $25 of pop, I was very, very disappointed. And there was supposed to be some kind of foie gras butter, whatever that is. I didn't see any of it or tasted it. The only thing I did notice was a giant, oily ring around the edge of the risotto. A big, green circle of chive pesto. It was more like chive oil and it brought absolutely nothing to the dish except maybe for esthetics - Either way I wasn't thrilled.

Add to the fact that the staff brought us the wrong entrees - dumping them and promptly walking away without giving us a chance for them to fix their mistake - It made for an awkward few seconds. 

This restaurant falls short on quality - and the prices are high for what you get. Honestly, it's a shame considering how well they are located and how plentiful parking is in that area, whether you park at the Cambridge Galleria or near Lechmere. A real shame."
57,Bambara,2 star rating,9/25/2017,"Situationally, I think this probably is a reality every where in/near Boston, however, it does shape my view of this restaurant - and I'll say it is actually very unlikely I'll ever go back.

So, my friend and I went to Bambara on Saturday at about 1:30pm for Brunch.  Neither of us had been there before and the menu had some decent options for someone with a gluten intolerance, so we figured we'd give it a shot.  We walked in expecting there to be a crowd - brunch in Cambridge at 1:30pm - people like to drink.....NO ONE was there except for the cooks (the kitchen was exposed).  I waived, they waived back it was a good moment.

My friend and I are immediately attended to by a really sweet waitress and we order bloody mary's, i get the eggs benedict with fruit, my friend gets a really awesome omelette with fruit...it comes in ok timing.

We eat and eat to our hearts content - because the food is pretty tasty and we are pleased.

This is when two other patrons have shown up and are sitting at the bar, our waitress doubles as a bartender and my friend and I are just chit chatting as we wait to wrap things up.

Out of the corner of my eye, I see a quick movement.  Not thinking anything of it, I turn to look.  Of course, it was a MOUSE.  Just sitting there as bold as he pleased in the dining room watching me (ok it looked like he was watching me.)  I'm not a big fan of the Mickey's and immediately motion to my friend and put my feet up (again, not a fan of Mickey).

My friend went over to our waitress to discreetly let her know (so as to not freak out any of the other two patrons). 

To be fair, our waitress and the Manager on duty were extremely apologetic and ended up comping a big portion of our meal - it felt like it took forever for them to decide and I was so ready to pay full price and beat feet (I ate ALL of my meal - it was tasty, I'd have paid 100%).

Also to be fair - I didn't get sick from the food (and I was waiting for it).  So maybe it's not an infestation...or maybe it is.  I'm not going back for sure.

The two stars instead of one star is solely for our waitress who was calm and grace with us in the face of Mickey's grand entrance.

58,Bambara,3 star rating,7/2/2014,"Popped in here for a post-work sponsored dealio. That means-I didn't foot the bill, we had a limited menu, so I can only comment on what I had.

Blasphemy, I know, but I ordered steak. It was prepared a perfect medium rare - my salad? Perfect. Desert? A sampler - which was fine.

They had a nice selection of scotch, an okay selection for beer.

Being a ""hotel restaurant"" it was better than I expected, but it's not the kind of place that screams ""bring a date here!"" - except, I guess, from what I'm reading, you want to show off how much money you can spend on dinner."
59,Bambara,3 star rating,9/3/2017,"Stopped in for dinner while in town.  It seemed to have nice ambiance, quickly seated with friendly wait staff.  The drink menu was small and prices were slightly elevated for the portions you receive for both.  I was a little disappointed with my meal, which was the house smoked salmon.  I wasn't aware it was an appetizer and was not very filling.  The salmon was nicely prepared however. I was also disappointed in the Riesling, which tasted more like a house Chardonnay. Nice ambiance, however the meal and drinks were just ""so-so"" for me."
60,Bambara,2 star rating,8/6/2016,"Great brunch but they desperately need a bartender on duty. The waiter had to make Bloody Mary's himself and as they are the best in town he was constantly making them which left the poor guy no time to actually be a waiter! The waitstaff does not help each other, when one is busy the others just stand around chatting. When you ask one for something they say"" I will tell your server"" instead of just helping out. How hard is it to grab an extra napkin even if it's not your table? Also, there were two tables that were not bussed at all the entire time we were there. Whatever waiter had that area was losing money but didn't care enough to clean off the table. 

Poor Louis, he tried so hard. If management could get the team to act as a Team, and hire a brunch bartender this place could be one the next hotspot for brunch."
61,Bambara,5 star rating,9/4/2017,"Went here with a friend for Sunday Brunch because of the look/feel based off the website, and it's proximity to the Hampton Inn in East Cambridge. Overall I think it's a great spot and if I were to ever be in the area again I would absolutely go back. I love the atmosphere of Bambara - it's very classy looking. I was disappointed by the fact that there was almost no one there though, and curious why? Perhaps location? Too bad!

I had their Eggs Benny and chose smoked salmon instead of ham because it stood out to me as something a little different. The English muffin was plentiful and delicious, hollandaise was on-point, and the eggs were cooked precisely to my liking. There was also a heaping potion of smoked salmon, I definitely got my money's worth. It came with like 6 tiny pieces of potato which is really my only complaint- they were SO good I wish there was more! 

I definitely recommend this place - there's an executive chef!"
62,Bambara,3 star rating,8/4/2018,"I wanted to love this place because I saw it on a well-known foodie Instagram, but it was mediocre at best. The French toast looks beautiful, but the taste left something to be desired. My husband got the ham omelet, which was extremely over cooked. We aren't super picky people at all, but this was a subpar experience. Not to mention, the service was not great. We sat for a very long time during different parts of the meal without ever seeing our waitress (10 minutes to take a drink order, 30-40 minutes to get our food, 30 minutes to get our check, etc.). Look up how/where to park to get here. We didn't do that and ended up sprinting through the rain"
63,Bambara,5 star rating,9/28/2019,"Terrific dinner. Hummus was awesome, all food cooked to order and the waitstaff was awesome. Easy dinner where we were staying after a long drive in. Would definitely come back."

65,Bambara,4 star rating,9/28/2018,"What a pleasant surprise this place was! The atmosphere is a little stiff, it definitely feels like in a hotel bar; however, the food is absolutely delicious! A+ on every single item! We ordered the tuna tartare, the ceviche, a hummus plate and a pear salad ( I forgot exactly the name of the dish). Every single one was absolutely amazing! I am not easily impressed but this was the best food I had all week for sure. I would def recommend this for date night, the place is quiet and you could have a nice conversation with your date or business dinners, the atmosphere would be suitable for that as well. If you a fan of pitta bread, you gotta try theirs!!!"
66,Bambara,4 star rating,10/27/2013,"Came in for a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised. A lot of times hotel restaurants lack ambiance, service and quality...but not here!

We sat at the bar, as per usual, and had excellent service from a bartender who made some killer Mojitos! Ordered a few plates to share including a grilled cheese, soup and a side of their garlic fries (which btw are like crack addicting) which were served promptly & piping hot!

Next morning we also came in for breakfast and went with the buffet, which again was right on the money! All the food was fresh, flavorful and there was a variety of options. Table side coffee service and juice options were also a nice touch.

Best part is if you are staying at the   Hotel Marlowe you can use your Kimpton In Touch Members $10 reward toward your bill!"
67,Bambara,1 star rating,8/5/2018,"My experience with this restaurant was pure disappointment. They talk about the chef and how great he is... sorry but is a lot bulls**t. The ravioli tastes like nothing, can't believe the price I paid for a plate of mushy pasta with a insipid sauce. The salmon was dry and the portion was really small. I mean if you're going to charge what this restaurant charges you for almost any plate you expect certain quality and above all that what you eat has a taste. If you go to Bambara think again... it's really an overrated place,  you can eat much better for less (or even for the same amount, but the food actually worth it) both in Cambridge and in Boston . The only good thing I have to say it's that our waiter was solicitous. That's all. 
Summary: the food is not worth what it costs. They DEFINITELY have to improve this aspect if they want people to come back and not destroy them with the reviews"
68,Bambara,5 star rating,9/1/2019,Outstanding customer service provided by Chanel Alex  & Jasmin. The Marlowe is very fortunate to have them!
69,Bambara,3 star rating,4/20/2016,"Stopped in for a late breakfast with the family before going to the museum of science. This seems to be one of the only places within walking distance, so we have it a try.

The food actually  exceeded our expectations, the caramel French toast was great, as was the omelet that my wife ordered. All the dishes came with lots of nice, ripe berries which was a pleasant surprise. The service however, was lackluster at best. We had several different people helping us, they were mostly uncommunicative, and then we went for 15 minutes without seeing a single employee. I had to go into the attached hotel to find someone so that we could get a check. With good service, would have been a solid 4 stars, but was dragged down to about a 2.5 I'll round up to 3 in case it was just an off day."
70,Bambara,5 star rating,2/16/2017,"Music and sport channels playing in a intimate lowlight atmosphere. Friendly staff and an awesome unique tasting menu that ranges from vegetarian, seafood, and couple meats.  You can tell this menu was created for show and flavor and everything between $8-46$"
71,Bambara,4 star rating,3/21/2014,"Four stars for great service! The order took much longer than it needed to about an hour and 15 minutes and therefore part of my order was comped; I didn't ask for it they offered and I found that really respectful. Because of their customer service I will eat there again this weekend. 

The Lobster bisque was smooth, delicate, almost velvety with a hint of spice. I wish there was chunks of lobster in it though. 

The Arancini was the best thing we ordered. Wonderful taste, crispy, and the short rib pairs well with the sauce

The Helen's pot roast had incredible mashed potatoes & wonderful vegetables; the sauce was the star but there wasn't enough sauce, and therefore the pot roast ended up being really dry at some points. I wouldn't recommend the pot roast it wasn't bad but I think they have better."
72,Bambara,3 star rating,7/12/2019,"As others recommended, the hummus was great - very hot grilled pita with delicious crispy green vegetables. My partner's grilled salmon was also excellent - lovely crust and flavors around the quinoa. Unfortunately the past, my cavatelli with lamb was woefully undercooked. I complained and was told it was ""al dente"" and could choose something else. My sense of al dente is not of hard (almost couldn't bite through so tough and rubbery) pasta, but I guess the chef has the say. I decided to try to eat it since nothing to eat all day, and in the end they didn't charge me, although would have paid. The apologies from the manager and wait staff (her's sincere) were appreciated. Would come back, but will stay away from the pasta."
73,Bambara,5 star rating,5/28/2019,Delicious happy hour meal in the bar area. Delicious steak with wine sauce and asparagus. Yum. Service was lovely as well
74,Bambara,4 star rating,10/10/2012,"This joint is the bar/restaurant attached to The Marlowe (quite possibly my favorite hotel). Having been in many, many hotel bar/restaurants, my expectations were not high. I am happy to say that Bambara exceeded most of them. 

The service was actually excellent. Attentive but not pushy, always there with the check when I needed to run, and the bartender actually makes an excellent ""Manhattan on the Charles."" 

The food is solid overall, and the bar menu is full of snacks that I would happily indulge in. I actually came back a bit late one evening and was looking for a small bite as I watched the Giants lose in heartbreaking fashion to the worst human beings on the planet (read: Philly). 

The kitchen staff were gracious enough to keep the kitchen open just for me (much appreciated), and I ordered the burger. At $6, I figured it was a little slider type deal. Nope. It was a solid size with a good bun and excellent toppings. This makes absolutely no sense in a restaurant where a standard, two-egg breakfast is $13, but I'll take it. And it hit the spot. And I'd do it again."
75,Bambara,5 star rating,10/30/2018,"So you're thinking- ""hotel restaurant? Pssht, can't be anything special"". This spot is a discerning palate's heaven. The dishes are so well composed and thought out. The flavor pairings are unexpected and perfectly executed. Had the ceviche with a lovely acidity and some semi-spicy radish to even out the wonderful sweet earth of the persimmon. The pumpkin falafel was moist and flavorful accompanied by a bright yogurt sauce. The fusilli: Oh my god. This dish knocked it out of the park with wonderful notes of smoke and a tender cooked mitake that gave the plate complexity and life. I could go on. Absolutely in love with this chef's vision and execution. The passion for food is totally apparent and refreshing. Must try."
76,Bambara,1 star rating,4/5/2015,"My Fiance researched this place, so we came for Easter brunch.This place is located within a hotel and appeared to be very nice when we arrived. We were sat at a table and the brunch was served buffet style. Not our favorite setting but the place appeared to be nice. 

They had different stations set up with omelets made to order, smoked seafood, salads, meat carvings, traditional breakfast fare and deserts. Everthing seemed promising. Once the waitress delivered our complimentary mimosas, we were off. 

The food was mediocre to say the least. The girl at the omelet station couldn't make an omelet to save her life. The worst part of it was that she didn't fold the omelet in the pan, she folded it on the plate, WITH HER HAND. Yes ladies and gentlemen, no gloves just her raw, bare paws all over our very unattractive egg white veggie omelets. Not wanting to cause a scene, we graciously took the food to our table, sat it down but of course didn't eat it. We told the wait staff who removed the failed omelet and notified the manager. The manager stopped by and apologized and offered to personally make us omelets, which we declined. A bit later the omelet girl appeared to have put gloves on and learned what a spatula was. Great news for everyone else!

Good thing there were other food stations full of mediocrity for us to partake in. However brunch was all but ruined at that point. Knowing the place was a bit pricey even made it harder to stomach. But we snacked on fruit, tried the crab cakes Benedict and a few other things not worth mentioning. Overall a very ""blah"" experience. 

I'm not sure if this situation was the result of the restaurant trying to overachieve for Easter or if this is the norm. Either way we won't be back. They did give us an extra complimentary mimosas for our troubles. But the fact that the girl thought it was perfectly ok to handle food that way, was a bit scary. Thanks but no thanks......"
77,Bambara,4 star rating,9/23/2014,"We stopped into Bambara during restaurant week but opted for their regular menu since the offerings seemed a little dull. 

It's a very clean and warm space with a beautiful open kitchen. The seems almost a little gloomy, but the lighting plays it off well. I ordered a steak salad while my partner in crime went for the salmon burger. The steak was beautifully prepared over a well dressed salad. His burger was devoured quickly so I can only assume he'd agree on the quality of the food. 

I removed one star from this review because our waiter was not as attentive as I'd have liked. Our drinks were refilled only shortly before we asked for the check.

But all in all, the food was delicious and it's a very enjoyable space for lunch."
78,Bambara,2 star rating,12/30/2016,"Food wasn't bad, but the bartender had a major chip on his shoulder and was plain rude. No cocktail list, no waters in an hour and we was the burger near come out of a plastic wrap. Time to get local."
79,Bambara,3 star rating,7/8/2012,"Stopped by on a Saturday night for a couple of drinks and found this place desolate, with only a few people around. Perhaps others were driven away by the surly waitress we encountered. 

She was the only one attending the door and the tables, and was inattentive and rude from the start. She was also poorly dressed in a tank top with a purple bra underneath that showed off more than we wanted to see. She spent more time arguing with one co-worker and talking loudly with another than she did attending to her work. She slapped down the menus, shouted from another table, ""Ya wanna get another?"" and slammed our drinks down without bringing the water that was asked for.  She was unprofessional in a place where we have usually encountered a polite and polished staff. 

Better staff training needed around here. Our last few visits have made us feel less interested in keeping Bambara in our neighborhood rotation."
80,Bambara,4 star rating,1/17/2017,I've stayed here several times and have eaten in the restaurant more than once on each trip. It seems to keep improving. Tonight's meal was really great.
81,Bambara,1 star rating,12/2/2017,Service was rude and aggressive to the members of our party. Several people from a wedding held in the hotel also were in the bar and experienced the same treatment.
82,Bambara,5 star rating,8/6/2017,Very good food and very nice waitstaff. Definitely will come back. Not a drop of food was left on our plates!
83,Bambara,3 star rating,2/24/2019,Went for brunch the food was good I just really felt disrespected when my girlfriend ordered a Mimosa and it was literally like 3 sips worth of liquid and they have the nerve to charge 12 bucks for it im not cheap Im just letting you know if you Dont feel like getting ripped off don't order any drinks from there they're very stingy with it hopefully who ever runs that place steps there game up
84,Bambara,5 star rating,12/17/2016,"I feel like more people need to know about Bambara now that Chef Baz has taken over. Favorite chef in SF and now favorite chef in MA!!! We are lucky to have him back east cuz he was killing it on the west and we were missing out here. Charcuterie  mussels, fluke crudo...... Can't wait to be regular. If he ever puts the lamb buns back on the menu get them in bulk"
85,Bambara,5 star rating,12/25/2018,"We held a post-wedding lunchtime reception here in November for about 30 people, and the event turned out great. Management was responsive answering all our questions and accommodating our requests leading up to the event, and everything went well the day of; the staff were all very friendly and on top of everything, and the food was delicious. The price was also reasonable for this type of event. Overall I am extremely pleased with how things turned out and I appreciate the staff at Bambara for making it happen."
86,Bambara,5 star rating,11/3/2014,"Amazing house cocktails! There are so many to choose from and you literally cannot go wrong with any -- something for everyone. I personally loved the Bambara Buck (scotch, ginger beer, lemon) and the Midnight Smash (cognac, mint, blackberries, lemon) to name a few. Also had dessert at the bar -- warm caramel date cake LITERALLY DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN. I could have that everyday of my life and die happy. Exceptional service, bartender was very personable and attentive. Made it a fun experience! Great place to go for a night out. Cannot wait to go back."
87,Bambara,5 star rating,6/21/2016,Brunch was delicious! We decided to go with a couple of our friends after my wedding and we couldn't have asked for great food choices! I would recommend this place!
88,Bambara,2 star rating,9/3/2017,"On a rainy day we found ourselves here as we were staying at the hotel.

The service was great, which is what earned any stars at all.  The food was truly bad.

My apple ginger cider tasted like soap.  I love ginger (and cider), but this was the yuckiest cider I've tasted.  It was undrinkable. At $10, I'd expect it to be at least adequate if not good.

The menu was small and quite limited.  We were hoping for seafood, but as it was brunch most options involved eggs or bread.  Because of my gluten sensitivity, my options were extremely limited, although thankfully they did have gluten free bread.  I opted for the gluten free grilled cheese and tomato soup - I wanted something more local but few options provided that, and none I could eat with my allergy. My husband opted for the lobster pasta.  He thought it was adequate but underwhelming.  Not anything special.  

My grilled cheese has good flavor but was small and had a tiny amount of cheese in it.  I make much better ones at home, and I'm no chef.  The tomato soup was truly bad.  It tasted like watered down marinara sauce lacking even that flavor. Mostly tomato paste.  So bad.  I left hungry."
89,Bambara,5 star rating,12/15/2018,"I really like this restaurant! Great atmosphere, comfortable seating, excellent cocktails and food. Wild mushroom soup was on the menu and it is among the BEST I've eaten and mushroom soup is my all time favorite. Everything was top notch."

Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to exceptional Italian Cuisine! If your looking for a great place to eat in the North End, Terramia Ristorante is your place! Our waitress Jenna & the oh so talented chef, made our meal beyond perfect. I can not brag enough about the food! We ordered The Raviolone Aperto - Giant Faced Ravioli, Spaghetti alla Carbonara, and Costata di Vitelli - Grilled 13oz Veal Chop & was served a the perfect Chiant Classico. Thank You again Terramia!"
2,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"UNDER COVER VEGAN HOT SPOT!!!

My (non-vegan) boyfriend and I just left dinner here, and we could not have loved this place more! They had so many versatile dishes that catered to every diet. Not only did they offer vegan dishes, but it's clear they treat them with the same thought and consideration they do their non-vegan meals. The vegan meatballs/polenta appetizer was so good that my boyfriend didn't believe it was vegan!  They provide such a warm, intimate vibe and we felt right at home. The wine was delicious, and the service was incredible. This will definitely be our new go-to spot in the city."
3,Terramia Ristorante,3 star rating,3/18/2022,"Visiting Boston and found this cute Italian restaurant to eat at! You definitely need reservations to eat here- I'd recommend making reservations a few days in advance to ensure you can get a table. The restaurant itself is small, but it's a very nice environment nonetheless. 

We decided on a bottle of their Pinot Grigio and it was delicious! For my entree, I got the Ravioli alla Amatriciana. I enjoyed the flavorful red sauce on top and it was complimented with some roasted cherry tomatoes. The meal overall was okay. It was a very small portion of food and had a weird after taste in the raviolis with the smoked pancetta. I definitely expected the food to be amazing for how expensive it was. A friend of mine got the Risotto- it was an decent dish, but had so much truffle oil in it that it was overwhelming. The tomato soup was really really good though and we loved the smiley face the cook put on it for us!

I loved being seated in front of the huge window in the front of the restaurant- it was a great view of the city in front of us! I really appreciated the vegan options they offer here for my friends and it was overall a pleasant experience. The staff was very kind and I enjoyed my time here!"
4,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,10/10/2021,"I made reservations in July 2021 and I called 9/2/2021to make sure they had them.
  I went to the restaurant on October 9 at 6:15 pm. She had no reservation for us under my name. I had printed out the paperwork for the restaurant and showed her the paper and as well as when I had called to confirm the dinner reservation. She had a 2 top and sat us.   
The waitress was very good, she answered all our questions , I felt somewhat rushed and the food was delicious.  The room is very small and noisy you could hardly hear yourself talk ,there is outside seating as well.  They do not have coffee.
The bread pudding is fabulous large enough to share.  I had a veal chop and it was cooked to my liking , i did not like the risotto.
My husband had salmon with crab topping he said it was delicious."
5,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,10/10/2021,"I really enjoyed my dinner with family at Terramia. We had been in the area and got done our touristy tour a little early. Although we had a reservation for 8pm we stopped by to see if they could let us in and they did. 

The bread and bean spread you get kicked us off to a great start, we ordered a bottle of Oregon red and shared some arachini which was fantastic. Most people at the table ordered the open faced seafood ravioli, I wish I got a picture because it was beautiful! Creamy but not too heavy. I ordered the mushroom gnocchi!"
6,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,3/2/2022,"Per usual, absolutely excellent. Great atmosphere, great food! Been coming here for years and it's yet to loose its charm!"
7,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,7/13/2021,"I have had the pleasure of trying a few Italian places here in the north end. A couple friend of ours swore by this place and took us here. Boy were they right! Best Italian in all of boston.
The sangria paired wonderfully, and the pasta was homemade and lively. Beautifully creamy sauce and just all around lovely flavoursome. It was cheesy and the texture was just right to sit on the tongue.

Since my first visit I've returned again trying the salmon. Cooked beautifully, interesting and wonderfully paired flavours, all with a filling sized portion. This place truly delivers!"
8,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,3/19/2022,Gnocchi was pillowy and soft. The steak had great sauce with delicious sides of sweet potatoes and spinach. Very large portions and white tablecloth atmosphere
9,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,9/20/2021,"To all the vegans who just struggle with finding food in the North End, Terramia Ristorante has you covered! They have an expansive vegan menu which includes vegan ravioli, vegan spaghetti with meatballs, vegan risotto, and vegan ice cream to wrap up the night! 

This spot is just so cozy, and we got a table with the window view which just made it extra special! Its a great option for a dinner out!"
10,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,8/4/2021,"So glad that we decided to make a reservation and come back to Terramia. We got the Gnocchi Ai Funghi and the (vegan) Spaghetti Con Polpette. My boyfriend raved about the gnocchi and said that it was the best that he has ever had. My spaghetti was delicious, and honestly if I hadn't known that it was vegan before ordering it, I would never have known. The ""meat""balls were perfect consistency and flavor.

We sat in their outdoor seating area across the street and it was great. They have some planters with pretty tropical plants blocking you from the road so it creates a nice atmosphere. The street is busy and a little loud but that added to the experience in my opinion. The service was fast and great.

I specifically want to thank Julie for her help and hospitality. She recommended that we make a reservation and come back and she was there to seat us when we did. I would absolutely go back to visit."
11,Terramia Ristorante,3 star rating,3/21/2021,"Highlights: Arancini, bolognese, homemade pasta, bread pudding 

Downside: Service

I was super excited to try this place based on reviews so we came for Boston restaurant week. We had a reservation at 7:15 but were told to wait outside in the cold for 10 minutes as a table was not ready yet...30 minutes later, we were finally seated and allowed into the restaurant (with no apologies from the hostess might I add). The restaurant itself is very small with only a couple tables so perhaps they overbooked for the night. Many parties were also forced to wait for more than 30 minutes in the cold past their reservation time and many decided to leave due to this (we were determined to eat though!). After being seated and placing our orders, it took 45 minutes to actually receive any food. At this point, we were pretty dang hungry and while a waiter did provide us with 4 slices of bread, water, and our drinks, they never came back to check on us or refill our bread or water. 

Once we finally received our appetizers my choice was pretty disappointing. The caprese was small and quite bland (however at least the mozzarella was good). My partner got the arancini which was the far superior option. It was very flavorful and served with a nice and creamy tomato sauce. It took again quite a bit of time to receive our next course which was the pasta dish. I got the bolognese which was amazing and my partner got the spaghetti and meat balls which was okay (sauce not super flavorful, meatball texture was a bit off). It's great the pasta is homemade and well cooked though! Our third course and dessert were pretty good and came in a more timely fashion compared to the other courses. I was a big fan of the bread pudding which we thoroughly enjoyed and wiped out despite being full. 

Overall, I think this restaurant has pretty good food (if you order the right dishes) however, if it was not restaurant week, I'm not sure I'd come back due to the price vs. flavor and quality. Additionally, service left much to be desired. Waiters did not really check on us and we were offered no apology for the late start to the meal nor the duration of time it took to receive food.

It seems as though in addition to overbooking people, the kitchen was incredibly slow and backed up. Perhaps if you want to come here it's best to come on a slow day or an off hour or get take out."
12,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,6/24/2021,"Traditional Italian deliciousness! You could tell everything was made with love. We started with the antipasto plate, Mista and arugula salad- all so good and great portion size. For entrees we had the bolognese, eggplant, chicken Marsala - so yummy!"
13,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,6/30/2021,"Terramia was wonderful! They have adorable outdoor seating with cute umbrellas and globe lights which makes for a great atmosphere. 

The food was delicious! We ordered the Involtini di Melanzane, Arancini, and a half dozen oysters. Highly recommend the Arancini! They also serve bread with a bean dip and coming from someone who usually doesn't like beans... the dip was amazing! 

Overall, highly recommend trying this place out! Great food with an even better atmosphere- be sure to snag a table outdoors!"
14,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,7/25/2021,"Out of all the restaurants to choose from in Little Italy, I chose this one because of the vegan options. I don't usually like to eat Italian food out for that reason. I was very pleased with all the food here, from the complementary bread and dip to the entree I chose. I decided on the vegan ravioli and it was very good. My mom went with the Salmon and was informed that the mashed potatoes did have diary but she could have subbed them for potato wedges if needed. My husband chose the spaghetti with the eggplant based meatball option and let me try some of his. I couldn't even tell it was eggplant but it was fantastic. It's quite pricy here but the food is good and it's in a quaint little restaurant with indoor dining only. That was okay thought because we did make a reservation for our larger party of 6 (with one baby). Our waitress was so patient with us and was very friendly. Overall great experience and I would highly recommend."
15,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,7/20/2021,"I came here with my boyfriend for his birthday and his first time visiting Boston. We sat inside and it was small but cozy with wonderful ambiance. A lot of the restaurants in the North End are so dimly lit that you can't even read the menu. But Terramia has the perfect amount of light for reading without losing the romantic feel. 
WOW. I am vegan, but my boyfriend is not. If you're vegan, you probably already know how hard it is to find good vegan Italian food. You WILL find it here. I was so delighted. I ordered the vegan ravioli and I wish I had ordered a 2nd one to go. It was so flavorful and filling. They also have a gnocchi dish that can be made vegan as well, which our server, Jenna, recommended. But I heard so many wonderful things about the ravioli, I had to try it. 
One of the most important details regarding this restaurant is the service. I have not experienced such enthusiastic and helpful service like I did here. Jenna was AWESOME. She helped recommend and explain certain wines and was able to answer any questions we had. She also helped me discretely put in an order for a birthday bread pudding for my boyfriend (which was the best bread pudding he ever had). She also got me a vegan gelato without me even asking. Honestly, just the most thoughtful and helpful waitress I've ever had.
The white bean dip and bread was so amazing we ordered more to take home with us!!
My boyfriend also had the lobster fritters and was very, very impressed. He also ordered the open faced ravioli which he LOVED. This place is great because of all of the different dishes. There's hundreds of restaurants in the North End that serve spaghetti and meatballs, Alfredo, etc. But Terramia has some really delicious and interesting dishes to try. 
It was absolutely the best birthday dinner I could have imagined for my boyfriends birthday. I will definitely be coming back!!"
16,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,2/25/2022,"Short review but right to the point. Someone referred me, you have to make reservations air don't bother going, small only 10-12 tables, and service and food were FANTASTIC!!! Do yourself a favor and go!!!!!"
17,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,3/29/2021,"Went with my girl on a Friday night for Dine Out Boston. Easily made a reservation through Yelp. They were pretty steady, it was 6:45p, didn't look like many were in the restaurant that didn't make a reservation. But we were let in pretty quickly at our time.

Friendly staff, fantastic ambience.

Dine Out Boston Menu.

Polpete was fantastic. Their sauce is rich but not thick. Their great sauce will come up again. Meatball was not too overwhelming, though could've been eased by being cut with more breadcrumbs etc. but still great

Arancini was something great. I love Arancini 

Pappardelle with Bolognese was my favorite. Lovely homemade noodles. Bolognese was not the best I've ever had, but in no means was it not fantastic 

The chicken Marsala was a surprise. A lot chicken options in Italian restaurants are just menu fillers, but it was great. Not dry like a lot of chicken dishes go!

I would go back even if it was not restaurant week"

19,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,2/7/2022,"my family loves this place! love that their menu has vegan and gluten free options as well. came here with my aunt and uncle - tried the aperol spritz which was tasty. i got the vegan risotto - i thought it came vegan (it does not) but once I realized my mistake, the waiter took it back and had the kitchen make a new one for me. will definitely be back!"
20,Terramia Ristorante,3 star rating,8/11/2021,"After a few days of walking around and getting to know Boston Downtown area, we went to Little Italy. I just wanted a nice vegan meal, as the only vegan in the family and usually in the group, I usually have to settle for whatever I can get when traveling. This restaurant had mixed reviews but we had just gotten off a long day of touring and so it was my turn to choose. The bread and white bean dip are vegan and I was absolutely delighted because it was so fresh and yummy. I also ordered the vegan meatballs and the vegano ravioli. The food was okay, not great and nothing exciting about it. I was hungry and appreciated of the veggies served with the ravioli but I agree with others that have said there is a lack of flavor to it and somewhat bland. However, the service was great, the food that everyone else ordered seemed to be really good and they were all happy with it. It's just the vegan food that is ok."
21,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,1/6/2021,Very good Italian dinner here the other night. The other day we decided we needed 24 oysters for buck a shuck. This was wrong. We did not need 24 oysters. They were huge. They were interesting- not the best oysters I've ever had. My boyfriend got the Bolognese and I got the carbonara. A very different dish for each of us. It was yummy and the kitchen was quick because it was a slow Wednesday. Overall a good meal.
22,Terramia Ristorante,2 star rating,1/1/2022,"Wanted to write a review for any vegans looking at this place. It's a beautiful little place with a great cozy ambience, but we were really disappointed in their vegan options. The only decent enough item was the gnocchi. I think for the price you pay, overall it's not worth it for vegans."
23,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,8/30/2021,"So we are in Boston to drop off our oldest son, who is traveling to Italy for school and had a reservation here. Traffic was terrible so we were going to be late, but I called abd they were so gracious and saved our reservation until we got there. It was Italian American festival so there were thousands of people out, no parking and chaos. But this place is worth all that. One of the Italian Vegan restaurants let alone a Bisteca that was one of the best I've ever had."
24,Terramia Ristorante,2 star rating,7/18/2021,"We were excited as they had quite a few vegetarian/vegan friendly options. We tried the spaghetti and meatballs and risotto. Both entrées were fairly pricey however the portions were quite small. Additionally, the food was very bland. The service was good, hence the two stars. 

We really wanted to like this restaurant a lot. That said, with so many fantastic restaurants in the neighborhood, we probably will not be back here anytime soon. Most of the restaurants around are happy to whip up vegan/vegetarian options for party members that are so inclined."
25,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,7/12/2021,"The service was attentive and the restaurant was very clean and organized. The Spaghetti Carbonara was pretty blend...it was very disappointing.

For wine, we ordered a bottle of Nebbiolo. It was sour and sweet, a perfect combination for this savory dish. 

Personnel is very personable and attentive. They were able to add candles to my friend's dessert for a nice little birthday surprise."

28,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,3/7/2020,"I walk in and an older gentleman asks me, are you from Jersey? I served in WWII with a guy with the same last name. Nope, my family settled in Brooklyn. Now show me those meatballs!

It's the first time my wife is dining in the North end, waiting outside for these Italian spots isn't something she's ready to experience. My sons girlfriend is Vegan so my mission was to:

1- obtain a reservation
2- Vegan options 
(I always get confused, what the heck is the difference between Vegan and Vegetarian? We didn't have these issues in the 70s..)

Terramia Ristorante has a nice menu I was able to make a reservation for 4 with no issues.

We're seated in a very small dining establishment. The layout squeezes every table for maximum seating. I'm seeing the wait staff hustle around tables and getting the dishes to the patrons. Our waiter comes over and reads the specials to us. I'm in the mood for some freshly shucked Oysters. Fish is what I wish for dining this evening. But first! I wanna try their meatballs. Man oh man, these meatballs are fire! The sauce is fresh and gave the Terramia meatballs an added depth. There's no fillers in their meatballs, it tastes like mamma Terramia is in the back rolling these bad boys.

My Oysters? Fresh and a New England treat. If I lived here, I'd have Oysters for breakfast, it's such a guilty pleasure.

The same with the dinner special I ordered, Swordfish Puttanesca style. The swordfish wasn't tough, it was cooked perfectly. I also enjoyed the little kick, I didn't see any Anchovies? I did enjoy the capers, this is a must order dish if it comes up for a special.

No dessert, the kids wanted to take us for cannoli. (And wait on line..)

Terramia Ristorante, we enjoyed dining at your establishment."

We were happy to be able to get a reservation relatively soon from when we checked, and we were lucky as we saw that had the only table open waiting for us when we got there.

31,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,6/11/2021,"Came here last minute with a group of 6. The service was good- i think maybe they were a bit understaffed.

34,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,10/27/2019,"After wandering around the North End shopping and sightseeing you get hungry.  Checked out a few places and being turned away due to no reservations available I found this place.  Got a reservation about a hour away so by time we made our way towards the restaurant it was time to eat.  

Located on the quieter end of the district is a small quaint restaurant.  Inside is nice and cozy, well lit for a nice dinner.  Immediate service as we sat down so that was a plus as we were hungry.  Few minutes later our order is put in and our wine arrived.  

Five minutes later, our dinner is here. I was surprised and happy for the fast service.  

*Bottle of Cabernet
*Arrancini Rice Balls - Two generous sized portions of flavors and a nice crisp when cut into.  

*Vegan Risotto - Perfectly cooked rice with asparagus and porcini mushrooms. 

*Halibut - Baked with a nice crispy top served with two piece of shrimp and with sides of fresh spinach and a mound of creamy mashed potatoes. 

*Pasta Special - pomodoro style, plain but so delicious 

*Vegan Ravioli - the highlight of the night just as others have raved in the reviews of yelp.  Sorry I can't remember what the fillings was.  

I would've gave 5 stars because. Everything was wonderful and exceptional.  Minus one star for our wine not being topped off.  

Definitely a place to eat if you're in the area."
35,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,1/1/2022,"Best Italian food with cozy, upscale ambiance and Italian flare. They have good selection of traditional Italian dishes and vegan choices that fits everyone's needs. We had a group of selective individuals and everyone loved the preparations. We had trouble finding parking which is not unusual for that location, they still were very polite, courteous and tried giving us directions to near by garages. That just made our evening extra special.  They even accommodated our request for serving warm/hot water for one of our members (remember I mentioned selective!) Vs usually cold or tap water. Best place in town!! We will be back to try this again!"
36,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,12/22/2021,Intimate setting.  Well presented dishes that synced with the menu. Wait staff knowledgeable and attentive.  I will definitely dine here again in the near future .
37,Terramia Ristorante,2 star rating,11/27/2021,"Food was meh. Bread WAS COLD. Bizarre-- never had cold bread before. They also apparently didn't have hot water. It was such a cold night and they REFUSED to heat up water. All the other restaurants had a long wait time, but we were hungry so opted for this empty restaurant. Go where the people go. Stay away from this restaurant. Bland food. Portions are not generous, and waitress took her time cleaning all the tables before serving us water."
38,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,8/18/2021,Their lobster starter and veal is amazing. Not as crowded and loud as other places in the North End
39,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,7/31/2021,"Really excellent service. Lovely outdoor seating area (with a seemingly neverending stream of beautiful women in sundresses walking by for some reason. It was a beautiful day). As many have noted, plenty of vegan options, and the waitstaff is well informed about what's vegan and how menu items are veganized.

I think the food itself may be hit or miss; not that anything is terrible, just some things may be underwhelming in flavor. I admit I have some buyer's remorse about choosing the mushroom gnocchi, I was debating between that and the ravioli. The gnocchi itself was good but the sauce was very plain--it was okay. The complimentary white bean dip was delicious, and my husband enjoyed his spinach and feta ravioli and caprese salad. I would say that the food could do with a little less oil, but it is Italian food. I would also say it's a little on the pricey side, but it's actually well in line with other North End restaurants."
40,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,8/14/2021,"Went last night for the first time and had an amazing experience! The service was excellent-- they truly went above and beyond, the food was delicious, and great ambiance. We loved the arancini appetizer and both of our meals were cooked perfectly. I will definitely be back."
41,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,11/26/2021,This place was so warm and inviting and intimate. The staff was attentive and informed. The food was AMAZING. Especially the Ravioli Amatriciana. Highly recommend
42,Terramia Ristorante,3 star rating,8/25/2019,"I was not very impressed with this place overall. The food was decent but overpriced. The Capesante scallop dish tasted good but the scallops in it were slightly overcooked. I also ordered the Ravioli alla Amatriciana for myself but was more blown away by partner's order of the Raviolone Aperto. The pasta in both were good, but outside of the sauce there wasn't much else that stood out to me when it came to the Ravioli alla Amatriciana. The Raviolone Aperto on the other hand, was pretty creamy and the seafood at the bottom of the open ravioli was very delicious. I would order that in a heartbeat if I ever came back. 

What dinged my rating of this place the most was the service. I didn't think the staff were very attentive to us while we were there. We barely were checked on and our server didn't stick around to allow us to ask questions. It was pretty crazy in the North End in general with a festival happening outside, but the restaurant itself is pretty small so there aren't a ton of people to tend to, to begin with. Outside of taking our order and the check I barely interacted with my waiter and when I did his focus seemed to be elsewhere. 

As mentioned before, this place is on the smaller side so I'd suggest trying to get a seat closer to a wall rather than in the middle section. We sat in the middle and got bumped by people a few times due to the smaller space. 

This is a decent date night spot but not very quiet. Depending on the type of occasion, you may want to look for something were you would have more privacy and hear less of the outside noise."
43,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,11/22/2020,"Overall I was really happy with my experience at Terramia but I took a star off because the meatballs were not very good. They were really hard to cut and the texture was kind of odd, but the sauce was at least good. For my meal I got penne with pomodoro and loved it, the sauce was delicious! I also like that they have organic wines."
44,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,3/5/2020,"This was just an outstanding meal during dine out week. Both food and service were exceptional. The inside of the restaurant is small but lovely. Definitely make a reservation. The place was near empty when I got there and full when I left. To start, rustic bread with a cannellini bean spread and olive oil was brought to my table. This in itself was 5 stars. As part of dine out week, I ordered the caprese salad, pappardelle bolognese and chicken Marsala. Everything was delicious. I'll be dreaming of the pappardelle until I return. And the chicken Marsala was exquisite with the chicken cooked on the bone and served over fresh spinach and crisp potatoes. I cannot wait to go back. And I think I'll stay for dessert next time. Can't forget to mention the excellent service by Gabrielle and staff!!!"
45,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,4/4/2021,Came here for Easter with my family! The vegan ravioli was terrific fully recommend! Vegan Ravioli
46,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,3/1/2019,"I had a friend visiting from out of town who wanted to try dollar oysters in the area, and we came here since we were close to the North End during the hours that they had this deal. This is a pretty small space (and it feels quite fancy) but we came early enough that we didn't have to wait for a table. 

We had the oysters and the antipasto tradizionale plate (we were going elsewhere for full dinner). Neither of us are oyster connoisseurs, but they tasted great and were fresh and juicy, especially with a dash of the hot sauce they included (in the form of ridiculously cute mini bottles). The antipasto was also good, very flavorful with good variety. 

The slightly more elegant feel of the environment was something we didn't expect but it was definitely a plus. We were pretty satisfied with this choice!"
47,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,10/28/2020,"We had the vegan meatballs and mushroom gnochi. Both were very good. Our server was kind, attentive, and efficient. Great service and a cozy atmosphere. 

Make sure to specificity that you want vegan alternatives to the options offered! Online menu is a bit confusing."
48,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,10/20/2021,Fantastic food as always.  Love this place.  I had the seafood ravioli and my wife had the bolognaise.... Yummy!!
49,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,9/4/2019,"The food was great, I put on my reservation 
"" pretend im famous I'm going on a date"" 

And the older guy sammi played along and introduced me to the entire staff literally hilarious. 50% tip And 5 star review is the least I could do"
50,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,4/18/2021,"Me and my boyfriend were in Boston for a few days, some friends recommended this restaurant and it was THE BEST we had while at Boston. Pasta was delicious, their bread is amazing and the ambiance was !!!"
51,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,9/9/2021,"Great bread, salad, and pasta. The bean dip that came with the bread was interesting, but surprisingly good. My wife and I shared a refreshing peppery arugula and fennel salad. I then had the ravioli, and it was great to have after not having ravioli for a long time (2+ years since not being vegan). I'm very glad we were able to eat in the Italian food area of Boston, and it was an excellent experience overall, for a vegan especially."
52,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,9/9/2021,Vegan forward and delicious! We had the complimentary bread and bean dip (vegan) which was a fresh taste on the classic appetizer. The salad was a perfect addition to our meal. Best pasta I've ever had! Would recommend to all!
53,Terramia Ristorante,1 star rating,7/5/2021,"Tried this place because of all the great vegan reviews. Massive disappointment - the ravioli was undercooked and covered by what tasted like store bought pasta sauce, the ""risotto"" was completely flavorless boiled rice; all this at ~20-25$/plate."
54,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,8/1/2021,Group of 7 of us came here and we were all blown away. Everything was delicious. This was our favorite meal in Boston. Best Bolognese we've ever had! Be sure to get a reservation as this is a smaller restaurant. We will definitely be back!
55,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,8/22/2021,"My boyfriend and I love Terramia! There aren't a ton of vegan places in the north end, so finding a place with vegan options was great. We both love the vegan gnocchi, as well as the bean dip they give you before your entree. Staff has always been very friendly and helpful!"
56,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,8/20/2021,"I ate here with a party of 9 and it was SO GOOD!!! They were very accommodating for my large party, especially since I made a reservation a few days before. The food and wine was delicious and they had lots of vegan options too! I will definitely be coming back in the near future. :)"
57,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,4/29/2019,"Perfect date spot for a a non vegan and a vegan! So intimate and cozy inside. It kept giving us vibes from our Greece trip! 
I would highly recommend making a reservation, it is super small inside and even with a reservation we had to wait a few minutes until a table left. 
To start they brought us fresh (vegan friendly) bread with a smashed cannellini  bean + olive oil dip. It was soooo tasty! You will want to eat it all, but don't spoil your dinner! 
My husband had their meatball appetizer, he loved them! It would be great to share for the table as well. 
For dinner, I had the vegan ravioli - yes!!!! Nothing better than some pasta packed with veggies! It was delicious and the perfect amount for a dinner serving. 
My husband had the crab stuffed salmon. Of course this was also amazing. 

I was super excited to try their vegan gelato, but tonight they only had a vegan sorbet. We decided to pass on dessert. I did see some coming out and it of course also looked amazing!"
58,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,3/11/2020,"I have been meaning to write this review for my Valentine's Day date at Terramia Ristorante. It is expected that Valentine's Day is a hectic night for the restaurant industry. We arrived about five minutes before our reservation and had to wait over 40 minutes for our table. It was freezing outside and we were huddled up next to another couple in the doorway. One thing that was upsetting was the fact that a few pairs of people were seated at a table for four with two empty seats each. I wish management appropriately planned the seating arrangements to accommodate for the number of reservations. My boyfriend and I did appreciate the two free glasses of red wine after a colleague complained about the long wait. Although the long wait was an annoyance, it was a well-prepared delectable meal with great presentation and an interesting flavor I've never experienced before. The lobster ravioli was one of the most luscious dishes I have ever experienced. I would certainly eat it again."
59,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,7/10/2021,Really interesting and yummy food. Super healthy and friendly folks.  Liked the tables full of spices for decor.
60,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,3/11/2019,"another great experience! We love the corner table in the bay window, it's so cozy and has a great view. My mom and I both had the pappardelle Bolognese, which was delicious. My sister had the vegan ravioli and my dad had the fish special, and asked for a side of pasta with dairy-free Bolognese sauce so my sister could share it. We were very impressed and happy with the food, service, and ambiance! (visited 2/20/19)"
61,Terramia Ristorante,1 star rating,5/22/2021,"I had a really unfortunate evening at Terramia last night. I come to Boston every three months for my moms doctors appointments and have been here a few times and usually love it because they offer a vegan menu. Unfortunately, pork ended up in my dish and I didn't realize it until it was in my mouth. When looking back at my picture that I took prior to eating, I could see the pork, which is in the picture. It looks very similar to the mushrooms in the dish. My mom ordered the steak medium rare, the first time it came back VERY rare. She sent it back, and the second time it came back well done (see pic). We didn't send it back the second time, and just let the waiter know about the pork and the overcooked steak. The waiter was very nice but we didn't get an apology. They sent us free limoncellos and a free dessert but I'd rather have been given the option to comp the food. I LOVE Sonny the older gentleman who is there, but I'm inclined to not come back after last night. I wouldn't have left this review if they fixed it while we were there but I felt that I had to leave this review as well as edit my review on HappyCow the vegan site."
62,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,8/9/2017,"Mama mia I actually found a solid vegan Italian option in a non-vegan restaurant... in Boston of all places. 

This town isn't exactly veg friendly, so I was shocked to find that a yelp search of vegan options brought me to a small Italian restaurant in the North End with *gasp* more than one vegan entreé! 

The restaurant is small and dim (hence the bad pics) but perfect for an intimate, relaxed meal. We thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Had the marinated organic olives to start and some Italian beer. The main attraction for me, of course, was the vegan ravioli that everyone raves about and what led me here. They didn't disappoint at all, and I loved that they had more of an emphasis on fresh veggies over being stuffed with vegan cheese. The red sauce was also well balanced an enjoyable. 

Service was friendly and knowledgeable. The only thing missing is a vegan dessert option."
63,Terramia Ristorante,1 star rating,7/5/2021,"Heard a lot about this place since it's one of the only restaurants in the north end with vegan options. This was some of the most bland food I've eaten. Our pasta even came out undercooked. When we sent it back, the waiter just got the same one out without any changes just more sauce. We ordered the mushroom risotto and vegano ravioli. Maybe the non vegan options are better!"
64,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,8/1/2019,"Wow. What a place. From the first bite, I knew I had found the best Italian (In America?) 
Ordered their tomato garlic mozzarella soup to start, along with the lobster ravioli. Was not disappointed.

Eat here."
65,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,10/4/2018,"Terramia Ristorante is THE perfect date night spot. Located in the heart of ""Little Italy"" in the North End, Terramia Ristorante offers up authentic Italian food. They even have vegan options!!! That's what sold me on coming here. 

My husband and I started off with a bowl of tomato soup. This paired perfectly with the complimentary fresh bread that accompanied the meal. And get this - the bread came with a side of white bean hummus! For my main I went with the vegan ravioli, which was also fantastic. Topping my meal with a glass of red wine made the evening extra special. 

Terramia Ristorante is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Boston. It's so rare to find vegan Italian food anywhere. I'll continue to get my Italian fix here. 

PRO TIP: Make reservations.

66,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,1/8/2019,Visited here back in October with a group of 7. It is tight quarters and we were lucky to get a reservation during HOC weekend. We went because the menu was good for all of our groups tastes. We had two vegans with us and the food was top notch. Service was great as well!
67,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,11/14/2020,"Excellent experience here, considering the covid situation. Awesome service and awesome food!"
68,Terramia Ristorante,3 star rating,10/21/2020,Oysters are delicious. Great view by the window. Ravioli was average. Service was so so. Happy to see diverse clientele.
69,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,3/6/2020,"Went for the pure reason that they have vegan options - the vegan ravioli and the vegan ice cream - both were delicious. 

In addition, the group had the mozzarella and the 'regular' ravioli as well the scallop appetiser and another pasta dish, which escapes me now. All were very good - very rich.

Is it worth the money - ehhh, not sure but I would go back for the vegan dishes alone."
70,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,4/19/2020,"We had such an amazing, romantic vegan dinner here! We visited Boston back in December, when their Christmas decorations lit up the intimate space. My husband and I loved the spaghetti ""meat""ball, the chianti wine, bread and salad. The experience was wonderful and brought us memories of our honeymoon in Italy!"
71,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,10/10/2020,Holy shit as a North Jersey Italian I'm usually not a big fan of eating in Italian restaurants.  Bid this place is effing amazing.  I highly recommend this place.  Our server Andy was excellent too.
72,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,5/25/2021,"Good food done well. Quiet the night we went, but nice atmosphere. It was chilly, but recommend sitting outside. Staff was attentive. I was hoping for a bigger wine list but the Planetos was good. Osso Bucco was tender but could use more flavor. Lobster ravioli was delicious."
73,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,4/29/2021,Amazing vegan options. Atmosphere is romantic & wholesome. The staff is extremely nice. Can't wait to go back.
74,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,11/5/2019,"So I definitely enjoyed this restaurant...there were multiple vegan options, which can be difficult to find at an Italian restaurant. 

Firstly, we had a reservation so getting a table was not a problem.  We were immediately greeted and seated. The place is small, quaint and romantic. 

I had a glass of the Stemmari Pinot noir from Sicily and my boyfriend had a glass of the Bonterra merlot from California. 

My boyfriend had the tomato soup of the day and the spaghetti carbonara, both of which he loved. 

I had the vegan ravioli and it was delicious. 

All in all, we would definitely go back to this place."
75,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,12/27/2019,"My family has been coming here the day after Christmas for about 10 years. It's a small space and they are always highly accommodating. 

In my experience, the waitstaff has always been friendly and available. 

We order family style so I've tried just about everything on the menu and have no complaints. On our most recent visit, I was a fan of the ravioli - the lobster fritter is also excellent as are their meatballs. Make sure you save room for the flourless chocolate cake!"
76,Terramia Ristorante,3 star rating,11/8/2019,"I wanted to like this place. It's a quaint Italian restaurant in the North End. Warning...they don't really have space to wait inside if you're waiting for a table so bundle up if you're waiting in the winter! We had a reservation, but they weren't ready for us. We had to wait an extra 20 minutes to be seated. Then a waiter introduced himself, gave us the specials, and then promised to return. He never did. We had to flag down another waiter and then proceeded to give us the specials again. The chickpeas dip they gave us with the bread was good. I got the lobster ravioli, and it was delicious. The downside was that they got some shell in the ravioli so I had to pick it out as I was eating. Someone at my table got the swordfish special and another got the bolognese. They were both bland."
77,Terramia Ristorante,4 star rating,11/25/2019,"Terramia is very small but the service was excellent. It also seemed to be a family owned business for generations. They also appeared to have invested in a point of sales system that revolves around an iPad. As for the food, the food was great. At the time, they had a lobster ravioli special that was fantastic. I also felt that the prices were fair for a reasonable portion of food. 

P.S - they have great wine!!"
78,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,1/6/2020,"What an outstanding restaurant. My wife looked this up before traveling to Boston for a weekend, and was blown away by their vegan options. I cannot recall ever having a better vegan meal in a restaurant, I wish I could eat the mushroom meatballs every single day of my life. Even small things like the bread and vegan dipping sauce were some of the highest level food we've ever had. Cannot wait to come back!"
79,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,10/4/2019,"Holy moly! This place is the cutest, coziest place with such a warm ambiance and delectable dining! The host was an incredibly cute older gentleman who guided us to our seat. Our waiter was also very helpful and guided us with our ""off the menu"" order. We shared a bottle of Napa wine, but they have an ample list from Italy as well. To start, we shared bread and the special white bean and olive oil sauce and we had the stuffed squash blossoms which were drizzled in an incredible honey-garlic aioli. My friend had the ""special"" lobster ravioli in lobster sauce, i had the mushroom truffle risotto and both were so delicious! We absolutely loved the food and loved the service even more! For dessert we splurged on the caramel bread pudding and went home with plenty of leftovers. This is a great place for a date, a group dinner or even a treat to yourself! Thank you for the delicious meal."
80,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,11/29/2019,"This place is easy to get a reservation for on a weekday for a larger party of 6 (for a North End restaurant, 3 people is a crowd so this is awesome). The soup and appetizers are all amazing. And I mean all, Im not just too lazy to list them. The second time I came here I was not very fond of the oysters we received unfortunately, however the lobster Ravioli that were on special more than made up for it. This is constantly good Italian food with a great wine list."
81,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,5/5/2018,"This was my first time trying Italian food in Boston and wow was I AMAZED! I called on a Friday evening to ask if they had any open tables and they said that they will have one ready for me when I got there. As soon as I walked up with my party of 3, the owner said, ""you are the one who called! Come on in, we have a table ready for you!"" He put our table RIGHT by the window!! On top of that, the food was wonderful. I ordered the vegan ravioli and was amazed. The flavor was fantastic! The bread was also great and they give you an Italian dipping sauce as well, that tastes like hummus with olive oil! Come here if you want FRESH, homemade and DELICIOUS Italian food!!"
82,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,2/14/2020,"One of the best North End Gems to choose from in this neighborhood of good Italian Restaurants. The traditional antipasto is stunning and a must have. It is customized to the size of your party and my daughter and I left nothing to take home. 
Our second course was a home made pappardelle bolognese. I cleaned my plate. The combination of meats in the sauce with just the right amount of cheese and perfectly cooked pasta, made this dish a must have. 
My daughter has food sensitivities our servers accommodated all our requests going out of their way to ensure our needs were met. 
Service was on point. As soon as my wine glass we getting low, I was asked if I would like another glass of wine.  
The melt in your mouth bone in Oso Bucco was our main course and did not disappoint. 
Be sure to get a reservation because it fills up fast."
83,Terramia Ristorante,3 star rating,4/2/2018,"My friends and I came here for dinner during Dine Out Boston! When you first enter the restaurant, you're greeted with dim lighting and two fantastic window seats, complete with dazzling strings of lights draped all around! Though we couldn't sit there since it was already occupied, we had a candle-lit dinner, which was nice! 

The bread starter was delicious. The bread was soft and fresh and not incredibly hard like how some places serve it. Be sure to save some bread to dip in your pasta sauces... :- ) We had a few options to choose from on the Dine Out Boston-specific menu, including some vegetarian dishes! 

I had the arancini to start. It was a sizeable, delicious portion! The outer shell was crispy and the filling (peas and cheese) was savory and piping hot. The red sauce was zesty and plentiful. This was probably my favorite dish out of the whole dinner! Next, I had the Ravioli con Fichi, which consisted of three fig-stuffed ravioli pieces drizzled in a medium-consistency white sauce. It was definitely a different experience! The fig was sweet and nice, but it didn't take long for me to get tired of its taste. Ultimately, the portion of this dish was on the small side to me. I tried a few pieces of my friend's gnocchi dish and it didn't wow me like the ones I've had in the North End. My third dish was the Vegano Ravioli. SO yummy! I loved the chunky sauce (here's where the bread comes in handy!!) and the medley of fresh vegetables they used."
84,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,7/9/2019,"So, this last time I dined at Terramia was maybe the 10th time over the past 20 years coming to Boston.  I realized that I had never written a review of this amazing restaurant. I remember my first dinning experience and the food and service is just as good and wonderful as the first time (I even see some of the same staff over the years).  Of course I and my party this time had to start with the Frittelle di Aragosta, one of the best starters of a meal on any menu in any restaurant.  On this occasion our party of 3 shared the swordfish special, the Gnocchi with mushrooms, and the Chicken Marsala.  Each bite of each selection was a bite to remember. Service was as always attentive but not overbearing. The cozy atmosphere in this small restaurant was as always almost as dinning in your own home.  We ended our meal with perhaps the best tiramisu you can ever have.  Thank you the staff and chefs of Terramia for another wonderful meal and the memories of dinning in your restaurant for over 20 years.  I can't wait for the next time I come to Boston to dine again at Terramia."
85,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,10/14/2019,"We found Terramia when I was searching for some Vegan Italian options for a special family dinner in Boston.

We knew we were lucky to find Vegan Options in the North End, but we didn't realize just how lucky until we went Saturday Night.

The Vegan Ravioli was AMAZING, and the Vegan Risotto was INCREDIBLE.

Our meat-eating family got Oyster Linguini and something else and enjoyed it as well.

Everyone was impressed with the cozy, intimate atmosphere and the amazing, quick service.

We will definitely be back!"
86,Terramia Ristorante,3 star rating,8/30/2020,"Dine here often but Friday night the Bolognese dish had NO meat in the sauce.  For $23 it was disappointing to have just a cream tomato sauce .
Still gave it 3 stars because the eggplant appetizer 
And my wife's Carbonara was very good."
87,Terramia Ristorante,5 star rating,5/5/2018,"I felt like I was in Italy when I walked in here . We callled to aak how long the wait would be and the gentleman said come right now and I will have a table for u . Sure enough, there was the best table by the window waiting . The advice was amazing and the food and wine even better . My favorite dinner out in Boston."
88,Terramia Ristorante,2 star rating,3/14/2019,"Was a cute little place. Was quite disappointed in the service we received. Out of Towners wanting to enjoy a little Italian on our trip to Boston. 

The food was edible at best. Multiple over or undercooked things. We decided to do the restaurant week 3 course menu since it happened to be happening and we wanted to sample some things. 

Our server barely spoke to us. I think we had more interactions with the bus boy. The server never even said his name, never asked us how anything was, and never even thanked us when we paid and left. 

We made a 6.45p reservation. Arrived about 5 minutes early. And left the place before 7.20p. We were rushed through every course. It seemed like the minute something left the table the next course came. We were not given fresh silverware even though this was a ""white table cloth"" place. 

All in all disappointed and would not recommend. We felt as though because we did restaurant week. They just wanted our money and to turn our table as quick as possible. 

Being both industry people we were highly disappointed."
89,Terramia Ristorante,3 star rating,7/3/2019,"My wife and I dined here earlier this week.
Seated right away even though it was busy in the North End.  Drinks served promptly.
Efficient waiter but he never smiled once.  Never did I feel my presence was appreciated.
My wife had Ravioli alla Amatriciana and was very happy with it.
I had Spaghetti con Polpette (meat balls) and I was very unhappy.  Pasta so ""al dente"" I could barely eat it.  Meat balls dense, chewy, and not very tasty.  Sauce was good.
Oh, the bread was very good."
0,The Emory,5 star rating,3/12/2022,"In writing a review for The Emory, I really don't know where to start. About a month ago I walked into The Emory (I'm a Beacon Hill local), and grabbed a seat at the bar.

A man approached me--he would soon introduce himself as the owner: Andy. Andy is a gentleman of the highest caliber, and he truly runs an unparalleled establishment. Andy, along with the chefs, waitresses, etc gave me recommendations on menu items (disclaimer: you can't go wrong, everything on the menu looks great, and will leave you in awe upon enjoying. Andy welcomes my friends when I bring them in, he treats his own staff so very well, and fosters a family-esque employee environment. 

Andy, thank you for being such a gracious host, and holding your restaurant to the caliber it is.

Every single staff member I spoke with treated me with the utmost respect, treated me as a friend, and continually welcome me back.

Establishments such as The Emory are a rarity. In my mind's eye, this is the number one restaurant in Boston--no competition.

Thank you Andy and team. I'll see you very soon!Dumplings"
1,The Emory,4 star rating,2/16/2022,"Came here on a quiet Tuesday night and had shishito peppers, olives, dumplings, fries, and the asparagus salad. Peppers, olives and fries were great, but the dumplings were bland, as was the salad. Yes, yes, salad was bland. But it could have a good dressing or something to make it taste better than the sum of its parts. 

I also had the Resting Peach Face cocktail which was not really sour or spicy to me but more refreshing."
2,The Emory,5 star rating,1/13/2022,"Just landed from Los Angeles.  Had the cocktail with persimmon(Beacon of midtown).  Unreal.  I ordered a second.  Fries with garlic aioli then lobster gnocchi.  Superb.  Had a bite of the burger and I couldn't believe how good it was.  Stuff was accessible friendly and quick.  Will be back. 

Thank you!!"
3,The Emory,5 star rating,10/23/2021,"We didn't spend more than an hour at this atmospheric restaurant/bar on the ground floor of a historic Boston Apartment building (21 Beacon), but during those 50 minutes the experience was flawless. 

Recommend sitting at the bar for its showy selection of spirits arranged in front of an immense mirror allowing a view of the action throughout the restaurant. Our bartender wasn't super chatty but friendly and was a very competent mixologist, as he was put  through his paces shaking up gin gimlets for some insatiable bar mates. I asked him to fix something creative with rye and he mixed a ""Lower East Side"", a sweet spicy combo of rye, sour cherry brandy, nutmeg and all spice, and some egg white that provided a layer of white foam to top off the beverage. 

Wife ordered the Garden Party, a Vodka and lime suffused with cucumber and a bit too sweet for her, but I thought it worked well. 

The surprising treat were the dumplings, vegetarian with mushroom and garlic purée. Only four with an order and I could have dined on a mountain of them but we had dinner plans. 

Next time we will definitely plan to stay for a proper meal and soak in more of this quintessential Old Boston ambiance."
4,The Emory,5 star rating,12/8/2021,"We came here for pre-dinner drinks on a Friday night. We were able to grab a table quickly compared to some other places nearby where they wait was at least an hour. We didn't order food, but were tempted since it smelled and looked delicious.

We ordered a dirty gin martini and Peeper's Punch, both were excellent. Great service and fun vibe!"
5,The Emory,3 star rating,9/22/2021,"Food 2/5 (can really be a hit or miss)
Drinks 4/5 
Atmosphere 4/5 
Service 3.5/5 (the 20% gratitude is included in the bill)

I came here because of the high yelp score for this restaurant but I'm very disappointed with the food I guess when checking yelp you really need to take into consideration of the number of reviewed posted too.

Food: we ordered tuna crudo ( four pieces of tuna and 5 pieces of avocado). Fish tasted very fresh.
Lamb tartare is good too. Overall good lamb with tons of potato chips.
Burger: this is a huge disappointment. Probably one of the worst burger I've ever had. We ordered medium, but it came out like well done. The meat patties are super dry and had zero flavor. Cheese and pickles were the only other stuff presented on the burger. I don't get it how could a burger be cooked to such condition‍

Atmosphere was good. Very quiet and speak easy.

Service was ok. She is very nice and quick to attend our table. And only checked in with out table once. She had to come back to ask how we wanted the burger to be cooked even tho we mentioned while ordering. The restaurant included 20% tip in the bill for a table for 2.

Probably won't come back since there are plenty of other good restaurants nearby with better food and better price."
6,The Emory,4 star rating,7/11/2021,"Came here for dinner last night and would overall say the experience was average. The vibe and ambiance was intimate and nice. Our waiter didn't really make an effort to sell us on the menu or tell us his recommendations though a significant automatic gratuity was applied.

My husband and I shared the charred corn salad, scallops, and mushroom dumplings. I would say out of these the dumplings were the most tasty and appropriately portioned. The scallops were good but only two were served in the portion and it definitely could have been doubled for the same price and still be a light share. The charred corn salad could have used more corn and more dressing, as it was mainly greens and cotija. 

For our meal we split the burger and had it medium well. The meat was good but the bun was oily and there wasn't much in terms of garnish to the burger at all. The fries were crispy and yummy which helped.

The cocktails we had were well made and prepared. All in all would say the place has a lot of potential but not sure I would run back."
7,The Emory,5 star rating,3/5/2022,Came here for brunch and had a great experience. Kitchen makes everything from scratch including some delicious house made donuts! Service was attentive and the owner Andy is very personable and welcoming.
8,The Emory,5 star rating,1/14/2022,"We came in for dinner on our first night in Boston. The atmosphere is nice and the food and drinks were amazing! We ordered the pomme frites (fries with parmesan and garlic aoli), lobster gnocchi, and the double stack burger. Everything was beyond delicious and the texture of the fries were perfect. The owner, Andy, personally came and chatted with us and was really cool. The rest of the staff were great and personable as well. I highly recommend this spot to anyone in/visiting Boston!"
9,The Emory,5 star rating,4/3/2022,"The cocktails,  waitstaff and hostess were amazing! Everyone was pleasant and helpful, most of the menu items were under $20 and great for sharing."
10,The Emory,4 star rating,3/21/2022,"I've only been here once, but I fell in love right away. It went straight to on of my favorite eating places. The venue is particularly lovely at night. Very elegant, and it appears to be very effortless- which it most likely hasn't been. 

They have a wide range of meals, and my biggest ""problem"" was deciding what to get. That's something I'm not very good at. The food appears to be great and tastes great! 

Their team has also been quite kind, despite the fact that they were extremely busy - as they are most of the time. 

I am actually about to go there right now!"
11,The Emory,5 star rating,4/1/2022,Amazing service and unbelievable food! Lots of vegetarian options. Will be back 100% !!
12,The Emory,5 star rating,12/18/2021,"Wow, came here from out of town for brunch and it was exquisite. Make sure to get the kitchen bar so you get a meal and a show while you watch their fantastic chefs make your food. Food was absolutely amazing, service was great, and everyone was so friendly. Very welcoming place with a relaxed fun vibe.  Highly recommend the pomme frites and lobster eggs Benedict. 10/10, five stars, such a great experience. This is where to go for brunch at Boston."
13,The Emory,5 star rating,11/18/2021,"We were in town for an evening and found The Emory after walking up Beacon Hill.  It's in a great space that added to the overall experience.  We had a really good dinner as we were looking for an alternative to the standard seafood dinner on a Boston visit.  
The staff was very friendly, offering some great suggestions for drinks, dinner, and dessert.  The owner stopped by and gave us some history on the building and the area, which we really enjoyed.  
I've added The Emory to my list as a place I'll visit on every trip back to Boston."
14,The Emory,5 star rating,8/14/2021,"My husband and I were not planning on eating here, but the waitstaff was so funny and inviting. How could we refuse?

The restaurant is beautiful and the food/drinks were just fantastic. The salted cucumber lemonade was nice and refreshing on a hot, humid day. I highly recommend it. The gnocchi was also delicious, but it was really the dessert that stole the show! The pot de cremé was so dense and the homemade whipped cream on top fluffy and flavorful.

Everyone there, including the owner, were just so kind, attentive, and genuine. This place is a huge Must Try, especially if you're just passing through on vacation."
15,The Emory,5 star rating,9/23/2021,"Visited The Emory for the first time tonight and had a chance to meet Andy (owner) while simultaneously  take in the beautiful design that blended legacy architecture with modern design and stuff my face with elevated American cuisine that was exactly what I was working for. 

We started with the poutine because...poutine. It was tremendous. Despite dripping with cheese and a bit of gravy and sausage (the way I like it) the fries still had crunch and upheld structure while pairing with the other ""sauces"". My colleague and I both had the burger and couldn't help but comment how well seasoned the burger was. 

On top of the visual aesthetics and delicious taste score, Andy and his staff were super personable. Our waiter was so fun and Andy rotated in to make us feel welcome. I acknowledged that my favorite part may have been the bar/lounge feel with hip hop vibes.... But that was before I had the poutine. 

This is a new place with great vibes and great vibes but has suffered being new just before and during quarantine. Do yourself a favor and check it out now that things are a little better."
16,The Emory,4 star rating,9/23/2021,"They didn't have ranch but the food was delicious otherwise. Steak was juicy, fries had a good saltiness / crust factor. Great Yelp find!  Also loved the ambiance. I didn't see a kids menu online but they were able to do a hot dog and that was a win for our son!  Great service, except they included an automatic tip for a party of 3 so that was a little lame."
17,The Emory,4 star rating,2/11/2022,Just got ripped off at the Fine Dinner restaurant around the corner. Should have come here first. Prices look good. Menu looks interesting.  And this Chocolate Pudding is off the hook.
18,The Emory,5 star rating,6/19/2021,"There just aren't enough stars!!
Found this restaurant online during my recent weekend trip to Boston. Don't let their recent start 2 years ago (right before COVID hit) distract you from this incredible culinary gem. The food...where to begin...this is the perfect place for sharing plates. From the eclectic drink menu (we had the salted cucumber lemonade mocktail & a rose sangria), to the sirloin and the best scallops ever, to the burrata salad paired with fresh cucumbers & the charred corn salad, to the pomme frites, every morsel was layered with flavor & each bite was impeccably spiced. The presentation was beautiful & well thought out for each dish, and that coupled with the perfect level of attentive yet never intrusive service by their team made this an all around great dining experience. The owner, Andy came over to our table like an old friend, sharing insights into their opening, the history of their stunning space with open kitchen, & his vision for what is obviously his pride & joy. I was even invited into the building to meet the super talented chef behind all that glorious food! As those of you who read my reviews know, I have an all time short list of best restaurants EVER, and The Emory is getting a place right up at the top of this list. Run...don't walk to this incredible restaurant before it becomes impossible to get a table once the word gets out!"
19,The Emory,5 star rating,2/25/2022,"This place is terrific. We love family owned restaurants and concepts. This place certainly fits that bill, and their attitude pays it! We had a great meal with our 4 kids, and everyone left happy. The menu is inventive and fun. The owner came over to the table to chat with us. We really enjoyed our evening. Read the story behind this place. You can't help but feel endeared to it!"
20,The Emory,5 star rating,2/26/2022,"Dining at The Emory was an amazing experience. The food was phenomenal, and the owner even swung by to welcome us. Super friendly staff and amazing food"
21,The Emory,4 star rating,7/31/2021,"A good american option in Downtown Boston with some interesting menu items. Note This review only covers snacks, small plates, and dessert. 

We ate out on the nice patio and the service was friendly and attentive. We ordered the candied nuts and chips and onion dip snacks to start, both were good. We then ordered the corn salad and the dumplings shareable plates for our next course. The corn salad was quite good as were the dumplings. The entrees all looked very good and we will try next time. 

For dessert we ordered the peach cobbler. The cobbler was the let down of the meal as it was in no way a fruit cobbler. The peach cobbler was a small skillet containing a sugar cookie that was topped with vanilla ice cream that had peach sauce drizzled across the ice cream to make it ""peach"" ice cream. I found one small peach chunk at some point on top of the cookie below the ice cream. The chef/owners of The Emory clearly do not know what peach cobbler is or how you make it. Luckily the cookie and vanilla ice cream tasted good, so that saved it. 

All in all a good option in downtown, but skip the peach cobbler unless you are in the mood for sugar cookies and vanilla ice cream."
22,The Emory,5 star rating,2/20/2022,"Walked in 7:45pm in a Saturday night, place was bustling.  The greater was super nice but didn't have anything as he was holding a table for a reservation.  (Who was over 20 minutes late). After a little fun back and forth he sat us at the table.  Turns out he was the owner, Andy, who pitched in the entire night.  We ordered a bunch of food burger, great, chicken sandwich, great, everything we had was at least very good."
23,The Emory,3 star rating,11/11/2021,"Decent food, overpriced. Check your bill for tip included...for a party of 4? I realized I tipped 40% when I checked receipt after leaving. 
Even w/o that, the food was overpriced for what you get."
24,The Emory,4 star rating,2/12/2022,"Great drinks, relaxed atmosphere, interesting menu items.  Good pregame spot for an Orpheum show"
25,The Emory,5 star rating,2/24/2020,"Drinks review only. I came in at around 4:30 on a Thursday and waited for my friends to arrive. I sat at the bar and there were a couple of larger groups hanging around (looked like coworkers). 

The bartender was super friendly and we chatted about different spirits and cocktails. She even showed me her cool bee tattoo after I ordered my 2nd drink (a bees knees) and told me about a bees knees event she went to. Pretty cool! The bartender mentioned that she made my bees knees different from the standard and what tasting notes came from where. I appreciated the cocktail facts. She knew her stuff!

My first drink was on-menu and was a Top of the Hill (Rittenhouse Rye, Lemon-Sage, Cinzano Bianco). It was explained as kind of a ""white manhattan"" and was delicious. When my first friend arrived, he ordered a Smoke 'Em Out (Peloton Mezcal, Chamucos Reposado, Agave) and that drink was heaven for someone who likes mezcal and a smokey flavor. I tried a mezcal drink at Roxanne's afterwards and the Smoke 'Em Out blew it out of the water! Other drinks imbibed were The Aftermath and Kentucky Downs.

All of the cocktails were delicious. They were ""Boston priced"" at $11-14 each, but that is to be expected with this level of mixology. I'm definitely adding this to my list of favorite cocktail spots in Boston."
26,The Emory,5 star rating,11/7/2021,"Cute place, great food, super friendly staff. Win win win!!"
27,The Emory,5 star rating,6/26/2021,Exquisite! Delicious small plates and amazing drinks! Very knowledgeable waitstaff with spot-on recommendations.
28,The Emory,5 star rating,12/26/2021,"Stopped in here for dinner prior to catching a show. We got a bunch of small plates to share, all of which were delicious. Nice cocktails too. Wait staff were incredibly friendly, as was the owner who came out and spoke to us. Would definitely go back!"
29,The Emory,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"Came to The Emory for Sunday brunch. You can tell the owner, waitstaff, and chefs are passionate about what they do! Lobster Benedict and the Spinach, Tomato, avocado Benedict were both delicious! Their potatoes and homemade hot sauce were fabulous; the cold brew and spicy Bloody Mary were both a must! Outdoor seating was lovely as we got to watch all the tour buses go by. Hopefully we will be back soon!"
30,The Emory,5 star rating,6/5/2021,I've been wanting to catch Andy for a bit at The Emory. I was pleasantly impressed with the decor and soundtrack. The back is super cool - especially with the Miller High Life clock radiating a funky yellow haze to contrast the awesome wallpaper. I have to give a big shout out to Ester and her stellar wines selections that she introduced me to. I will definitely come back to visit!
31,The Emory,2 star rating,2/16/2020,"Sorely disappointed. We arrived here for dinner when wanting to check out something new with good reviews. So many things wrong. 

First off, the menu has nothing on it. It's got a grand total of 3 entrees and 7 apps that they couldn't even bother to separate into different categories. 

Secondly, the entrees are the absolute bare bones. I've never seen such horrible plating on a dish, check out the steak -- what is that? Use a long thinner plate if you're going to offer nothing to the side. The dishes come with the absolute most minium side offering I've ever seen. At these prices I expect better. Even if you wanted to pay extra, the menu doesn't offer any sides to add. 

We left hungry and disappointed. Saving this from a 1 star review is that the drinks tasted good."
32,The Emory,5 star rating,11/27/2021,Stopped in for a late lunch. The burger and the eggs Benedict were awesome. Decor and atmosphere are absolutely lovely. Friendly staff. We will be back.
33,The Emory,4 star rating,7/11/2021,"They took great care of our party of seven and made us feel like we were the only people there on a Saturday night.  The asparagus salad was tasty, the Sauvignon blanc that I enjoyed with my salad was buttery and smooth.  Overall a very pleasant experience.  They have a very limited menu for kids."
34,The Emory,5 star rating,7/4/2021,Awesome brunch and great staff. Andy came by multiple times to check on us and gave us great tips for others places to check out. The food was awesome and the place is very eclectic and sexy on the inside. Will visit again.
35,The Emory,5 star rating,11/5/2021,"My friends and I met here for dinner on a Friday evening. The food and drinks were all fantastic, but the best part of our experience was the service. Our server, Justin, was great and attentive. The owner, Andy, made us feel so welcome. He introduced himself to our table and checked on us throughout the night. He made our dining experience more fun and memorable. I highly recommend the Emory!!!"
36,The Emory,4 star rating,9/20/2019,"Solid spot for drinks and, if you don't mind shelling out some bucks, the food is great too. The Emory is definitely on the pricey side, but they deliver with quality service, a small-but-thoughtful beer selection, and a delicious menu.

I had a Maine Beer Co APA at the bar before moving to a table. The bartender was on her game, very personable and quick with service.

After moving to a table, I tried the cheese board, which comes with three types of cheese, pickled peppers, and crackers. It was delicious, with a good variety of cheeses, but its $18 pricetag was a little jarring. Still, this is a great spot for a date or a drink if you're in the area and want to get away from the more pub-like spots near the Commons."
37,The Emory,5 star rating,7/25/2020,"The Emory has a fantastic space in beacon hill right next to the state house. The patio is adorable and has acrylic dividers between tables for ample COVID safety. We got two cocktails and loved them both - the top of the hill was reminiscent of an old fashioned and the rum punch was great. For food, we got the ceviche which we devoured before we could get a picture. The batter in the crispy wings was sooo good, you don't even need to use the hot sauce and ranch to get tons of flavor but we enjoyed them both ways. We also got the burrata which was also great, served with grilled veggies. All around would recommend! It's in the former Scollay Square space for those who know Boston well."
38,The Emory,5 star rating,9/11/2020,"Great food, great service! If you want outdoor dining they have an amazing set up. Indoors is super clean, spaces out, and rules are enforced for masks ans social
Distancing!

Get the chicken wings and chicken sandwich for sure! Don't miss their homemade ranch and hot sauce. Staff is professional and personable. Dog is good value and high quality"
39,The Emory,5 star rating,9/19/2019,"Fun, funky atmosphere.  Outdoor seating and indoor high tops with open kitchen.  Unique menu.  Definitely worth checking out."
40,The Emory,4 star rating,5/11/2020,"We work around the corner and decided to visit for a team birthday lunch. Friendly and prompt service, despite our larger group size. The space is lovely, with that new-hipster mix of classic antique and modern (think elaborate columns with mid-century modern barstools). 

This is more of a snacky atmosphere, between the small plates and charcuterie boards. You're paying for the high-quality ingredients, rather than for a high quantity of food. Everything we tried was delicious, though. Probably select another dining option if you're starving, unless you're going to order the burger, which seemed pretty hefty! 

Their cocktails were interesting and inventive. Looking forward to coming back here for after-work drinks and apps soon!"
41,The Emory,5 star rating,9/25/2021,"Best brunch around! The owner and the staff are amazingly friendly and knowledgeable. The food is fresh and delicious and the drinks are so, so good. The charred marg is one of the best margarita's I have had. Go here now!"
42,The Emory,5 star rating,8/25/2021,Great menu meets great design supported by passionate hands-on owner and waitstaff. It's stunning space. Loved our meal. Gnocchi and Burrata were delicious. And the garlic aioli with the pommes frites would make anything taste good! Can't wait to go back when I'm in town.
43,The Emory,5 star rating,6/17/2021,"Fantastic spot just off the Common. Great for a date or a larger gathering when that's a thing again. We've been a few times now, 2 pre-Covid and 1 coming out of Covid the day after they reopened and it's been a great experience each time."
44,The Emory,4 star rating,8/23/2020,"The Emory was a last minute decision. We are visiting for a couple days and glad we stopped in! I got the Emory burger and my girlfriend got the fried chicken sandwich. I tell you what... these are two pretty standard plates, right?... well if you want a perfect burger and you want what could be the best fried chicken sandwich... check out the Emory.  The burger came searing hot and juicy and the chicken was crisp, tender and seasoned down!!! I got a side of fries and they were prepared well and seasoned perfect... and the make good drinks! GO HERE PEOPLE! 
I hope to not just make the Emory a memory

45,The Emory,5 star rating,7/24/2021,"All I know is, we had been walking for about an hour and a half and this place was on our list of ""places to try"" in Boston, so here we went. Great service--I forget our waiter's name, but he was fun and helpful in placing our order. We split the poutine and double burger. Best choice. I would've eaten the whole burger myself tho. Poutine gravy was super good--and the burger had such good flavor. GREAT fries. Overall--it was a good time. Thanks!"
46,The Emory,5 star rating,8/20/2021,My wife and I were late for an appointment but very hungry. The staff seated us immediately. Took our order of cocktails and appetizers. The drinks and the food came out quickly and was amazingly good.
47,The Emory,3 star rating,11/12/2021,"Wife and I went there last night (Thursday around 7) for dinner and were able to get seated right away. Overall not impressed even though there were some highlights. Started out with Scallop Ceviche, which seemed to be shrimp in a watery salsa. Moving on to a charcuterie board that was placed on the table with no description of the content, which appeared to be a two salamis, some prosciutto, grainy mustard and pickled vegetables. The vegetables were fresh and crunchy with a good taste, but the meats were pretty forgettable. We also had the Shaved Asparagus Salad, which had a nice fresh dressing, but the asparagus must have been cooked and dampened the overall impression. We shared the Steak Frites, which was the highlight of the dinner, incredibly tender and good taste, can definitely recommend that. We finished off with the Pot de Creme, had a good taste with a kick to it, but was served very cold, which somewhat ruined the overall impression. Not sure why this restaurant has such a high rating, it's not bad but there are better restaurants that in that area."
48,The Emory,5 star rating,1/9/2020,"Great food and service all around. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. The interior was beautiful and a great marriage of vintage and modern.

There were these amazing potato beignets with a cream and bacon bits on the bottom. We had two orders. The oysters were fresh and spot on as well. French fries were great, as well as braised carrots.

We came in on a Saturday night and it wasn't overly busy. Great safe neighborhood and we we're able
To find parking. We ate like kings and the bill was reasonable. I highly recommend the Emory. :)"
49,The Emory,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"Food was amazing, staff was great, restaurant itself is sexy (as my wife put it). Highly recommend!"
50,The Emory,2 star rating,11/20/2019,"I rarely write reviews, but I felt compelled to share my experience here. I initially visited The Emory in October 2019, and I absolutely loved it. Unfortunately, I went back again last night (late November 2019) and was exceptionally disappointed in this experience. 

When my friend and I went last night, it could not have been more different from the initial visit. I ordered the exact same thing as the first time--the baked potato beignets and the burger. On my first visit, the beignets were absolutely amazing. Last night, the beignets were very under-cooked: the center was completely gooey/doughy. 

Back when I went in October, the burger was one of the best I'd had in Boston. Last night, it was very mediocre. It did not have any onion jam (which is the best part!), and had far too much cheese. I'd raved about the burger so much to my friend, and then we got them, it was so underwhelming. 

I also had two of the leaf peeper cocktails, and while they tasted delicious, they seemingly had 0 alcohol. Two cocktails should make me feel something, and I felt like I just had two glasses of water.

Such a shame to have a terrible follow up to an initially awesome experience. Completely disappointing. Will not be coming back and would not recommend."
51,The Emory,4 star rating,2/14/2020,"Pretty decent place. Very friendly and good service. Nice urban and classy ambiance. The food is well priced, very reasonable. Although I should add the portions are a bit underwhelming.

We got the beet salad, which is quite tiny; salmon crudo, it's very well seasoned/marinated, though bit small; And burgers. The cheese on the burger is very flavorful, but I think the paddy could be a little bigger- It's kind of fast-food joint sized, not as much restaurant sized paddy. I don't mind paying a couple dollars more for a bigger, fatter paddy :)

Overall, very nice experience, will return again."
52,The Emory,5 star rating,12/28/2019,"Really great service and really great food and nice ambience.

The drink menu is specially curated and has really awesome mixes of flavors and twists on classics.

The menu here has just enough to have some choice and not feel overwhelmed. I firmly believe that a menu that is too big, generally, will mean that nothing is great and any choice will be mediocre at best. The Emory really does a great job. My friend and I had a nice selection of oysters, mushroom dip, beignets, and these delicious roasted carrots.

The wine menu is really nice and carefully selected. The bartender/bar manager really knows her stuff.

The place is on the smaller side with a few tables inside and less than 10 seats at the bar.

Great service and great food!"
53,The Emory,3 star rating,10/4/2019,"My experience at The Emory did not match the 4 star plus Yelp review others have given. Everything tasted fine, but it wasn't exceptional. 

The menu is fairly limited with most variety in the small plates. We opted for the beets (generic, but tasty) and the mushroom dip (overpriced and somewhat unbalanced as there was far too much cream). The entrees vary widely in price, so if you want to avoid spending roughly $40, your options are limited to a $19 burger. That's the route we took- it was well cooked, but like the beets, nothing special. 

The drinks are solid and fairly priced, but the limited selection and high price point left me wanting more variety and a better value."
54,The Emory,4 star rating,12/8/2019,"I went to Emory for brunch on a Saturday, and had a great experience. I had a Bloody Mary and the burger, both of which were great. 

The burger is covered in cheese and comes with very good fries - I would go back just to eat that.

Hoping to go back for dinner soon!"
55,The Emory,5 star rating,2/29/2020,"First time visit from out of town. My dish, the pan seared salmon was cooked to perfection. The texture and flavors just right. My son's burger equally delicious according to him and my husband's Brussels Sprouts, I finished off for him yum! My only wish... a more expanded dinner menu to include not just single dishes but full
entrees."
56,The Emory,5 star rating,1/23/2020,This is a place where you can only.find 0n the dark side of the moon. Where mystical beings are found. Excellent selection of whiskeys are also found here. But honestly just some great people and some dead sexy men to find.
57,The Emory,5 star rating,9/9/2019,"Cool space, wonderful staff and owner, and great meal. I'm traveling for business and found this  restaurant and wanted to give it a try. And the moment I walked in until I just finished my meal it was perfect. I had potato beignets, the Emery burger, and pistachio ice cream. Forgot to take a picture of the ice cream it looked ( and tasted ) so good! Highly recommend this restaurant. Come after work, with a date, or alone. It's perfect."
58,The Emory,5 star rating,8/21/2019,"We loved The Emory and are excited to have it as a new addition to local places in Beacon Hill! We had heard good things and thought we'd try it out on a weeknight. We sat on the spacious outdoor patio, a nice touch as that's a rarity on beacon hill. Andy, the owner, checked in on us regularly and offered advice and friendly conversation. He's a sommelier so there's a strong wine list and we loved the wine we selected, a red from the Loire valley. There's also a strong cocktail list. Food wise, the steak tartare is a definite hit. We loved the tomato salad, and the pappardelle as well. Thanks for a great meal, we'll be back!"
59,The Emory,2 star rating,8/18/2019,"My fiancé and I brought a couple of friends to Emory. They just landed in Boston and were not that hungry so we thought that the Emory would be a good option to share some small plates and have a drink. The first thing we noticed is that the space is beautifully decorated with nice ambiance. The staff is very good too; our waiter was very polite and nice and offered good explanation of the dishes when we asked while checking the menu. 

The experience was great until we started receiving the our plates... This is what we ordered:

.- Shrimp Escabeche: The first thing you notice when you get it is that small plate takes another dimension there... what they call small to me it would be something closer to minuscule... The plate basically contained two shrimps that where cut in a half so it seemed you had 4. We all agreed that the shrimp tasted to nothing.

.- Stripped Bass Crudo: Another example of minuscule plate... I get that thing of small and beautiful plates in good restaurants... but again, that was a little too much in my opinion. The bass was on the bland side too... To be fair, two of us thought the crudo was in fact decent... Still on the bland side but decent. 

.- Fries: Not that much to say. You cannot go wring with fries. Only mentioning that fires is exactly what you get... Don't expect truffled oil, seasoning, rosemary... nope. Just fries. 

Overall, a price extremely overpriced... Even if as I mentioned the space is beautiful and the stuff is great, for the price you pay you can find better places with much better food."

Keep it up"
61,The Emory,5 star rating,12/28/2019,"Great choice! We found this restaurant on Resy. We had a party of 5 and my 3 year old niece. Upon sitting, we were attended to instantly. The cocktails are TO DIE FOR. They made my mom a rum punch that she actually drank (plus 2 more lol) and I got the leaf peeper, which was phenomenal. We started off with the charcuterie board, the potatoe beignets and the mushroom dip (all solid choices)! For our entrees we had the skirt steak (cooked to perfection), scallops and salmon. My niece polished off the salmon.  Speaking of my niece, they even went out of their way to print pictures out for her to color while we ate. I highly recommend ordering their ice cream for dessert. Extremely fresh and topped with the best Feuilletine  I've ever had! Our waiter was Michael and he was extremely attentive and knowledgable about the menu. I'd 10/10 return if I ever came back to Boston!"
62,The Emory,5 star rating,10/17/2020,Food was amazing service was great . A real gem ! Portions we a good size . Cocktails was fabulous.
63,The Emory,1 star rating,10/14/2020,"I dined in at the Emory a few weeks ago. Our waiter was very nice and helpful and the owner was friendly. Unfortunately, I am overall disappointed in the Emory. 
The food took an extremely long time to come out to my party of 5. We waited over an hour after placing our order. After waiting for over an hour, the burger I ordered was undercooked and had to have them recook it. 
On top of that, I discovered the next day my card was overcharged $5. I have called the restaurant 3 times and emailed them over the last two week but yet to receive a response. 
I hope to hear back from them to get a refund but I am EXTREMELY disappointed with my experience with the Emory."
64,The Emory,4 star rating,9/15/2019,"Went here for dinner while visiting Boston. They have a great cocktail menu (I got 3 ""Jackie O"" cocktails)- excellent drink!!

I ordered the burger with fries and the meat was very fresh, however. I wasn't impressed with the menu.  It didn't have anything that genuinely excited me. I also wish the fries were truffle or garlic flavored (since the burger was pretty simple- just had pickles and cheese sauce). The ambiance is cool and the service was great."
65,The Emory,5 star rating,10/21/2019,"This restaurant/bar is in a beautiful building, and the food and drinks are equally beautiful.  Food is prepared right in front of you and the chefs take great care in ensuring perfection.  
Drinks are some of the best I've ever had.  If you want Eastern Standard quality drinks without the attitudes this is the place for you."
66,The Emory,4 star rating,1/8/2020,"Visited the Emory recently and had a good experience. I had a glass of wine (prices ranged from 8-15ish) and my boyfriend had the Kentucky downs while we sat at the bar. It was very quiet the entire time we were there (430-630pm on a Tuesday) which was strange because I thought it had a good vibe/decor/space. 
We ordered the cheese plate, heirloom carrots, and the Emory burger. Cheese plate was 3 cheeses and we swapped the crackers for bread which was delicious. Carrots were decent but a little pricey at $12 for 8 carrots. Burger was also good but just a heads up the fries do not look like the picture from yelp! They were veryyyy similar to McDonald's fries. 
Bartender and hostess were very friendly and knowledgable of the menu! 
Bar opens at 4pm but kitchen not until 5pm! Knocking off a star because of the chef being on his phone the whole time we were there - seemed unprofessional especially in an open kitchen setting."
67,The Emory,5 star rating,2/9/2020,"Lovely brunch! The egg sandwich was amazing! Good coffee too. Excellent, friendly service too!"
68,The Emory,5 star rating,12/21/2019,"Looking for a good cocktail on Beacon Hill, happened upon a great place with wonderful bar staff. We will be back and recommend to others!"
69,The Emory,5 star rating,12/29/2019,We were desperate to find something to eat and they had a reservation. The service was so good. They even printed pictures to color for my daughter. The mushroom dip was fantastic. The skirt steak was yummy and had great fried potatoes. They have ice cream from Christina's and it was super creamy. I would love to return
70,The Emory,5 star rating,8/20/2019,"I adore The Emory. I have been there four times now for both lunch and dinner. My friends and I agree that it is one of the best restaurants in Beacon Hill. I've also suggested this restaurant to co-workers, and they were equally impressed. I have had the 
-baked potato beignets- they melt in your mouth. Simply devine. 
-avacado panna cotta- I was reluctant to order because it sounds odd, but this innovative dish is delicious! Very creamy texture. I was sad when my friend took the last bite
-striped bass crudo- typical crudo with a bit of flare with lime and avocado  
-roasted asparagus- so many flavors going on with egg yolk, chilis, and lemon ailoli, yet it all melded perfectly together
-the burger- cheese fondue...onion jam...pickles...pure bliss
-cobb salad- usually not a huge fan of cobb salad, but I loved this one because it's so unique. The salad had the typical components but with mixed greens and arugula for the lettuce along with avocado and finished with a mustard seed vinaigrette that pulled it all together. 

The chef puts a creative twist on traditional dishes and nails it every time. The staff is friendly and attentive as well. Plus, they have a spacious outdoor patio. Can't wait to go back and try more!"
71,The Emory,1 star rating,9/18/2019,"Watch your credit card.

Ok, food was decent.  Pretty standard brunch fare. Good breakfast sandwich, and kid's pasta was very impressive.

Where I take issue is fraud.  My family dined with another family and we split the check.  The other family ordered drinks when we did not, so they left the tip.  I did not leave a tip as a result.  To my unpleasant surprise, the waiter must have added a $32 tip (on a $77 bill) and signed my name.  Good thing I kept the customer receipt as proof.  I've never had a waiter change his tip."
72,The Emory,4 star rating,9/19/2019,"I think this place can get it right, but there are a few kinks to work out. First the positives - the entire staff from our waiter to the manager and busboy were great. Awesome service. I have numerous allergies/food sensitivities and they really took the time to make sure I was taken care of. The cocktails were excellent and the beer and wine selection was good. We had some good charcuterie but the portions were very small for the price, and our main dish, the seared black bass, was very good. Room to grow: $3 for oysters from Massachusetts and Rhode Island is a bit pricey. The fries were very small (maybe we got the bottom of the basket) and similar to another reviewer, nothing special. We ordered the carrots which needed salt and lacked flavor. Lastly, the music choice was really odd - mid 2000s frat party jams - definitely didn't vibe with the rest of the space."
73,The Emory,5 star rating,8/26/2019,"We really enjoyed this new addition to the Beacon Hill - Downtown border. A long awaited change from the previous tenant, with a great facelift to the interior, cool vibe and attentive service. Since the restaurant was new, their wine list wasn't completely stocked, and keep in mind when they say small plates they really mean small, but this was a welcome addition and a much better use of the rare outdoor space on the hill. Looking forward to returning!"
74,The Emory,5 star rating,9/19/2019,The Emory Burger was amazing. Seriously the best burger I have had in a long time! Also the cocktails were tasty.
75,The Emory,5 star rating,1/23/2020,We stumbled upon this place at 11pm and they welcomed us in with open arms. The owner and bartender were the most friendly I've ever Cale across from Boston. We missed the food but I can guarantee you this is a perfect neighborhood bar. A must do stop.  They have great cocktail and a full bar for anything you may want to drink. Come in and support a local business
76,The Emory,5 star rating,11/10/2019,"Visiting from Austin, TX to surprise my sister for her 21st birthday we chose The Emory for her birthday dinner. We chose The Emory because it's industry established and we have been in the restaurant industry for years. Also, it looked adorable, and it was.

Unfortunately, their hours were listed online that the kitchen was open until midnight so we made our reservation at 9:30. We were seated promptly and greeted friendly. Still waiting for my sister to arrive after her late soccer practice, our server informed us that the kitchen closes at 10. We were devastated as we planned on a full course birthday dinner. Their manager, Jess, was sent over promptly and she apologized tremendously. We were fully expecting to relocate for dinner but then Jess came back to the table and said she spoke with the chef and he would let us order whatever we wanted even though it was after their closing time! We ended up LOVING our intelligently thought out plates and had a full course dinner filled with complimentary birthday treats. We, of course, bought the kitchen a round for taking care of us!

We then hopped over to their in house bar, which IS open until midnight, and enjoyed a lovely bottle of Cab with a very friendly bartender. Jess continued to make sure we were taken care of throughout our entire experience. She absolutely went above and beyond to show us hospitality and we could not have been more grateful for a memorable birthday dinner! Stop by and support them. You won't be disappointed. Cheers, The Emory!"
77,The Emory,4 star rating,12/12/2019,"Recently went here for date night, and it's a small restaurant with moody lighting close to the park and downtown. Each bite was delicious."
78,The Emory,5 star rating,8/26/2019,"The Emory was incredible. The Buffalo sweetbreads, baked potato beignets, avocado panna cotta and the sirloin tartare were all delicious. The entire menu is an adventure! Everything we ordered was on the recommendation of our phenomenal server Michael. He really made the experience for us and he was a joy to have as part of the dining experience. The cocktail selection was incredible too. The Jackie O, Shine On, and Aftermath were all amazing. To top off the great experience, the owner Andy came to chat with us at the end of the night. He was a wonderful person to talk with and clearly takes a lot of well-deserved pride in his business."
79,The Emory,3 star rating,1/12/2020,I think the bartenders are really sweet and very friendly but I think the food is incredibly overpriced.There are so many choices in this city and I feel like this place would do well and stay there if they lower their prices by a few dollars for certain items on the dinner menu. The burger should not be 19. if they could lower the other items on the menu price wise I think the place will have a good chance of success.    I was there for dinner. I will try brunch the menu seems more reasonable .
80,The Emory,5 star rating,2/9/2020,"We were celebrating a birthday for a great young women and chose The Emory for its location and especially the ambiance. Wow did we make the right choice. The owner Andy has been in the business for a long time and knows how to make great suggestions to make a special event. We had over 80 people and the historic space was perfect.Rather then stick with their normal great menu we went off a bit and it couldn't have been better. We wanted more ""finger food"" than a normal sit down dinner and they accommodated us perfectly. They made the best sliders imaginable and chicken tenders with crispy tasty fries. The passed  hor dourves  were great including an avocado crustinni, sausage ,, meatballs and Foie gras.

If you are looking for a place for up to 100 people for a great event with attentive service, wonderful food, in a fabulous space, look no further than The Emory.  You will not be disappointed."
81,The Emory,3 star rating,10/26/2019,"Good food and very flavorful  but plates were on the smaller side, which was a bummer. I'd go back if The Emory chooses to make their dishes larger!"
82,The Emory,5 star rating,9/16/2019,My husband and I stopped in for  a late lunch when we were in town and loved it.  The potato skin beignets and cobb salad were delicious! The owner was super friendly and our server Tai was excellent.
83,The Emory,5 star rating,8/16/2019,"I love this place, highly recommend!! The vibe is casual yet trendy and the food is to die for. The cocktails are unique and delicious and the staff is what really sets this place apart from others. I recommend sitting at the bar!"
84,The Emory,3 star rating,10/7/2019,"Given all of the raving reviews, we were pretty disappointed by The Emory. We went on a Saturday night, it was not busy (more empty tables than not) and yet we had terrible service. We were there for 2.5 hours and barely saw our waitress and the food took forever. We ordered wine and beer, so nothing that needed to be crafted, and it took 15 minutes to get our first drink after ordering. 

Overall, the food was good - nothing exceptional though, especially for the price. Also the menu was very limited and did not match what we saw online. There were only 4 entrees listed.

The ambiance and decor was cool. We won't be going back."
85,The Emory,5 star rating,2/21/2020,"I don't usually leave reviews on Yelp. However, these guys are amazing period end stop. You can pick anything off the menu and it's ridiculously good."
86,The Emory,5 star rating,8/6/2019,"Extremely friendly, attentive, and passionate staff. Dishes were extremely creative and delicious. The location and atmosphere is probably the best part though, especially sitting outside on an August night!"
87,The Emory,5 star rating,12/22/2019,We ordered several of the small plates and one large plate and quite enjoyed everything! The scallops and risotto were excellent - bonus points to the beautifully executed risotto! We also loved the mushroom dip - it hasn't got that gooey stringy cheese factor you'd expect from a cheesy dip but the flavor is brilliant and honestly easier to eat for not having to fight stringy strands of cheesy goo. Yum yum!
88,The Emory,5 star rating,8/14/2020,"Great place, perfect portions and a fun environment. We had brunch and would come back for dinner."
89,The Emory,5 star rating,8/13/2020,"Best dining experience we've had in a very long time. Our waiter, Danny, was not only extremely personable but very attentive and focused on creating the best experience for us possible. He went above and beyond even going as far as to recommend other great spots around the area to try out. The owner even checked in on our dining throughout the night to make sure we were 100% satisfied. Extremely charismatic and positive staff even during these difficult times. We will definitely be going back to this fantastic establishment."
0,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,4/11/2022,"This may be one of the greatest debates in the Boston north end area...who makes the best cannolis: Modern bakery or Mike's bakery? 

What better way to resolve this than to test them both. 

Mike's = sweeter filling, softer shell, larger cannolis (between the two), and an array of options. Oh my the OPTIONS! Chocolate, chocolate dipped, chocolate chip, espresso, chocolate drizzled, sweet cream, Oreo, lemoncello, plain, pistachio, the list goes on and on and on. And on and on and on. The one we absolutely had to get was the chocolate chip, because our family was over at Modern pastry grabbing that as well for a taste-off. The line was easily 100 people deep, circling around the block. I will say it went a lot faster than I was expecting, but as we entered Mike's pastry we realized there were eight employees running around filling pastry boxes at Godspeed. Each cannoli was $5 and we got four: ricotta, chocolate chip, chocolate dipped and espresso, and a slice of tiramisu because that's my favorite dessert of all time. Let's not discuss the fact that 30 minutes before this, we had a huge Italian meal at Dolce Vita and ended the meal with a tiramisu...

Modern = equally long line, which is why we split parties, slightly smaller cannoli and a harder pastry shell (less flaky), also $5/ea. 

Cutting both Modern and Mike's cannolis was a challenge in it of itself. Cannolis aren't meant to be cut with a dull butter knife, but we had to find a location for where we could taste test and next-door to Mike's pastry sat a little coffee café. Three lattes and two cappuccinos later, one tiny 2-person top table surrounded by 5 chairs, one dull butter knife and two boxes of cannolis later, we were ready to begin the competition.

Final tally = 2 votes for Mike's, 2 votes for Modern, 1 party liked them equally. I chose modern in the end because the filling was less sweet, and the less sweet for me the better. I felt the filling matched with the harder pastry shell made for the perfect combination. 

I must say both were absolutely fantastic. I have never been a fan of cannolis so this was a great competition for me because I had no expectations.

1,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,3/30/2022,"Well if these quite literally aren't the freshest cannolis in town...! Filled to order. The line is long for that reason, but it's totally worth it. I don't consider myself a cannoli expert by any means, but the evening I went we did a little cannoli tour of the north end, and this was really damn good. 

I was full, too full to try other treats, but I still had the bare minimum and split a cannoli. And yes, it was worth having to unbutton my pants afterward. 
If that doesn't speak to you, move along."
2,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,3/22/2022,"If you're in Boston, then Modern Pastry must be on your to go list. They're famous for their cannolis!! 

I got 3 plain shell cannolis, each filled with different fillings: traditional ricotta, chocolate, and vanilla. Each bite into the cannoli did not disappoint. The shell was crunchy BUT not hard to bite into. The fillings were so creamy but not overly sweet! 

The shop carries other desserts as well and I can't wait to go back to try them all."
3,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,2/26/2022,"Best cannoli tour in Boston has to include this little shop. 

We came here for a cannoli test after our stop at Mike's. There was a very short line here on a weeknight. The cannoli here is slightly cheaper than Mike's but also the size is smaller. They also only take cash. 

They do have a variety of sweets in addition to cannolis. We just got one of the plain ones to try and it was very authentic and traditional. Definitely not as sweet and not as big. Very different style than the ones at Mike's. 

Definitely must try if you are in the Boston area."
4,Modern Pastry Shop,3 star rating,1/1/2022,"Hopping on the top cannolis comparison train, we decided to check Modern out after having Mike's.

The bakery inside was comfortable, with warm Christmas vibes and even a dine-in area. The menu was slightly more personable, with the option to customize your shells, inside filling, and toppings. We ordered a Pistachio Cannoli ($5) and a Chocolate Dipped Cannoli with no toppings ($5), both with Traditional Ricotta. Toppings and non-plain shells were an extra charge.

Personally, I prefer the smaller size of the cannolis here over Mike's. The pistachio here were also actual pieces instead of diced up ones, resulting in a stronger nutty flavor if you prefer that. The ricotta filling was also not as sweet as Mike's which I liked, but it wasn't as creamy. Worst of all, the shell was not good! It was like a dry thick cracker, and I don't want no cracker. It tasted not fresh at all in my opinion and its stale texture got in the way of the otherwise yummy filling. The chocolate dipped definitely saves the shell. 

I thought the competition between the two would come close, but I prefer Mike's more for their cannolis."
5,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,12/19/2021,"11/2021

Since I was in Boston I had to try this local favorite bakery.  

Street parking /no private lot 

The line was out the door but it was one line past all the pastries so I was able to see what I wanted to buy

I picked up a bunch of items and sampled some in the hotel. My favorite was the strawberry shortcake.  It was so good I returned the same night to bring some
More home.  

Ill definitely be back."
6,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,3/2/2022,"This was my second time back in Boston and with my husband so I wanted to get him some cannolis since it's his childhood favorite dessert. 

We were going to check out Mike's but the timing didn't work out, so we found Modern Pastry Shop. I suppose it was meant to be since my husband couldn't stop raving about the cannoli. The shop itself is a very cute cafe filled with a large mix of Italian goodies. They did have a smaller selection of cannolis BUT with much more pastry items. The overall shop feels more warm and authentic as if you've stepped back into your Italian grandmother's kitchen."
7,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,12/8/2021,"When in Boston you have to get your fill of Cannolis. I was on my way to the other establishment but I noticed Modern Pastry Shop since it was only a few steps away.

I ordered my cannoli and grabbed a cup of coffee to complement my fix. The staff is supper friendly and it is family owned so what else can you ask for. If you wanted to dine in there are some tables for you to sit and hangout and check out the crowd walking outside.

I am very happy with my order, simple fast and fresh.
When in Boston I will surely make this place my 1st stop."
8,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,4/10/2022,Sooo delicious and overshadowed by the more touristy Mike's.  Highly excellent pasteries. Leave lots of time if a holiday is approaching.  Call ahead to reserve or special order.
9,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,2/26/2022,"It was awhile wait and they actually have a sign to line up.  Line moves very fast. 

I loved the mini whipped cream. The perfect size and just enough.  Whipped is light which I preferred.   My son had the custard and he ate it all by himself. 

We been to Bova and Mike's and I think Mordern has it for us."
10,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,12/13/2021,"fyi: Cash Only.

This is a cute little bakery in the north end.
Walking in it's so warm, you're greeted with an array of desserts and laterite's from french macarons to pitzelles. But of course the cannoli is a must.
The cannoli shell is crunchy and fried. The ricotta filling is cool and the pistachios add a nice crunch.
A favorite for a reason."
11,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,11/17/2021,"We had to give this place a try because we only go to Mike's.  We all agree Mike's has better cannoli. HOWEVER, we thought the torrone, pistachio macaroons, and chocolate dipped pizzelle were phenomenal! 

Looks like we will be going to both bakeries from now on."
12,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,4/8/2022,"Way better cannolis then Mikes bc they fill them right then and there so it has the best chance of being eaten as fresh as possible. Beware of this places staff too though bc like Mikes these ppl aren't always very friendly simply due to servicing so many customers at once however they are, in my opinion, a lot more kind then Mikes (still love them too just bc I love pistachio macarons lol)"
13,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,11/8/2021,"Modern Pastry Shop is one of those places you are supposed to check out for their cannoli, but they also have a vast selection of other baked goods. On a Sunday, I saw a very long line out the door in the evening and thought I would try to check them out the next day, Monday. It had rained that day and so I was hoping the rain and a week day would have less of a crowd. I was right, because a little before 6:30 pm, there was only one other person ahead of me.

When I came in, I was greeted by an employee behind the counter and then waited my turn to be helped. I ended up purchasing:

Plain Shell w/ Vanilla Custard, $4- I liked the simplicity of this cannoli with the crisp shell and yellow vanilla custard. It was sweet but not overly sweet. The shell was not soggy and was in a delicious harmony with the vanilla custard.

Plain Shell w/ Ricotta, $4- This cannoli shell was also crisp and was not soggy, even though this cannoli was consumed 2 days after it was purchased. I liked the ricotta filling, which I think is my favorite over the vanilla custard.
-------------------
(Total= $8)

Please note that this place is CASH ONLY.

When asked if I wanted powdered sugar topping my order (free of charge if you wish to have it added), I declined and am glad I did because I thought it was perfect as is.

Because Modern Pastry rivals Mike's Pastry (which is not too far from here), I ended up trying a few of their cannoli the same time I consumed Modern. To be honest, I think I prefer Modern Pastry over Mike's because of their crisp cannoli shell and their fillings not so overly sweet and decadent. Although Mike's Pastry cannoli filling is thicker, which I like but I think I like the flavors of Modern Pastry more.

You can choose one of four cannoli shells (plain, chocolate dipped, chocolate covered and a mini version), the filling (ricotta, vanilla custard, chocolate custard, whipped cream) and topping (chocolate chips, pistachio, almonds). The toppings are $0.50 each if you wish to add it.

The employee that was helping me was very sweet and friendly. She seemed to genuinely like her job (she had told me she is new, but I am not sure how long she has been working here).

I really liked Modern Pastry and would come back here not only for their cannoli but also would want to try some of their other baked desserts. Please note that you can make an order online and go right to the counter to pick up your order but unfortunately cannoli are not available to be purchased online."
14,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,12/9/2021,"Worth it? Yes
Repeat? Yes

CASH ONLY!
Don't be that person that stands in line for 25 minutes and freak out when it's cash only.

One of the two most popular pastry/cannoli spots in North End. Can't go wrong with either tbh.

The lobster tail is ginormous and definitely worth a try. 

Cannolis can be had in three different shells and flavors."
15,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,1/31/2022,"I came here on Thanksgiving morning and there was no line!! I was so surprised because I always see this place with a line around the corner. This was also my first time trying Modern Pastry so I was even more excited.

Cannolis - I thought they were great! I got the small version and actually really liked the cream to shell ratio. I also added pistachios on the outside and it was the BEST idea. The pistachios are toasted so they add so much texture and flavor! 

Macarons - I was a little more mixed on this one. I got 3 and felt that they were not very consistent. One of them was significantly more stale than the other 2 that I got, maybe I just chose an unpopular flavor and that macaron was leftover from the previous day. Wasn't too happy about that, but the other 2 I got were good. They are a pretty fluffy macarons that you can definitely tell are homemade, which was nice. The pistachio one tasted a little too artificial for me. The peanut butter and jelly one was actually my favorite!"
16,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,11/29/2021,"I'm on team modern pastry over mike's for their cannolis (controversial, I know!) Modern Pastry Shop has a really homey, authentic feel to it and is always bustling with customers. Their cannolis are relatively cheap but are still rich and creamy, and I love that they have chocolate dipped and mini options. They're also filled on the spot so the crust won't get soggy! 

I also highly recommend their Italian cookies. I frankly have no idea what I got, I just asked for the employee's recommendation. The chocolate covered shortbread cookies were my favorite. The rainbow cookies are great for almond lovers. I also loved their black and whites -- creamy and cakey to the max. 

A must try when you're in the north end! Especially if you're not into waiting 30 min in the cold across the street!"
17,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,3/19/2022,"Stopped by here on our way to dinner! We got the ricotta cheese pie, cannoli w/ricotta and chocolate chips, and the key lime tart. I initially came here for the cannolis, but I have to say my favorite was probably the key lime tart. Don't get me wrong. They were all really delicious and had the perfect level of sweetness, but the key lime tart was just something I was not expecting. This place is a must if you're in the area.

I actually prefer this place over Mike's because the cannoli filling is not as sweet. Also, the shell is slightly smaller, so when you get into the middle of the cannoli, you get a good ratio of ricotta to cannoli shell instead of just all ricotta."
18,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,10/18/2021,"I'll admit it: I prefer Modern to Mike's. Not just for cannoli, but for pretty much everything.

Besides the cannoli, Modern also has some of the best biscotti I've I've ever had AND the carrot cake I recently ordered from them earned rave reviews - including from those who usually can't stand carrot cake. The carrot cake I ordered was actually the birthday cake for my mother's birthday weekend in Boston. I had tried to convince my best friend (who had picked us up at the airport earlier that night) not to bother driving in the North End (he had never been in the neighborhood), and that it would instead be fine for us - or even just me - to call an Uber and go over to pick up the order (which I had pre-ordered online and already paid for). Instead, he said he was happy to drive (rest assured that after doing so he realized why I had recommended against it, haha)...

... cut to when we actually got to the North End and I was giving him directions for where to go in order to get around the throngs of people and close to Modern. Of course, when we got out in front of the place there was nowhere to park, so I told him I'd jump out, go in to grab the order, and he could go around the block. By the time he got back (which, c'mon... it's the North End at dinnertime, so it's going to take some time to maneuver around the people and one way streets), I'd be done and waiting for him. 

I hopped out, walked across the street and into the store, bypassed the ordering line (bless you, pre-ordering option), and went straight to the counter. Once I gave them my name, a super helpful employee went out to the back, promptly brought my order out, and asked if I wanted to check the cake. I did, and it looked lovely... so the employee quickly tied the box back up with the packaging string and handed that box, as well as my order of a dozen biscotti, to me. With that, I was on my way! I went back outside the store, saw my friend's car just a bit down the street, crossed the road, and hopped back into his car. :) Of course, he gave me a chuckle when he realized my warnings about trying to drive around the North End were accurate... but hey, it's always an adventure, amirite?

TL;DR  Delicious pastries and baked goods of all kinds. I've waited in line (worth it) but have always had great luck with their pre-ordering options too. Pleasant and helpful staff as well (which can be in contrast to Mike's, where I've frequently had some less pleasant interactions). Always great to come back!"

I got the chocolate covered plain shell with the regular filling and chocolate chips. The inside was creamy and had a nice cheesy flavor without being too overwhelming. The shell to filling ratio was just right and I got the perfect bite of chocolate, cream, and shell each time. 

My friends also thought their's was good and we would all recommend Modern."
20,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,4/6/2022,I don't think this place is in need of any advertisement. Thank you for doing what you do best - bring people heavenly joy of eating good pastry!
21,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,10/9/2021,"Lines out the door by 5 pm as people crowd this shop after work. It's an Italian pastry/desserts shop located in the Little Italy district of Boston. Tucked amidst the dozens of Italian restaurants, deli shops, and other fun Italian places, this one is a must if you're on the hunt for best Cannoli in Boston. We got the key lime tart, the ricotta pie and cannoli.
 
Key Lime pie was excellent; a bright and tart concoction that was well set. It was baked into the crust also super well as well.
 
Ricotta pie; first time I had ever had one. Reminded me more of a thick nuttier leaner version of cheesecake. Not too sweet, just felt thick.
 
Cannoli; one of the best. They fill it on the spot rather than have the ricotta soak through the outer shell. We had ours dipped with chocolate chip and pistachio. Definitely get the ricotta filling to keep this traditional."
22,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,10/15/2021,"At 2PM there was a line of about 10 people in front of us. They sure do have a very large selection of pastries all around. The staff is very friendly and so efficient. They have a coffee bar as well, but we didn't try it. 

We opted for a limoncello pastry and a traditional ricotta cannoli. Limoncello pastry was soooo moist and wonderful, it is a must try. The cannoli was great, but I am coming to an acceptance that with all the various cannolis that I have tried, I prefer other desserts...

Definitely need to come back and try other pastrieS...."
23,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,9/17/2021,"Yea you may have a line but who cares. All the locals know to come here and a lot of their stuff is also the deserts at a few places in the area.

Treat yourself to some cannoli and you can pick your shell, filling and  etc.

Get cannoli, get some cookies.. the staff is working hard and they are OLD SKOOL. 

CASH ONLY 

Ciao!"
24,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,1/22/2022,"My pre-trip research told me that Mike's is for toursits while Modern is for locals - not sure if this is true exactly, but we went ahead and tried Modern to see what was up! We were big fans of the cannoli shells and generous amount of chocolate chips, but we felt the ricotta filling was on the plain side. We appreciated that they had a small seating area so we could try our treats fresh instead of treking back to our hotel in the freezing cold before digging in."
25,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,9/26/2021,"The selection here is HUGE and everything looks delicious. Not sure how you can only visit one time... there is just too much to try! Since I am visiting Boston for the first time, I tried a cannoli and it was great as expected. My boyfriend tried the peanut butter cupcake and LOVED it. 

Even if the line is long, it goes fast - you should consider waiting, it is worth it!"
26,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,10/18/2021,"When in Boston, go to Modern. It's a must. Yep, have your order ready and your cash in hand. It's a fast-paced process so don't be scared of a line out the door. Pick up a few cookies, pastries, and don't dare skip out on the cannolis. I am counting down to the next one I get at the end of the month. 

Grab one and go eat it in Paul Revere Park just a short walk away. It's my tradition but it can be yours now too! Pistachio traditional cannoli for me, please."
27,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,9/7/2021,"A must visit pastry shop in North end and more local (less touristy) than Mike's Pastry shop. Visit this place instead! 

There cannolis are Deeeee-lish-ous! What's really cool about this place is that they let you customize each cannoli: the shell, the dipping, and the filling! 

I recommend the chocolate dipped pistachio cannoli with vanilla custard  wow the fresh flavors are out of this world! Each of their pastries were also well done."
28,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,4/6/2022,"Everything you've read about the service is probably accurate - straight-faced, no-nonsense, these folks are deathly serious about their pastry, and are a bit unimpressed with the mere mortals coming through their doors, but their pastries - my Lord - these are the pastries you eat in your dreams.  If Prometheus dared climb Mt Olympus to bring us pastry, this is the pastry he'd bring.  100% certain their standards meet or exceed anything you could find in Europe - which is a lot to say in North America.  God bless these people - for them, pastry is no laughing matter."
29,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,8/22/2021,"Came into North End hearing that it was THE place to get cannolis, so we stopped by Modern Pastry Shop.

The way they do cannolis is mix and match - you can choose the outside, the filling, and the topping. 

We got the chocolate-dipped cannoli with ricotta and pistachios, and I thought it was great! Not too sweet but still well-flavored. I would recommend it for sure! We tried some other cannolis in the area but this was my favorite ;)

We didn't try their other desserts but those also looked delicious!

The line is long but well-worth the wait. The workers are also all super nice :) Would recommend!!"
30,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,7/20/2021,"Holy cannoli! This is definitely the holy grail of cannolis. Where I am from, cannolis are these gross stuffed things filled with some sort of cream cheese filling. Modern pastry definitely does not have those!

I was told from a local; go to modern pastry. The cannolis are the best around and this is where all the locals go.

You can choose what type of shell you get, the filling and if you want any toppings. I got the classic shell, with the classic ricotta filing with pistachios. The ricotta filling was so light and delicious, while the pistachios gave it a great crunch and flavor. If all cannolis were created like these ones, I think I would be eating them very often."
31,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,9/3/2021,"A must try in the North End! There are plenty of beautiful pastries when you walk in and they all sound very delicious and worthwhile to try but we mainly came here to try their famous CANNOLI. I like how they give you options to customize it such as the kind of shell, filling, and toppings so you know they make it for you on the spot to avoid soggy shells. After trying a few cannolis around the area, this one is still my favorite. What made Modern stand out was that the ricotta filling was not overly sweet. I appreciate its mildness so I can really taste more of the ricotta itself rather than pure sugar.

They have a nice seating area which is a plus if you want to eat your cannoli ASAP for max freshness :)"
32,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,7/16/2021,"It's been food jackpot me for quite a while and this is yet another winning place.  This as a uggested by our doorman for good pastries and cakes while in North end.  

All I can say is that one visit is not enough here.  I wanted to buy and taste everything.  Lots of cakes, macarons, many varieties of fresh cannolis with different fillings to choose from, and FRESHLY made torrone.  Never had it fresh, always bought it prepackaged in a box at my local Italian grocer.  What a difference fresh made makes. I'll never go back to prepackaged torrone.  

There is a small area within the pastry shop with several cafe tables and chairs, very quaint.  Perfect place to grab a coffee and a pastry or two or three, and sit.  

Apparently there is also a restaurant downstairs where they were doing a pizza tasting. If I had known about the restaurant before eating so many pastries I would have made my way to that pizza tasting event!  Next time for sure."
33,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,4/3/2022,"Oh man, these pastries are too good. I had the chocolate dipped pizzelle and a few pistachio cookies. Pizzelle was nice and chewy with rich chocolate. Chocolate was not overly sweet. Loved it. Pistachio cookies were the best I've had. The flavor and texture were spot on. Can't wait to get back."
34,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,11/7/2021,Now to try modern pastries! I love this bakery they have a little bit for everyone and there cannolis are to die for! Remember this place is CASH ONLY. The likes can be out the door but moves quickly.
35,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,12/10/2021,"It's just a good old fashioned bakery. Extremely crowded. Nothing stands out as far as pastry. If you're in the neighborhood, I'd recommend the panettone pastry. There are a few tables and a bar downstairs but I'd recommend taking it to go."
36,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,5/26/2021,"After the disappointing visit to Mike's Pastry, I decided to try their rival across the street just a few stores down. 

This place has long lines the same as Mike's and a giant display cases of pastries and sweets. I decided on a slice of tiramisu and also a Napoleon.

I can say this place beats Mike's hands down in terms of flavor. The sweetness is more balanced and just in general easier on the palate. I was able to finish both items in one sitting. Excellent!!"
37,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,8/2/2021,"Not having learned my lesson after waiting in line 40 minutes for a cannoli, I then made my way to Modern Pastry. 

Again the line went around the block. But it was a nice crisp, summer evening and the lively chatter of patrons waiting patiently in line, was a siren song that could not be ignored. I dragged my awestruck hubby, who was exclaiming 'you want to get what now?!' and we lined up to get my second set of cannolis for the evening.  I mean what else were we going to do at 10:30pm after 9+ hours of driving up to Boston ? Rest? Sleep? Why would we do that? 

This time the choice was simpler, choose a shell, a filling and a topping. I knew what I wanted and was ready to order - Plain shell, plain ricotta, pistachio topping for my cannoli.  I was taken straight to the cashier to give my order and in 10 minutes I had my second box of cannoli and tiramisu treats.
Lovely crispy shell, creamy ricotta filling with lots of pistachio. This cannoli had bigger pistachio pieces, not crushed! It was just as good as Mike's pastry with a slight difference in taste, smaller size and 50 cents cheaper.  The tiramisu was also as good, though I liked the coffee flavor of Modern's a little more.   Would definitely go back"
38,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,11/2/2021,"The regular ricotta was superb, flaky yet balanced and just the right sweet, texture and flavor. Their Italian cookies were amazing too, slightly chewy and crunchy and prepackaged well (as compared to another place we went to, where things were left in the open- would've been fine if there weren't flies in the air). The decaf double espresso was shockingly good. Some limited seating. So glad we went. I miss good Italian bakeries like this when I lived in NYC (I now
Live in California) and this place really helped scratch that itch."
39,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,11/9/2021,"Modern Pastry makes me feel like most things are not impossible. It would be amiss not to amass a morsel of their marvelous, yet meticulous selection that they masterfully muster up the courage to mess the game of all who must try. Most of all, it is a reminder of the matter of fact that we still live in a pandemic, which mutters a mumbling cry of mistaken identity that Mike's is the more superior of the two, which is a complete misnomer.

My take on this majestic shop in Massachusetts is one that I may take away when I leave to return to Manhattan four days from now. Honestly, I missed this spot when I was here last, a misstep I promised to avoid this time around.

I might return here, as long as I have the money and means to maximize the return here, not minimize it, as to not feel meek as I am too excited for another makeshift return to Modern Pastry. For thankfully, a little motherly pastry or two can certainly mend a broken heart."
40,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,7/5/2021,"Compared to Mike's, Modern Pastry Shop feels more like a traditional old-school Italian bakery with intricate Italian pastries and feels less like an industrial mass-manufacturing machine churning out giant-sized cannolis.

I got a cassatine, which is kinda like an Italian version of a Swedish Princess Cake - there's a thin green marzipan layer on the outside that enrobes cherry-flavored, rum-soaked sponge cake layers that has ricotta filling and mini chocolate chips studded in it. It's a textural delight and worth the $5. Cash only!"
41,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,11/21/2021,These cannolis are perfection. Crunchy on the exterior balanced with the right amount of filling which tasted oh so fresh. Each bite reminded me of Italy & these cannolis are the next best thing! Tried Modern Pastry and Mikes and our group liked Modern more. Came here around 1pm and there was no line.
42,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,1/15/2022,Very good pastry! Like the ability to customize cannoli! Service tends to be good and quick too
43,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,3/27/2021,"Out of any Italian pastry, hubs was feeling for a Cannoli. We bypassed Mike's Pastry because it practically looked like people were elbow-to-elbow waiting for pastries. I wanted no part of that. Walked further on Hanover St and in comes Modern. 

I'm not a cannoli expert, but these are super fresh I thought- and filled on the spot as opposed to sitting on shelves for hours- maybe days. I'd gotten hubs a plain 'Traditional' cannoli while I got the Chocolate-dipped, Almond topping kind- which were both filled to the brim with the freshest, sweetest ricotta mixture you can imagine. 

Hubs liked his decaf Cappuccino- but was thrown off by the Cocoa powder on it- as he has always gotten his cappuccinos with cinnamon powder on it already......not cocoa. Also, the guy preparing the cappuccino doesn't ask whether you want it or not. Odd. Space almost resembles a U-shape design and there's so much going on all their pastry counters- I couldn't keep up! But other than that cappuccino slip, Cannoli here are off the charts."
44,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,1/11/2022,"I heard this is where the locals go. Apparently, only tourists go to mikes. O_O I liked modern more because it was less sweet & smaller - cream to cone portion was better to me"
45,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,4/5/2022,"I love Modern :)   I like Mikes, I got nothing bad to say about them, but something about Modern just makes them a bit more to my taste.  :)  Great service, everyone super friendly, just love this place."
46,Modern Pastry Shop,3 star rating,11/2/2021,"- good pastries
- cash only
- cannolis tasted fresh and not mass produced
  I didn't even know what a mass produced cannoli tasted like
- may favorite is ricotta
- cakes were fresh
  caked last three days in the fridge before getting too hard to enjoy"
47,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,12/28/2021,I decided to get cannolis from both here and Mike's. These are slightly smaller. Both are fantastic. You can't go wrong with either.
48,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,2/18/2022,"Lobster Tails are incredible. The line moves quickly no matter how long it is. They fill the lobster tails as you order them, sprinkle with powdered sugar and wrap in a box with twine. It's CASH ONLY as almost all the places in the north end are. It would be hard to walk around and not notice all the cash only signs in the window. I have carried many a lobster tail back to the bus station and on the bus back to New Hampshire. I don't really like cannolis so I can't speak to those, but a lobster tail is about as big as your head and worth the trip for the wow factor."
49,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,12/31/2021,"I've tried many cannolis in Little Italy in NYC and got this recommendation from a friend that despite being a local, he would still recommend going here. Every tourist are getting boxes of this and from Mike's Pastry down Hanover St. with long lines at both cannoli spots. In terms of the cannoli, it was a petite one, but a very good one overall with its delicate shell and light cannoli cream. Even though I felt Mike's was better, their one was close to beating out, as their cream was light and not as heavy as Mike's. Plus, their line organization and customer service was better than at Mike's. Overall, I would recommend this over any cannoli in NYC."
50,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,8/21/2021,"A must stop for anyone that is visiting Boston. They have so many pasties, pies, cookies and cakes to choose from. Unlike so many other dessert places, they give you the option of picking your own cannoli. You choose the shell, the filling the toppings and the flavor, all to what you want. I loved the cheesecake, OMG it was sooo creamy and smooth."
51,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,10/5/2021,"Being gluten free can be less than stellar when traveling. I wanted to try a cannoli while in Boston and on my search for them, this place popped up. So, off we went to sate my need for a sweet treat. When we arrived, there was a line, which moved quickly enough. The person who helped me was very nice. I got a gluten free traditional ricotta cannoli. It came in a cute little box with yarn tied around it. The filling was binge worthy. This was my first cannoli ever, and I'd definitely eat many more!"
52,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,4/14/2021,"This cash only establishment with a long history in Boston was a perfect dessert  stop. 
We decided to go here because they had seating and we wanted to enjoy our sweets. Everything they have make your  mouth water! I had one of their signature cannolis, plain  was just perfect. I also ordered some macaroons to go, and I cannot tell you how delicious they were and I had wish I had ordered more. The pistachio flavor was phenomenal. Some may say that you're a traitor if you visit modern instead of Mike's butI enjoyed sitting with my sweets."
53,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,2/8/2022,"Delicious sweets, pastries, and cannolis. Cannolis are very rich - you get to pick the shell and filling. Cash only."

56,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,11/1/2021,"I definitely preferred Modern pastry over Mikes down the street but that might also be due to the fact that these are smaller in size and I am not a fan of the ricotta stuffing that I got at Mikes. 

But as a true dessert person and tourist I would say split up and get both on your trip to north end!"
57,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,8/30/2021,"I'm super impressed at how they keep their line moving. Although the line looked daunting, we didn't wait very long and by the time we got up to the window, it provided ample time for me to take in all desserts on display and figure out what I wanted to order! 

We REALLY enjoyed the canolis and loved that they are freshly filled and you can mix and match filling/topping/etc. Their tiramisu is also light and fluffy and PERFECT!"
58,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,8/12/2021,"Great cannolis. We had the pistachio cannoli, had whole pistachios what a great touch. The cannoli shell was crisp. The macaroons were very flavorful also. Great pastry, and definitely a must try when in Boston"

60,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,7/16/2021,"don't look at this post if you are hungry !! 
Mama Mia!   Italian Pastries at Modern Pastry Shop in Boston.    We put a dent into the cases and cases of baked goods.   We tried PLimoncello Cake, Chocolate Mousse Cake, Italian Cookies, Almond Macaroons, Amaretto puff, canoli with custard and chocolate covered strawberries.    all were or are still amazing as we are grazing thru them."
61,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,8/6/2021,"The cakes here are delicious!!! I love tiramisu and Modern does a solid job with espresso soaked on the bottom and light marscapone cream topping. 

The limoncello was also fantastic. Truly like a frozen lemonade in a cake form. The lemon mousse was light with delicious sponge in between.

I would definitely return here!!"
62,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,11/7/2021,"I come here for the cannoli, and left with more. This place is old school cash only. Selling cookies by the pound. 1/2 pound of cookies and cannolis in two different boxes beautifully wrapped to take home. Staff was very friendly. The whole experience is worth the wait."
63,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,11/7/2021,When in the North-end you need to decide which side of the street you are going to visit for pastries.  Modern or Mikes. The debate will forever rage on but the locals will more than likely tell you Modern. Very fresh products and a friendly staff. Only part of Modern I don't like is the CASH ONLY aspect. It honestly impacts my ability to buy more for home as I barely ever carry much cash.
64,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,7/6/2021,"Waited in line for about 15 minutes on a weekend - not bad at all. It was so enticing looking at all the delicious pastries while waiting in line. I ultimately decided on a large peanut butter cup and a GF chocolate chip cannoli. The staff was fast without rushing us, and packed our goods up nicely. That didn't matter much though, since I ate both of them within 15 minutes of leaving. Honestly chose this spot over Mike's due to their gluten free options!! It was worth the wait. Whenever I come back to the North End, I'll come here!"
65,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"I've tried the ""other"" pastry shop so we decided to wait in line to give this one a try. The store only accepts Cash so be prepared but the prices and reasonable and the line moved quick. The red velvet cupcake and the key lime tart were exceptional, the chocolate custard cannoli was also very good. The service was efficient and I thought it was a perfect way to end a long day of walking around Boston. For sure will return for the Boston cream cupcake!"
66,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,12/31/2020,"So our favorite cannoli place was closed for the week. Since we were in the area especially for the cannolis we decided to give Modern Pastry a try. There were no lines and we moved right to order. We got chocolate dipped and a plain shell one with ricotta cheese + chocolate chips filling. Best part about Modern is you can customize the shell and the filling. 
This was our first time trying Modern pastry after going to Mike's for ages. Modern Pastry didn't disappoint, it is a delicious cannoli, slightly smaller than Mike's. I am probably in the minority when I say I like Mike's ricotta filling better."
67,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,4/14/2021,"My sister in law lives in Boston and prefers this bakery over any other one. So we had to stop by and gets some sweet stuff. My favorite here is the sunrise dessert.  It was so good. I also liked the Key Lime Tart that was also good, but not my favorite. The line here was out the door and it did move a bit slower, but I can say that it was worth the wait."
68,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,4/2/2022,Better of the available bakeries in Boston.  I particularly like Nouget.

70,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"AMAZING doesn't even begin to describe the cannoli I ate. Being from the Midwest i genuinely didn't think I was a cannoli fan. I was sooooo wrong!!!  

These cannolis were one of the most delicious baked items I've ever eaten. 

My favorite was the original with vanilla cream and almonds."
71,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,10/6/2020,"Came here when I saw the line for Mike's pastry shop was absurdly long. Why isn't there just as much hype for Modern Pastry compared to Mike's?

I understand Modern isn't really well known for its cannolis, but I couldn't find a reason not to like the cannolis that were made here at Modern. I got two cannolis - both plain shell with vanilla custard and their ricotta custard with a light dash of sugar. Cannolis were made to order as one of the bakers filled the cannolis on the spot. Very tasty! not too sweet and you can taste the ricotta richness in each bite. 

Staff was friendly, nice, and attentive. Love the ambiance that's being created here since it doesn't feel as touristy as Mike's and it feels like a neighborhood staple for locals who just want to have a cup of coffee, eat some pastries, and chill. 

There's a huge expansive menu and many other options to try. Since I was craving for cannolis, I will save my stomach for Modern's other incredibly pretty offerings for the next time I am there!"
72,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,11/6/2021,Across the street from Mike's pastry and isn't as crowded which is great. I honestly think their desserts/pastries are better than Mike's. The cakes here are the highlight.
73,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,4/8/2021,"We were told that we had to try Mikes & Modern. Modern was just as amazing as Mikes! We also got coffee & tiramisu here with our cannolis. Bravo! It was less packed than Mikes & had more options, we could even sit down. But both are a must try when in Boston!"
74,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,2/26/2022,"Delicious, delicious, desserts! Highly recommend Bomba Cake and limoncello cake. And of course you can never go wrong with a cannoli!"
75,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,9/4/2020,"Amazing cannolis!!! Found this place randomly on a impromptu day trip to Boston. 

Beware of the lines and it's cash only. We waited in line to only to find out it was cash only and e only had enough cash for one cannoli each. It was soooo good that we had to go to the bank to get more cash and waited in line again to take some home. 
The lines are long but the staff is super professional and keep the lines moving efficiently. Very friendly service.

They have a lot of gluten free options. It was the first time I had a cannoli in years! I'm so thankful for the options."
76,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,3/2/2021,"We were initially brought here as part of our Boston Pizza Tour. They took us to the basement bar for pizza and we finished the night with Cannoli from Modern. As avid cannoli fans, we loved them and needed to come back. On our day of free-roaming around the North End, we made our way back to Modern. Make sure to get cash first because we made that mistake ourselves (I always find that annoying). This time around we tried some more items from the case and everything was great. Some people in my group bought a bunch of pizzelles to take home. Not my favorite but they are hardcore Italian and grew up making them at home. Surprisingly, they got them back to SC with minimal damage. We intended to go to Mike's to do the comparison, but by the time we made it back that way, the line was redic and we had already gorged on sweets. Maybe next time."
77,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,9/15/2021,"Got to say, we like the competitor across the street but this place is special.  The lobsta tail stuffed fresh when ordered was too die for.  We went back and a few other delicious things all of which were amazing."
78,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,9/11/2021,"Super long line even at 9:30 PM! We waited about 30-45 minutes. I do like they you can see the display cases as soon as you walk in to make your decision. The counter team was a little gruff (although, I do understand it's a hard job). The tiramisu was one of the best I've ever had. I'd stop back if I'm the area."
79,Modern Pastry Shop,1 star rating,1/16/2022,"Rude servers/people behind the counter. We walk in and sit down fully expecting to have coffee and pastries. Very rude and mean server comes up to us and asks are you gonna buy something or no before we even had the chance to sit down. We order, the pastries and coffee were sub-par and not very good. We left and went to mikes pastries down the street and were treated much better and it was a better bakery. Will not be back because of my experience just skip this place and go to mike's down the street."
80,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,12/17/2021,"We went here on a Sunday night around 7 PM. We got in line and they were maybe 15 people ahead of us. The weight and the anticipation is always too much for me. And, I love waiting in line and then looking at all of the delicious options because that makes it harder to decide. Since we were doing a taste test I had to limit the amount of things that I purchased. I got one large order of pixels, a traditional cannoli with ricotta filling and chocolate chips on the side, two multicolored red yellow green cookies and that's it. The person who got my order was super Duper nice and so friendly. I love the triple colored cookies, they are one of my favorites with the marzipan. They also have the bats pixels. I like their cannoli and I don't think it's the best in the city, however their lobster claws are and the next time I come backI will be getting that from here. There wasn't enough room in my stomach."

I had a fresh, crispy, and delicious cannoli! I will definitely return when I make it back to Boston!"
82,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,2/16/2022,"Awesome pastries! This place is always poppin as it debatably has the best pastries in the north end. Super classic, delicious, can't disappoint. In addition to their cannolis, their cakes are so good! Ordered a full size Tiramisu for a party and it was perfect."
83,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"I can't imagine that Mike's would be much better than Modern Pastry. Unbelievable cannolis, just make sure you go for the classic ricotta filling and not the vanilla custard, which was like taking a chunk out of a nice bag of C&H. The filling texture was perfect, not drying, not chunky, but still held itself in the pastry and off my pants. 

The pastries in the cases looked literally insane. I could see myself in the reflection of the Hostess cupcakes, however I could not see them being better than the cannolis. Never seen anything like it before, so clean and shiny it was like looking into a new Samsung TV or something. So pretty that not even an iPhone could do it a sprinkle of justice.

As I'm writing this I bump my 4 stars up to 5 because who the hell cares about vanilla custard in a cannoli. Come for the ricotta, stay for.... well, more ricotta."
84,Modern Pastry Shop,2 star rating,3/20/2022,"Going with two/2 stars because there was a help wanted sign. I went in looking for St. Joseph Zeppole--with yellow custard cream and cherries--lovely balance.  Most Italian American pastries make them the week of the holiday March 19.  I walked in and saw one female staffer speaking to a couple--I scanned the cases and did not see them.  There were folks at little tables so I walked down to the other end of the counter toward the cashier/young man.  The female staffer disappeared I guess to check on tables but the couple went around me and the cashier started to talk to them.  I saw the empty shells on the counter and I did not want to interrupt so I waited. He was not serving the couple they were just chatting but still I did not want to be rude--he did turn to me and asked if I need help. I asked for St. Joseph Zeppole--he did not hear/understand me.  I repeated. No luck. I said St. Joseph pastry and he shook his head. I gave up and walked back down the counter, the female staffer was back but ducked down and I figured she was pulling out pasty and decided to try my luck at Mike's (see also that review). Disappointing I did not find them but the other pastries did look good but they are definitely short handed."
85,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,4/30/2021,"This place is everything you imagine a traditional Italian bakery to be. Even though I read reviews that said cash only, I still forgot upon arrival. :) Good thing there was a Bank of America right across the street!  I ordered an Americano, a shot of Baileys and the Hostess cake and my bill was $14 total. I think that's great bang for my buck! Cake was sweet and delicious, gooey on the outside, and creamy on the inside. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Location was on an adorable street with many Italian restaurant's nearby. Thank you to the lady on my flight from Nashville who told me about this place."
86,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,4/28/2021,"Wanted to do the famous taste test between Modern and Mike's. The service at Modern's was way better. The staff here were SO friendly and helpful. Way more organized inside and it was the cutest shop. Way nicer insider with people sitting down drinking coffee and eating pastries for breakfast. I ordered the plain shell with ricotta, plain shell with chocolate chip and vanilla cream with pistachio. Ricotta with chocolate chip was the winner. Good portion size and the employee showed me the cannolis in the box before wrapping it up. Whereas the staff at Mike's, did not talk to me once besides telling me what my total was and had the cannolis wrapped without showing me. Great friendly service here at Modern's!"
87,Modern Pastry Shop,4 star rating,8/4/2021,"Walking around North end and wanted some post-sushi desserts. Modern is the go-to: no myriad cannoli flavors like Mike's, but higher quality classics and a shorter line.

Still a line out the door, as almost always, but went pretty quick. Ordered a chocolate-dipped vanilla cannoli with pistachios, a key lime tart, a Kahlua truffle, and a chocolate ganache. Total was around $16 I believe.

Cannoli was amazing as always, freshly piped and perfectly flavorful. Crisp shell and smooth cream. First time trying the other items, was very impressed by the key lime tart, sweet but not overpoweringly so, a mild tartness that adds to the profile. Kahlua truffle was good but tasted mostly like a dark chocolate truffle with hints of Kahlua at the bottom, would have enjoyed stronger flavor. The chocolate ganache was tasty but not quite up to expectations, as it was mostly chocolate mousse and not much ganache, maybe that's what it is (chocolate mousses sit next to them in the display container, maybe they just cover it in ganache)? Anyways, was looking for something more rich and got something more airy. Will look for chocolate d e n s i t y in another item.

Overall great taste, got to explore other items next time. Remember to bring cash!"
88,Modern Pastry Shop,5 star rating,1/5/2022,"I am 4th generation Boston family and now 5 generations.... I have been to Mikes, Bova, Modern pastries, Montillios, Whites Bakery, and many more ... Modern desserts niche is the better decadent pastries vs. cannoli focused like Mike's.
Modern has great cannolis and fresh stuffed on order, the chocolate mocha dessert was outstanding.  Modern has nice sitting area and better focused for a coffee or cappuccino and a sit down pastry... mike's had no sitting and geared to mass cannoli traffic. Only problem with Modern is you enter and ordering process poorly designed... then slow as too many cannoli options with nothing on display for cannolis as each is made to order? Slow process... Mike's is faster and cannolis all pre made and stacked on display to pick and far more options... but for a better other pastry ; then I go to Modern and their cannolis just as good and shell I preferred.  Now if I want the Holy grail best cannoli... I go to Bova and usually for their huge double size Florentine sticky chocolate shell... clearly my chosen best cannoli and only place with a Florentine shell I have seen ... size is double Mikes , Modern and higher price but worth
Pic from Modern's must have chocolate mocha pastry

It was SOOOOOOOOO good.

Yes it looks like a lobster shell.
Nicely hard and crunchy! 
Nicely layered to peel
The cream is not too sweet but wonderfully sweet enough. 
That is awesome discovery!!"
0,Whole Foods Market,5 star rating,8/20/2018,"This Whole Foods was close by the Museum of Fine arts! The 20 ounce Organic Tamari was priced at 6.99, which is the price I pay for a 10 ounce bottle at my local supermarket, so I was beyond thrilled! 
It looks a bit smaller than the usual Whole Foods I am used to, but they do have a decent range of vegan products and as such, I was able to find everything I needed and easily enough! 
The staff also was friendly when I asked for some help locating certain items.
It definitely served my purpose!"
1,Whole Foods Market,3 star rating,5/25/2021,"Lately there seems to be slippage in management quality at the Ctown Whole Foods at Bunker Hill Mall. Many basic items (eg., low fat cottage cheese, milks, pastas)  are not reliably stocked. Lots of empty spaces as product just isn't there. I now regularly anticipate not finding items and am considering shopping elsewhere even though I've been a loyal customer since this store opened. Too many personal shoppers fill multiple grocery bags on large wheeled carts, quickly clearing items off the shelves that aren't replenished in a timely manner for average shoppers. Very few WF employees are stocking shelves. I'm not sure exactly what the issue is, but the store has a feel of being in decline. So sad."
2,Whole Foods Market,1 star rating,12/10/2019,"Food in this place is getting worse. Mexican bar is cold and stale. The sandwiches are tasteless.
Never seen this level of horridness in a whole foods"
3,Whole Foods Market,2 star rating,4/2/2021,"As a 35 year Charlestown resident I was happy to see WF open here but it has never been near any other WF in so many ways. When they first opened most WF's would offer you a sample if you asked about a prepared food, never happened here and now that Amazon owns it, well
Nothing is free to sample. All deli and prepared foods are put away minimally 45 minutes before store closing and generally it's an hour before closing. I asked at another WF and was told they are paid after hours to clean up but here they can just walk out at closing, if not sooner. It's difficult to find any English speaking worker other than the register, bakery and flower shops. Now with COVID-19 they have less as far as selection and prepared foods is the same day after day, nothing new, no variety. I can leave this store with all prepared food put away and make the 7 minute ride to the Charles River WF and arrive 5 minutes before closing and everything is still out and people are helpful."
4,Whole Foods Market,2 star rating,9/10/2020,"Horrible!  As a recent transplant to the city from the burbs, I was pleased to find a WF in close proximity to where we now live.  That was until I actually went shopping there.  As a shopper that attempts to only purchase products without a bar-code on them, this is not the place for me.  The fruit flies are a clear indication of what is happening in the produce department.  Avocados so over ripe you could just open one up and have a nice drink of avocado, yuck!  Large tomatoes were in similar condition, the containers of grape and similar sized tomatoes had liquid in the bottom from the juice oozing out of the decaying tomatoes, along with the flies.

In general, many staple vegetables were simply not available, the same with a number of products I used to buy at WF.  Staff is nowhere to be found other that at the cash registers.

Overall the experience was extremely disappointing and this store gets a ""D"" in comparison to may others I have been in.

I will follow some of the other reviewers and try out Russo's in Watertown."

8,Whole Foods Market,1 star rating,9/25/2020,"So I experienced an extremely racist incident at this particular Whole Foods which I am not surprised as I have experienced similar incidents with other locations. However, my initial complaint here on YELP was reported by While Foods because this location wants everyone not to know how racist this Charlestown location is.  I watched as 2  cashiers, an Asian male and an White female , had themselves a conversation while I stood in line waiting to be checked out. They did this while looking right at me without a care in the world. Not until a white woman walked up beside me did they motion her over. So Whole Foods you can report my posting and experience all you like, but you cannot stop me from reporting your Charlestown location to BLM, local TV stations, the NAACP and all other resources where it is their mission to investigate racist experiences. Now, let's see you call Yelp about that! And many thanks to Yelp for supporting racism.  I will continue to post my experiences like it or not. Oh, and Whole Foods Charlestown, where is the Black representation on your management team? Report that! There is not 1 Black manager on your team. Why?  I'll tell you why , because this is a racist location where it is obviously believed , as with most businesses, that Black people should know there place as I should have when I was overlooked while waiting to check out. Report that to Yelp. Cheers!"

10,Whole Foods Market,1 star rating,2/19/2019,"This place is a joke. They use their location and arrogance to charge prices that they shouldn't be aloud to. I have been in a couple time and the selection isn't that vast, their bakery cookies are not good, mostly all hard and their attempt at the Italian rainbow cookies is comical. I paid $6.79 for a head of cabbage yesterday, that was the final straw. Often prices are marked up 150-200%. Plenty of other options in the area, I refuse to use it even for convenience at this point, it's unethical."
11,Whole Foods Market,2 star rating,5/19/2017,"I'm a regular Whole Foods shopper in a lot of different cities depending on my travel schedule.  Usually go to get fresh fruit, veggies, etc while on the road and enjoy grabbing healthy snacks and quick dinners or lunch for the quality, convenience, health conscience, etc. 

This store is small, the cashiers and staff are terribly rude. I've even talked to the supposed manager and he is oblivious to his surrounding and usually is outside smoking as is most of the staff.  You really have to wonder if these people are handling food after being outside smoking and not washing up afterword. 

Many times the shelves are out of stock and as others have mentioned check the expiration dates on all products as there is often expired food.  The store is also dirty and grimy looking, just not what you expect given the prices and other WF in the area that are much, much nicer and the staff are helpful and friendly. 

Even though this is closest WF to me, I drive to either the MGH or the Ink Block store because the stores are really nice, clean, staff are helpful and the cashiers are friendly. Just an extremely better experience all around.  Charlestown WF is just an overpriced, dirty, gross store.  

Surprised the corporate WF group hasn't stepped in to get this place cleaned up, better management, retrain employees and operational focused on customers."
12,Whole Foods Market,4 star rating,3/20/2017,Smaller WF compared to others in the area. Charlestown is just small in general though. Staff is friendly and there is plenty of parking.  Good selection of quality food.
13,Whole Foods Market,5 star rating,12/4/2015,"Expensive but extremely convenient and high quality if you're in the South End/Back Bay area. Definitely nicer than the one on Westland. Their 365 Organic store brand is pricy but I love their granola bars and soy milk. They also have a great selection of beauty products that I haven't been able to find at any department stores or convenience stores. 

What I really came here for though was the hot foods section. The Whole Foods on Westland had a very disappointing one (very small selection, not the freshest either), but I'm happy to say this one was everything I could have wanted it to be. IIRC it's $8.99/pound no matter what you get, so you can mix the cold and hot food, which a lot of other places won't let you do. 

The store itself was super clean, organized, and had plenty of friendly employees. You're definitely gonna burn money if you shop here (even if you only get the essentials), but the quality of everything is just so much higher, I feel as though its worth it to splurge once in a while at WF."
14,Whole Foods Market,3 star rating,8/28/2018,Salad bar is pathetic.  This grocery store is no longer a source for high quality foods.  It's middlebrow and uninspired.  Sad
15,Whole Foods Market,1 star rating,5/20/2016,"This is the worst Whole Foods I have ever been to. It is usually dirty and understocked. When you ask employees where you can find things, they never know, and they have to ask about 5 people before they can finally figure it out. The food bar is also really pretty gross - it looks like it comes from a Golden Corral-style buffet and it looks not fresh at all. Plus, you have to really push the cashiers to get the 5 cent refund for bringing your own bag. I use a giant purse and usually use that. Many cashiers won't deduct the 5 cents unless I bug them about it (and then they look annoyed) and others claim that I have to have another separate bag to get the 5 cent refund, which is completely stupid. I'm still using my own bag and not using the store bag. 

They're very successful pretty much because they're next to Bunker Hill, but if you can go to any other Whole Foods - then really, go to any other Whole Foods. 

I wouldn't call this place Whole Foods. I would call it Whole Paycheck (if you actually find what you're trying to get in the first place - good luck! Bring your kids. Everyone loves a good scavenger hunt)  Plus The Five Cents You Won't Get For Your Bag Discount Unless Your Really Advocate For Yourself, Not Because Five Cents Is So Very Important But Honestly, It's The Principle Of The Matter."
16,Whole Foods Market,2 star rating,8/18/2019,Sunday night - busy night and they have one person at the deli. Happens every week. Tonight particularly bad as the woman in front of me kept tasting everything. Finally had to leave after 10 minutes of being ignored.  1 person helping people and 2 others cleaning.  Get your deli meats elsewhere!
17,Whole Foods Market,3 star rating,10/19/2015,"I do some shopping here mainly because of the distance. I am close to this and Star Market and lets face it, this place has better stuff, generally! I am not a HUGE Whole Foods supporter simply because they overprice everything, and they can get away with it because we aren't in close proximity to Farmers Markets and Farms in the Boston area all too often, all year long.

The reality is, it is a place where you are going to spend an entire paycheck for hardly a week's worth of food. Occasionally I'll come for a few select things you can't find anywhere, and that is fine, but my aggravation is the the quality for the price. It is almost as though they spray paint their produce, as soon as I bring it home, it wilts immediately. I try hard to go to Wilson's Farm in Lexington when I want farm produce, and I spend the same money for 3 weeks worth of organic food. Hmm, geez, maybe the extra 30 min drive is worth it.

Regardless, this location is clean, the staff is polite and well informed, they're just doing their jobs and some quit well. I have no grievances with the people there, just the company's ridiculous need to overprice food that should be readily available to human beings. The parking lot is kind of a mess, it shares a lot with all of the other stores there, if you go during rush hour, you're pretty much stuck there! Also, open up a liquor section, it would accommodate tons of people in that area, trust me."
18,Whole Foods Market,4 star rating,7/28/2018,"Typical Whole Foods and a good hot food bar. Not sure if it's just the items that I usually go for but they seem to be a little more expensive here than in Somerville. Charlestown is really nice, but this is the only grocery store in it and it would be cool to have some more affordable options as well."
19,Whole Foods Market,4 star rating,8/15/2015,"What can I say that already hasn't been said for 4 stars? This is what a Whole Foods should be. 'Nuff said.

20,Whole Foods Market,5 star rating,4/19/2017,"The most amazing thing just happened at my local Whole Foods...I bought some truffle oil, then realized that it was a treat I should do without at this time. I went to customer service and was asked why I wanted to return it ( I bought other stuff). When I explained, I was asked if I would accept the oil as a gift, and if I liked it would I continue to buy it at Whole Foods. NOW THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE. Whole Foods might be higher priced than some other stores, but I'll take excellent customer service over deep discounts anytime."
21,Whole Foods Market,4 star rating,9/29/2014,"I like that this place is near my house, but it is smaller than most other whole foods. The guys at the meat counter are honest, helpful and friendly.

22,Whole Foods Market,3 star rating,9/15/2018,"Last weekend I had a hair appointment so I stopped in on the way back to pick up something for lunch, also called my mum and picked up a specific type of pasta she wanted.  To note, I'm not a regular shopper, I only visit occasionally but it seems to be a good/well run store. The flowers/customer service desk are up at the front doors which is a little crowded.  Over to the left is where they have coffee service.  Oddly to me anyway, the take out food and the hot food/salad bars are all the way on the opposite side of the store.  The whole body/vitamin and accessories section are in the mid-aisles closer to the entrance door/side of the store.  This store is on the smaller size, it was formerly a Johnny's Foodmaster/local chain Whole Foods Corp./pre Amazon bought to get a foothold, since Charlestown, similar to South Boston has experienced a lot of gentrification over the last 20 years, but intensifying in this last decade.  My chicken and avocado sandwich was fine/fresh on the the expensive side, but to be expected at Whole Foods. There is a little sitting area/counter along the windows to sit and eat and look out."
23,Whole Foods Market,3 star rating,4/22/2015,"Shop here once in a while, the selection isn't as big as I would like it to be. Some of the items can be a bit pricey.

I've never had a negative experience here."

26,Whole Foods Market,4 star rating,8/30/2013,"Whole Foods is a great addition to Charlestown!! Their prepared foods are delicious and they, despite what everyone else complains about, have a good selection.  They are awesome about posting and advertising their specials and sales, as well as going through the coupon booklet to save you some money when you're checking out.  Very nice of them.

SInce this is a grocery store there isn't a whole lot to write, but I mostly wanted to give them a great review to negate some of the lower stars!  You can't give one star because something like a grocery store is expensive- you rate it on what it is.  You don't give diamonds one star because you don't like how much they may cost, but, like anything,  you rate them based on what they are. Same thing goes for WF, it's an upscale. natural grocery store- so how does it rate compared with others?  

Keep it up WF!"
27,Whole Foods Market,5 star rating,7/16/2014,"Are you kidding me? You can't rate this place 1-star because of the prices (which are the same at each store with the occasional variation for produce and meats) or because you miss the old Foodmaster. That is simply not fair. And to the reviewer below, Neal M, I'm flagging your review for exactly that reason. 

So, my review... 
I've been a customer of the Medford location and the one at Charles River Plaza in Boston. This location is my favorite because it is closer to where I live. Just a quick ride over the Tobin Bridge from Chelsea and I'm practically there. 

This location is also my favorite because it has the biggest selection and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I was at the cold food counter (not the self-serve but the one with the attendants) and they let me have a sample of a few items I wasn't sure about and printed me out the ingredient info for several products because I am a vegetarian and have a cashew allergy. The soups are delicious and some varieties you can get in cold tubs opposite the hot soup bar if plan on eating it the next day.

The frozen food section has a very great selection of food which is another reason I love this place. I don't like to buy the frozen meals from major brands that are often loaded with chemicals. My favorite brand is Amy's which is always organic and delicious for when I'm really busy and have no time to cook. You will not be disappointed with the frozen selection here but just a heads-up, if you are a ""frozen-food connoisseur"" like me, you will be disappointed by the selection at the Medford location. 

They also have a cheese room, cheese counter, and shelves and shelves of CHEESE! Like, wow! There is so much cheese, I have no idea what to pick sometimes. And once I'm done looking at the dairy delights, I can head over next to the cheese room to find some delish vegetarian/vegan alternatives. There are plenty of vegan/vegetarian options all around the store as you would expect from a Whole Foods but this particular section has all the refrigerated Tofurky, Seitan, Tofu, and Tempeh so I usually end up buying mostly from this area since I am a big fan of the meat analogs. 

All in all, this location is the best in the Boston area in my opinion and if you are a fan of Whole Foods and live around here, it is worth the trip over. You will not be disappointed."
28,Whole Foods Market,4 star rating,8/13/2013,"I'm a Whole Foods devotee, and this location just became the closest one to my house.  Because I travel to Whole Foods in all areas to do my shopping (because there sure ain't no Whole Foods in Revere), I feel like I have become an authority of sorts on the different locations.  I mean, I've been to 'em all.  My normal store, River Street in Cambridge, remains superior to this location mainly because it's roomier and carries beer and wine.  I just visited the recently-opened Melrose location for comparison's sake, and I think the Charlestown location is better than that because it's got wider aisles than Melrose and doesn't feel as cramped.  

That said, you know what you get when you shop at Whole Foods.  You will find a bounty of organic produce, much of which is local in season, and it will all be beautiful and in tip-top condition.  You will find lovely prepared foods, a wide cheese selection, and a great deal of locally-produced items.  The shelves will be stocked with many organic, non-GMO products.  They will have canned goods available in BPA-free packaging.  On top of that, you'll get great service, a clean shopping environment, and the high price tag that comes along with it all.  

For smaller shopping trips, this will likely become my go-to Whole Foods.  But with the gargantuan new store opening in Lynnfield (which will have a beer and wine license), surrounded by awesome new shops, I'm probably going to travel the four extra miles to hit up that store on the reg."
29,Whole Foods Market,3 star rating,7/13/2016,"I visit this whole foods market as it is close to my work.   Nice and clean as it is only a year or 2 old.   I usually come here to buy some lite grocery for grab lunch as they have Pizza, Sandwich, Hot food bar, and a salad bar, though the price for the hot bar and salad bar is high for my liking at $8.99/lb.  They are not as big as the location in South End, but convenient to the locals."
30,Whole Foods Market,4 star rating,2/4/2016,"I was very mad when this place took over the Foodmaster that was here, but I've gotten over it because the delicious Whole Foods pizza has won me over. They do a good job of carrying many cheaper ""store brand"" products for those of us who aren't Monument-adjacent rich. I am impressed with the variety of unique products they do carry that I wouldn't be likely to find at the typical supermarket (Dear Whole Foods, if you stop carrying Belvoir Elderflower Presse I will cry.)."
31,Whole Foods Market,2 star rating,6/6/2017,I got a salad from the salad bar around 4pm. The quinoa cranberry was rancid and turned. That was unfortunate. Also the lady who checked us out was very rude and unfriendly. I have it 2 stars because the fruit was decent.

Much of the take out food was gone, and what was there was tasteless. Also got some tuna sashimi that was not good.

39,Whole Foods Market,3 star rating,11/7/2014,"What can I say, it's a Whole Food. You can complain about the prices and how it caters to the a certain segment of the population but I appreciate what it offers, I don't do all my shopping at one place anyway. It would be great if Whole foods and Market Basket got together and had a baby. 
I have had two experiences here, one great, one awful. 
 When it first opened I was in the bakery and needed to pick up 6 baguettes, There was nobody in line and there were 2 people behind the counter discussing something between themselves, so I stood there and waited.  After a couple of minutes the lady finally asked what I wanted. I asked for the bread,  and she moved at a snails pace to bag the bread. I did not know it but her manager was watching the whole incident from a distance. When I finally got the bread and was going to the check out the manager came up to me and told me that she was giving me the bread for free. I told her it wasn't necessary but she insisted, it was not the customer service experience that she thought I should have received. Wow, That was great customer relations.   For that they receive 5 stars. 
Recently I was in the store again, I like Whole Food pizza, a perfectly good pizza with a decent crust. I ordered 2 pizzas, when I got home and opened the boxes they were both extremely undercooked. The dough was still blonde, had no color and tasted of raw dough. By far the worst pizza I ever had. It was like buying a frozen pizza and eating it without cooking it any further.  It should have never been allowed out the door. The cooks that made the pizzas were young and very green. It's one thing to train someone to make a pizza but another thing to teach someone to care enough to make a great pizza. So, for the pizza experience, they get one star. So I'm averaging out to three stars. 
Here's the problem with a star rating system. Whole foods is a good company with a great selection of products. The people are friendly.  Their prices are high, and many stores are now offering the same products at cheaper prices.  Without taking into account the two experiences I had in Charlestown, It would have received 4 stars."
40,Whole Foods Market,5 star rating,12/30/2014,"Ok, so the prices are higher on some items, but you can't beat the customer service.  The managers and other customer service personnel recently went above and beyond... Special thanks to Marty, Kim, Zack,  and Bobby. We shop here often."
41,Whole Foods Market,5 star rating,1/4/2015,"Soooo happy Charlestown has a Whole Foods. :) It's a good one, quite large and well stocked with an especially large cheese selection."
42,Whole Foods Market,2 star rating,8/7/2013,"Ok so if you have been to a Whole Foods Market before, you know the drill, fresh food; clean stores, good service but prices high enough to give yourself chest pains.  In many respects, this is the same.  The store opened today and as a resident (I don't consider myself a toonie (Yuppie) or townie-I moved here to live with my gf who is definitely a townie, but not a typical one per say).  Anyway, I probably relate way more to Townies because I don't make over $100K a year...so that's my background because the closing of Johnnies Foodmaster that used to occupy this space was definitely earth shattering for a lot of people in the community (many of who didn't have cars) because this is where they shopped for most of their life.  Whole Foods moving in here was great news to people who like organic/healthy eating who also happened to have deep pockets.  For seniors and people of less means, this was definitely NOT good news.  I would say I fall in the middle somewhere because I lived in Medford prior to Charlestown and like the Whole Foods there.  I never would do a whole shop there but get sale items, a snack and maybe lunch.  Budget wise-I always gasped if I bought more than a few items...

As far as the store itself is concerned.  It's gorgeous and it was completed ahead of time.  Kudos to Whole Foods planners for that!  

Food wise-it looks like the same great stuff they carry in a lot of their stores and while I can't speak to trying everything (although I definitely wasn't shy about trying out free samples) it looks like you can't do wrong here.  Great food and some good options...although I am pretty unhappy that they won't be selling taco's here.  They sell them at most of the other whole foods?  Not pleased about that.  Perhaps they will make a change.  I also think the burritos are more expensive than other locations by around a $1.

As far as pricing goes, today they had some great opening day specials...and if we had room in the freezer I would have spent more than I'd liked but our fridge is full so I just got a few items, but once again, I had sticker shock.  I can't say i won't be back, but I will say I think management would be best served offering frequent promos and (to the extent they can) making the prices on staples reasonable.  They keep touting ""Community Market"" and Community this and that, but they have priced out so much of this community...  So I guess I am very mixed on this place.  It is unfortunately what I feared.  Great food, nice store but a place that will be a splurge or occasional treat, not a regular visit.  Instead I, like a lot of other locals, will probably be making the weekly jaunt to Market Basket where they have an increasing line of organics at much better prices plus basics for about 60% of what you would pay at whole foods...and I am not just talking about stuff that is bad for you.  Healthy ""whole foods"" that just cost less.

My recommendation, watch the deals at Whole Foods, stock up on meats/chicken if there is a good promo, then get some of your basics like cereal, water, even healthy bread that has no high fructose corn syrup for significantly less at another store.  Sorry Whole Foods, I just think your prices should be lower and you could still make a tidy profit...  That's my take.  BTW, I would have given them 2.5 stars, but I rounded down based on this being my least favorite of all the Whole Foods I have been to.  Don't even get me started on that parking lot..."
43,Whole Foods Market,1 star rating,8/13/2013,"Expensive, Expensive, Expensive. They need to add another $ for this place! I know these stores are not anywhere near bargain supermarkets but they are so over priced only the elite can afford to shop there. I walked down the isles and could not find a brand name I recognized!  Even though Shaw's is not cheap you still get more bang for your buck there, Whole Foods can't even come close to the prices at Market Basket. I took a pad of paper with me wrote down prices of items that I could compare even though I do not see the brands at Whole Foods any where else and I compared prices with Shaw's and Market Basket. Almost a 60% difference! The store might be clean and organized but unless your willing to unload a weeks pay for a few groceries steer clear. Right now they are packed but once most of the people realize they just can't afford to shop there on a regular basis the place will be a ghost town. The only way i would shop there if there was an emergency and I couldn't get it at Tedeschi's in the Navy Yard. Even they are less expensive than Whole Foods!

PS. I had that litte emergency and needed a couple items real quick i could not find in the Navy Yard and as much as it killed me to I had to go to Whole Foods. I do not know if it's because everything is organic or not but the food and produce I got didn't last two days! 2 freakin DAYS and I had to toss it all and to top it off the food was tasteless. For the price I paid it should have been made of a precious metal! Never again will I empty my wallet for a half a bag of groceries. I'll make the trip to Chelsea Somerville or Cambridge to get what I need."
44,Whole Foods Market,2 star rating,9/3/2013,"Was really pumped when this opened up across the street from me because the food options in Charlestown are incredibly mediocre.  I figured, ""its Whole Foods, it's going to be at least 4 out of 5 stars on yelp"".

You walk in, and yea the store looks nice and the employees are friendly and the crowd is above average looking and you can get some top notch meats and seafood and baked goods...but in my opinion the best part about Whole Foods Markets are the hot bars / prepared foods sections, and the Charlestown location completely blew it when it comes to the hot bar.  

First off, its tiny.  Its the smallest hot bar section I have ever seen in a Whole Foods, so there is not a lot to choose from.  A few soups, a lot of salad, and maybe 7 or 8 hot items.  Now, I come here a lot, and the hot bar ALWAYS has chicken wings.  And usually more than one variation.  What is this, KFC?  Where is the chicken parm, enchiladas, lasagna, sausage and peppers, shepherds pie?!?

(the rest of the store gets 4 stars - step your game up hot bar manager.  i know you can do it.  your macaroni and cheese is really good though)"
45,Whole Foods Market,4 star rating,9/8/2014,Nice shopping experience. Great employees. Very pricey but sometimes you can find good sales.
46,Whole Foods Market,4 star rating,10/15/2013,Great prepared food and excellent selection. Amazing staff. But too pricey to do all your grocery shopping there.
47,Whole Foods Market,4 star rating,8/14/2013,"I won't do all of my grocery shopping here, however I am extremely grateful that a grocery store has re-opened in this location.  I live in walking distance to this location, and it is extremely convenient for myself and hopefully my fellow Charlestown residents.  

Clearly, the selection and quality of the items available for sale is vastly improved.  The store is impeccably clean and there is a ton of staff available for assistance as you get accustomed to the layout of this store.  While I do think some of the items are expensive, which is why I will still continue to get some items at Stop & Shop, I am also a believer that in certain cases you get what you pay for.  The seafood selection is far superior to the that of Stop & Shop.  There are far more fresh seafood options as opposed to previously frozen.  While the prices are higher than Stop and Shop, some of my recent purchases there taste far better.  Additionally, the store has been running some sales in the seafood department and throughout the store, and I have been trying to take advantage of those.  Last night, I saw fresh swordfish for $10 a pound, which I felt was a pretty good value.  I see myself picking up a lot of seafood here!

Overall, I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood.  The place always seems to be jammed, but definitely less crowded than the River St. location in Cambridge or the Trader Joe's on Memorial Ave in Cambridge. I am looking forward to exploring what the store has to offer in terms of selection and what I feel represents a reasonable deal.  I also like that in a pinch, I now have the ability to walk to a grocery store to pick up that ONE item that I forgot.  Charlestown grocery store desert be GONE!"
48,Whole Foods Market,4 star rating,9/3/2013,Great location for the folks of Charlestown.  My husband and I visited just 10 days after opening day.  We found prices very reasonable.  You won't find 17 isles but you can get what you need and be out in no time.  Plenty of parking right next to the Bunker hill community college.  I'll be back when visiting my friends in Charlestown Naval yard.
49,Whole Foods Market,2 star rating,12/20/2015,"As a former whole foods market employee I can assure you that this place sucks with a passion.  This is not what whole foods market teach the employees.  Poor customer service,  tasteless hot bar,  and pizza.   Everytime I eat at this location I hit myself in the head for making the same mistake again.  Then again I am forced sometimes to eat here because of convenience of location.   I bought a burrito the other day from here,  and it just had no taste.  Even the pizza,  who could mess up on pizza at whole foods where you use the finest organic ingredients there is?  What a waste of organic goods.   If I owned whole foods I would go undercover here and check all the mess thats going on.   If you don't believe me then just go to other whole foods market locations and see the difference for yourself. I hope this comment gets to someone in charge because it's ridiculous to get poor service from an expensive place like whole foods market.  People are paying a lot here so make it worth hardworking people's money."

I made a trip up to the North End this weekend to finally give Galleria Umberto a try, and I was happy that I made the trip.  I got there a little late (around 1:30pm), and by that point they were sold out of everything besides the pizza and arancini which luckily was exactly what I wanted.  There was still a line when I came in and it moved pretty slow.  The restaurant is cash only and when I got to the counter my order of a slice of pizza, an arancini, and a can of Coke came to a bit over 7 dollars.  First I tried the pizza, which is a very tasty Sicilian slice that I would definitely recommend.  The arancini was stuffed with meat, cheese, and peas and was fried nice and crispy and again was quite tasty.  Overall, if you are looking for a cheap lunch in the North End, I don't think you could go wrong giving Galleria Umberto a try.  The food is very simple but done well.  For the price, the quality of the food was high and I would recommend anyone stop by!"
1,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,3/12/2022,"Warning: This place is constantly busy and is pretty much lunch only, as well as cash only.

Found in the North End where it's neighbors tend to have expensive options, Galleria Umberto immediately stands out for being quite cheap.
Slices are warm and can be seasoned with different types of spices.
Although the variety is limited, the quality of the sauce, crust, and cheese do stand out. The arancini is crispy and had good flavor.

While it might not be the best pizza experience, it's pretty hard to beat the price and the quality that is given at said price"
2,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,2/5/2022,"This place has been around for a very long time and is pretty old school.
Nothing fancy here, just a small eatery with counter service. 
They have some pretty good pizza (cheese only) and it's always fresh tasting and cooked just right.
They also serve a very good calzone here and the rice balls they have here are out of this world.
Service is always friendly here. 
They take cash only here for payment so if you usually don't have cash on you be sure to hit up an ATM before you arrive.
There is often a line going right out the door to get in so be prepared to wait a bit.
The place closes at around 3 PM so plan on getting here early.
I would certainly recommend trying this place."
3,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,3/24/2022,"This place is very low key and somewhat hidden if you don't pay attention. I found this place from Yelp and I didn't realize how close it is to my friend's place. You need cash for payment. There are tables for dining in. They have a small menu but the food is great. I tried out Pizzette (kinda like bagel with stuffed meat and peas), Arancini (fried rice ball with meat and peas stuffing), and Panzerotti (fried smashed potatoes with mozzarella inside) on my first visit. I got spinach, sausage, and cheese calzone on my second visit. The food was great and unique. My favorites are the arancini and pizzette. I would definitely come back when I visit Boston again."
4,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,4/11/2022,Food was excellent. There is a reason there is a line. The line moves quickly. Super friendly people working. Perfect lunch spot for kids.
5,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,1/24/2022,"Cheap, yummy, fast! This place has all the basic needs. Their cheese pizza is my favourite. I know it sound basic but trust me, the sauce to cheese ratio on that perfectly baked dough is ! It's cash only and they close early so do plan ahead."
6,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,1/7/2022,"Loved Galleria Umberto! It was like a walk back in time...nothing fancy just Great food and friendly service. The Arancini are large and great tasting and the calzone...classic, no frills, but delicious! Bravo!!!"
7,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,9/11/2021,"We loved it here! I heard about this place through some Pinterest post and I was in the mood for pizza. I didn't want a huge slice but enough to fulfill a craving. This was absolutely perfect. It's a square cheese pizza slice. I'm not normally a fan of cheese pizza but I guess that's probably because I'm
Not eating quality pizza. This changed my mind for sure. The line was a little lengthy but it's worth it. The person behind the counter was so sweet and efficient. The bathrooms were clean, too. Overall, I cannot wait to come back here. I definitely will recommend this place."
8,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,12/10/2021,"OMG how have I not left a rating on here yet???? I went to Boston in October and literally grabbed pizza from here 3 days in a row! Bob, the best tourist in the city, had our group stop by here as part of the tour, and I was not able to resist going the next few days I was in town. Simply the  BEST pizza I have ever had. I believe they only serve cheese here but that is ALL you need. They also serve calzones and croquettes which are pretty good, but doesn't heat the pizza. The combo of cheese, fresh out the oven, family environment is what makes this place so special. 

If you're in Boston, this is a MUST eat."
9,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,12/29/2021,"This is one of the last remnants from the old North End and the way things used to be. Cash only, simple, no frills. Staff is friendly and the line is long and moves at a snails pace. The menu doesn't describe anything which doesn't help. Sure would be nice to know the difference between a pizette and a panzarotti and more importantly, what's in each of them.

On the upside it's all pretty tasty. Their Sicilian cheese pizza slices are $2 a pop and nothing on the food menu is more than $5.75. Good to experience if not in a rush."
10,Galleria Umberto,1 star rating,4/2/2022,$2 a slice. You get what you pay for. Nothing special. Would be great for a night after drinking but to wait 30 mins at 1pm just to have the only option be cheese pizza... Kind of frustrating.  Then they run out of food at 145 and all those people who waited in line are @$$ out.
11,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,5/2/2021,"It doesn't get any better. These guys are slinging unmistakably good Sicilian style slices at a whopping two bucks a pop. Seriously, what more could one ask for? 

Okay, I could ask them to offer more than just cheese slices.

But then again, there's something to be said for a simple cheese slice, and what makes these cheese squares special is their lightness. 

I have rule when it comes to pizza. I've eaten pizza all over the country, in hundreds of pizzerias, and my rule has proven to be true over and over again, ""truly great pizza is light."" Umberto's well cooked thick but pillowy slices are indeed wonderfully light. Adding toppings would weigh the things down, most certainly to their detriment.

The sauce is excellent and applied with a deft hand, ""not too much, not too little."" And I approve of the browned and slightly caramelized cheese. The deeply browned cheese adds flavor and texture, which is critical as there're no toppings to accomplish that task.

Umberto opens at 10:45. We got in line at 10:30 and the line was already 15 people deep. Don't let the long line deter you. Waiting in line a few minutes is a small price to pay for the truly great simplicity of Umberto's delicious Sicilian slices."
12,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,5/9/2021,"There's nothing like a beautiful spring morning in Boston, waiting in line for pizza at 10am. 

The hype is real. I am reminiscing and wish I was waiting in that line right now. Right when they open, the line floods inside and slices are flying out the door, and at a mere $2 per slice, you know why. 

The pizza is perfect Sicilian style. That browned cheese, fluffy crust, not overly sauced. My stomach is growling. Simple is delicious and they are absolutely hitting the mark. They have a few things on the menu but we were there for the pizza. I go to Boston each year so I'll be back for more, no doubt about it. 

This was our first stop on our pizza tour and one of the best of the day. Get there early. In the first 5 minutes I swear they went through 5 sheet pans of pizzas. It's worth the early morning trip."
13,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,1/16/2022,"What more can I say? North End staple over here!!

Even with the increase in local tour groups over the years, this place doesn't disappoint and puts out consistently great slices and snacks. Corner slices all. Damn. DAY.

We always line up when frequenting the area. The only bad part is trying to live with yourself for saying no to a 3rd slice of pizza!

If you know you know, and if you don't... stop reading this review and go stuff your face already, sheesh!"
14,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,8/30/2021,"Small place you would miss if the roll up door was down. Opening at 1045 today, we arrived to find the place packed with people and a line already formed . Fast moving service with an incredibly amazing aroma of pizza. Small menu to select from but whatever you try it's well worth it. Inexpensive great tasting pizza . We ate it 3 hours later on the return flight home. Again cold or hot there is no such bad way to eat pizza! Live laugh and amore!!"
15,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,3/1/2022,"I mean it's an institution. Pizza is a miss for me. It's not bad necessarily but unremarkable. Counter Service has lost a step in speed for sure, lol, but we all do. They need young'ns up front. The rice balls were really some of the best. It's all pure comfort food and it makes no promises to be anything else. It's a must stop in the North End."
16,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,11/15/2021,"Old school Sicilian slices for $2 and tasty arancini with cheese and meat and peas for $4 - the size of a baseball and excellent. I would come back here again and again if they had a branch in the Bay Area. Nice guys, old school vibe and all cash. Stop by if they are open and thank me later !"
17,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,3/8/2022,"We had a great lunch here.  I love Sicilian pizza and this place serves authentic slices!  A simple, but great tasting menu, run by some of the nicest people we met in Boston.  We had the pizza and Arancini and ate it there.  We noticed a consistent line coming in with many obvious regular locals coming in for their lunch.  I can see why people are come in over and over again ... prices are great and the people are even better.  We'll definitely be making this place a must stop on every visit to Boston."
18,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,3/4/2022,"Always friendly and busy. Best pizza in the North End. 

Square slices so it's not everybody's favorite but I'll put it up as a challenge any time."
19,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,12/12/2020,"Came back again because I had to be back in Boston to pick up my daughter from college. I could not resist the call of Galleria Umberto. This time I got the rice balls in addition to 1/2 tray of pizza. 

So they open at 11 but there were already people inside and lined up to get food at 10:45. So I went in and since the line was so long for walk-ins, I decided to call in my order and get on the takeout line. Bad move. The line was moving faster (a relative term in GU time) on the walk-in line. Next time I'm going on the walk-in line. Clearly the regulars have figured this out. 

So the rice balls. They were delicious! I did read some reviews that people didn't like them. Personally, I thought they were yummy. Plenty of meat with peas and sauce. Nice ratio or rice to meat and perfectly seasoned. 

The pizza was sublime again. I tried to pay attention to what I loved so much about the flavor the second time around and I think it's the hint of oregano you get in the sauce. This is old school pizza at its best. Greasy but not too greasy. I'm trying to figure how they make their crust so light even though it's a Sicilian pizza. Perhaps they proof their dough a little longer. It's almost a Grandma's pizza. Again, best Sicilian I've ever had. I inhaled my first slice!

Set your expectation to wait, bring a book, bring a friend, bring your cash. Sooooo good."
20,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,2/24/2022,Still $2 slices during covid. Awesome pizza. Lines are long all week. Went on a Wednesday during lunch and still out the door. Line moves quick and well worth the 20 min wait. Recommend to anyone who isn't looking to spend $20 on lunch.
21,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,2/13/2022,"Cheese pizza was amazing, especially for the price. Old school pizza with old school prices in the heart of the North End. Worth the trip, where ever you're from!"
22,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,9/25/2021,"Best pizza in the North End. If you're looking for something quick, go here.

It is not at all like NYC thin crust pizza, but for Boston, it will pass. $2 slices and good calzones too. Umberto's is worth the trip if you're in the area.  

PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME going to other places. Regina's is pretty good as well, but this is the best for a quick stop."
23,Galleria Umberto,3 star rating,10/30/2021,"Maybe I got a bad batch, but this pizza was just OK. Greasy, chewy, soft crust. Not worth the wait in line, but the staff was friendly. They have indoor dining now and restrooms. Cash only."
24,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,4/2/2021,I've had very good square pizzas in NYC and Brooklyn.  I think this place is just as good or better than most of them.   Definitely ask for Romano cheese  which just amps up the flavor beyond the greatness.  Sweet and cheesy with a bit of a flop but great tasting crust.
25,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,11/24/2021,Best Sicilian pizza I've ever had. Very straightforward process. They've been making it exactly like this forever and I hope they never change a thing. Be prepared to wait and don't be surprised if they run out by 2pm.
26,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,8/29/2020,"I would give this place a five if it were based on just the pizza! 

I finally went to Galleria Umberto for the first time and I am so happy I did! I went on a rainy COVID afternoon around 1:30 and they thankfully had not run out pizza! I got myself a slice ($2) and arancini ($3.75). I ate the pizza right away and brought the arancini home to eat later (by heating it up in the air fryer)

The pizza was absolutely amazing for the price. The dough was the perfect balance of crispy and doughy, tomato sauce was flavorful, and the amount of cheese was perfect! I loved that it wasn't too salty either. I was warned by other helpers that the pizza is greasy so I had my napkins ready! What would've made this even more perfect is for it to be warmed up more so the cheese could be ooey gooey and a healthy amount of red pepper flakes. However, it was amazing as it is and you just can't beat the price.

My problem was with the arancini. I personally did not like the meat and the peas. It made the arancini a little too salty and the risotto itself did not have much flavor. The biggest problem was that I found a long strand of hair inside the arancini. 

Despite the arancini, I know I will be coming back here when I crave a good greasy cheap pizza!"
27,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,10/2/2021,What a great slice of pie. You better get here before 2pm or they'll run our and you'll be out of luck. And they are not shy about showing you the door when they run out.
28,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,12/28/2021,"I have walked by there location multiple times and there is always a line, so I finally decided to see if the wait is worth it and let me tell you, yes, it is! They only serve one type of pizza and it's absolutely delicious and for the piece you can't beat it! It's cash only so just remember that when you go. The line moves fairly quickly and once they are out of pizza they close for the day. So get there when they open!"
29,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,1/15/2021,"Years ago, maybe 25, I took my oldest son and 3 of his Boston college buddies here. For maybe $20 bucks they stuffed their faces. It was like I was Rockefeller.
Fast forward to covid19 it's still a deal. Excellent pizza. Same guy behind the counter, but we've both aged a bit. What hasn't changed is the outstanding Italian food.
I've brought people here for years now. They all love the joint.
You stand in line with social distancing and masks. 
You can also call in your order."

33,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,12/2/2021,What really impressed me was how polite the staff is. I was expecting a pizza nazi kind of thing as to how busy and popular they are.  It's cheap. It's old school and delicious
34,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,2/10/2020,"We stopped in here around 11:45am on a Saturday in February. There were about 15 people in line in front of us and the line took about that long, 15 minutes, which was somewhat surprising to me. Kinda thought it would be a little quicker since everything is already cooked. 

When it was my turn we got 2 slices and a spinach & cheese calzone, and a pepsi.  It was $10.45 - can't beat the prices.  I wanted to try pretty much everything but we were making multiple stops in the area for a little food tour. 

The pizza was good but not wait in line for much longer than I did good. The line got a lot worse before we left. The spinach and cheese calzone was okay in my opinion but my girlfriend liked it. I guess all the good pizza in my home area made it not seem too memorable. 

They had arancini, pizzette, paninis and panzarotti as well -- all cheap prices. 

The staff are excellent and they move very fast, it's just that there were 2 guys doing the counter for an endless line. One was doing to go orders which were massive like 10 slices and whatnot. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back but I do want to try the arancini sometime."
35,Galleria Umberto,3 star rating,12/2/2019,"I like the old-school charm of this place, but the food didn't really stand out.

I got a slice of their pizza and wasn't very impressed: the crust wasn't very crispy and I thought that the cheese to sauce ratio was a bit off. A little disappointing given how big a fan I am of the square slice and the hype reviews for this place.

Will say though, given that it only set me back $2 and the service was friendly, I've made worse decisions in my life."
36,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,6/7/2021,"Been there twice now. This place is somewhat legendary and it's like you're stepping back in time going there....which I love. Cash business, very basic menu, very straightforward way of waiting in line and ordering, the limited 11AM - 3PM hours. Basic restaurant to sit down and eat it in without much decor at all. It's cool.

I must say, though, I like the pizza, but don't love it. It's good it's just not my preferred style. That said I tried an arancini on my second visit and that was tremendous. The prices are great as well so you can get a very filling lunch here for well under $10 bucks. 

Overall, I'll go here occasionally for that reason, as well as the cool throwback vibe and good, if not great, food."
37,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,2/24/2021,"Pre-COVID-19 review: I came here after working a long night shift, and I think I was the first customer of the day. I had to wait for the first pizza to finish cooking, but I sat down and soon the very nice old man at the counter was sliding a plate of molten hot pizza in front of me. I'm a thin-crust gal, but even I thought this was excellent. Everything was in perfect balance, between the crust, sauce, and cheese, and it was done so right. For $2, it was a great deal, and the size leaves plenty of room to sample more food around the North End (or an arancini which I didn't feel like waiting around for that day). This place feels authentically North End in a way that the ritzy newer Italian restaurants don't. Definitely make it a stop on your North End eating tour."
38,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,3/26/2021,"Great fresh goods, great prices, great customer service, great taste, can't say enough good things after my first experience there."
39,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,8/8/2020,"Great pizza, cheesy and not too much sauce. Relaxed atmosphere. Definitely one of the cheaper gems in the Italian district. Arancini was interesting - meat, cheese and peas. Good prices. Pizza slice $2, water $1, rice ball $3.75. Inside seating available currently."
40,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,2/10/2020,"Last month, my friend and I went here for lunch. There was a long queue of about 20 people but the line moved pretty quickly. I got two Sicilian cheese slices and a spinach and cheese calzone. Although a bit burnt, the cheese slices were cheesy, airy and crispy.  Very yummy! You can't beat a $1.85 Sicilian slice.

The spinach and cheese calzone for $5 was also warm and tasty. If you want a good quality lunch under $10, I highly recommend this place."
41,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,9/25/2020,"This spot was recommended by a friend who's a Boston native. All I can say is WOW. I've been eating the fake stuff all my life cuz this is the real deal!!! It was delicious that I can't even describe it. 

When we got there, the line was up to the door and by the time we left, it was just longer but it's moving. There's just a lot of people in line for their Arancini balls and pizza. Highly recommend this place!!!!"
42,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,10/16/2020,"The pizza here is pretty good.

It's your typical Sicilian pizza. The cheese is nice. The dough and the sauce are both okay. They taste like they are kind of missing something, like herbs in the sauce or salt in the dough. I'm not sure, but I've had better.

My favorite Sicilian pizza place of all time in the area was Victor's in Ball Square. The dough was so soft and fluffy. It was amazing. I'm sad that it closed.

Umberto's is sort of tucked in the North End as are most places, but it's kind of like you're going down into the basement or something. The environment would be more exciting without COVID, but with it, it's okay. It's a lunch spot. The key at Umberto's is to call ahead to not have to wait too long in line.

I ate a piece on day two, and it stays tasty. I would definitely recommend this place, but don't go out of your way or expect to have your mind blown."
43,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,7/9/2019,"Yeah, it really doesn't get better than this, 10 stars! A must try before you die food spot. If your visiting Boston's Italian North End, you got to eat here.

Cheese Sicilian style square slices of pizza nirvana. Once it's gone, it's gone. They do not make more. The doors close for next days business. I suggest you get there around 10-11am lines form fast. 

TIP: Order extra slices, it's so worth it. under $2 a slice.

Try at least 1 of everything on their simple menu. I also suggest you get more than one of their Arincini rice balls stuffed with meat & cheese. It's kinda like getting shepherds pie in a fried rice ball, So Good!

Things to know before you go: - Cash Only, Closes around 3pm, Lines can get long, It's worth the wait, Order Extra ""Trust Me""

Galleria Umberto is wheelchair accessible, no power door so you will need to bring help. Staff is super, super nice. The Food is insanely awesome. You would be hard pressed to find a top notch old school family run eatery like this anywhere. 

No More Words, just go there and stuff your face!

44,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,1/14/2021,"Ran here during my lunch hour to get Sicilian slices. $2 a square is a great deal - we got 4 to share and it's a perfect lunch for 2 people. They also carry arrancini and different flavors of calzone. They're open til about 2pm so it's a lunch only kind of place.

They don't accept tips - but I wish they did. They do a great job."
45,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,11/20/2020,"Best cheese pizza in Boston! Every time I come here.. it is almost always crowded! During the summer time, there would be a line out the door.  I have tried the Sicilian cheese slice and arancini. The slice is filled with a lot of cheese and ONLY cost 2 dollars. You can't go wrong with that price point especially when the pizza is fresh from the oven. It is definitely bang for your buck! The burnt mark of the cheese adds a nice charcoal flavor and  the tomato sauce is not too sour or too sweet. In regards to the arancini, it was okay. The peas and meat was decent and the outer shell was very crunchy.  When getting the slice for take out, the workers put it in a nice cardboard box  with a string  tied around it. I notice that the store also sells calzone and I will definitely try it the next time I come here.  

TIP: Make sure to get at least three Sicilian cheese slice.. you won't regret it! Also the store only accepts cash 

Fun Fact: Galleria umberto won an award from the prestigious James Beard foundation in 2018"
46,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,8/21/2021,Best think crust pizza I've ever had in America! Aranancini are excellent. As good as in Sicily.
47,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,12/31/2021,"Got there at 11am on New Years Eve, 1 hour later, I had my pizza. Very Delicious Old School, only 2 guys taking orders, boxing it & ringing it up, so be prepared to wait some. Noticed there were 2 lines, one for phone orders & one for dine in or take out. $2 a slice, well worth it!"
48,Galleria Umberto,3 star rating,6/24/2021,"Went there this week and they ran out of food at 1:10 PM!

49,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,12/22/2020,Best pizza I had today. Honestly nothing I'll remember in a few days but the  pizza was ok. You certainly can't beat the price in the North End. 2 slices and a can of soda for under $6.

51,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,6/25/2021,"This is best pizza in the city, hands down. There's a reason they don't offer toppings - this pizza is perfect with cheese only and would be worse with toppings. It's perfection. 

Best arancini I've ever had. Calzones are delicious. 

Affordable is an understatement. It's cheap. 

The only place I'll wait in line for an hour for takeout."
52,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,7/18/2021,Best pizza in Boston and Best arancini any where in the USA!!! Except the ones my mom makes of course.

Oh
My
Gosh

I was told the wait would be worth it, and I know it would have been but I did not have to wait
SO FAST awesome guys working there

Rice ball was perfectly crispy, tender, amazing flavors. Stayed hot throughout my switching back and forth from it to the pizza
And it was so huge 

The slice was simple but amazing Sicilian 
Crispy edges, gooey cheese but not too much cheese. 

Perfect. Everything.
And the price?? They could double it and I'd pay it no question

Great great place. Authentic. Amazing. Great for a date or an afternoon playing sudoku"
55,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,10/27/2018,"Great no frill place totally deserving of 2018 James Beard Classics award that you definitely should check out if you are into casual pizza, Italian food. Where else would you find tasty, affordable Italian fast food for Bostonians (and tourists) of all budgets other than Galleria Umberto.

The place has a number of seats and the lines build up fast after the store opens. So, get there early if you want to make sure you get to try specific things you like.

We were one of the first people who got there on early right after the shop opened, so...what other foodie thing to do other than to order a bit of everything + drinks to share for ~$20ish?!

I think this place is more known for pizza, but to be honest, out of all the things I tried (pizza, calzone, arancini, mashed potato ball which I have no idea what it's called in Italian..panzeroti?) that day, I loved their arancini the most! Tasty rice with a lil bit if minced salty meat in the middle. The pizza was good as well esp given the price...but I found it to be slightly too oily for my taste.

Otherwise, great spot to have your quick no frill lunch and after you are done...stroll across the street to get your desserts from Mike's pastry!

P.S. cash only!"
56,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,10/7/2018,"Possibly one of the least expensive means that I've had in the North End, I got a slice of Umberto's Sicilian that was fresh from the oven and took with me a spinach and cheese calzone to go.

The pizza was a little greasy but the lovely toasted cheese on top was delicious. Fresh out of the oven, they make these pies all day and they hit the counter and are then gone. Yum!

The calzone was delicious and a good portion.

Hard to beat the price here. I'm a fan!"
57,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,5/30/2021,"Very cheap $2 slices of cheese pizza and $3.75 for arancini. Was able to have a meal for 2 for under $10 which is rare in Boston.

Both the pizza and arancini were solid for what we paid and the staff was very efficient."
58,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,9/24/2018,"*** JBF America's Classic (2018) *** #21 ***

This is what James Beard Awards are all about, and why I prefer them to Michelin Stars.  No frills here.  One type of pizza, for $1.90 a slice (eat in, or $1.40 takeaway) and the friendliest people behind the register who, sure, appreciate the James Beard Award, but it doesn't change anything for them.  They are just interested in serving up a good slice of pie to their loyal customers.

To my dismay (yes I should have checked yelp) they were closed on Sunday.  This is the only place I wanted to eat while I was in Boston for a long weekend, so I made sure to uber specifically there for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised that there was no line and plenty of tables. Must be because it was a Monday and a bit cold out.  I inquired as to all the various items in their display (arancini, calzones, etc) but knew I was going to start with a slice of the pizza.  Was it life changing pizza? No. But for $1.90 it was pretty darn good.  Not too greasy and cooked just the right amount. Simple, but good.  

I decided to also try the spinach and sausage calzone, which for $5.50 is one of the pricier items on the menu (seriously) and it was also not life changing, but very good. Not too cheesy, not too greasy, with a good amount of spinach and sausage (not too bready either). Definitely a fan.

What makes this place a stand-out establishment and worthy of 5 stars in my book is the history, the service (I felt very welcomed and like they were really proud of everything they serve here), the un-pretentiousness despite having just won a James Beard Award (and that you know the Award won't change them one bit), and the ridiculously cheap prices despite being in the most desirable location in the North End.

Thank you, Galleria Umberto, for making my trip to Boston worth it!"
59,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,9/25/2019,"Do you want an affordable slice of pizza? For $2 (cash only) come grab a slice of their sicilian style square cheese pizza. No frills. What you see is what you get here. Hearty slice, very thick with an unbelievably flavorful tomato sauce. Delightful snack."
60,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,11/4/2021,"This is the real deal - the menu isn't extensive and sure, the space been updated for several decades.  But the pizza is the best around and the owner couldn't be nicer!  Go early and enjoy!!!  I lived in the North End for many years, and now visiting Galleria Umberto is the reason I go back."
61,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,6/13/2019,"OMG!!! I will start off by telling you a story from my visit. STORY TIME 

Im standing in this very very long line and Im a little curious because the menu says slices are $1.90... and Im wondering what an arancini is.... and then I order.. Like a million slices and im waiting to pick them up at the counter. When the man behind the counter motions at someone standing behind me. No doubt the dude behind me is a little awkward looking- but Im friendly so whatev's... I move out of the way so they can talk and I can ear hustle. So baby I realize this dude is speaking some deep language.. its a little harsh and I can tell its not English... ITS ITALIAN!!! The dude was completely skipping the line and now he was ordering in actual Italian and the slices were $1.90. EPIC 

SO the pizza was so good and garlicky!!!! The cheese was soft and flavorful - I opted out of the Arancini ( too many slices) and devoured some 3-4 slices... I literally love the atmosphere.. its like old world Italian meets a cafeteria."
62,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,9/18/2021,"Another great find thanks to all the positive Yelp reviews.  Pizza was amazing. and done right with simple, quality ingredients.  Good ratio of cheese, dough and sauce.  Worth the wait and a bargain at only $2 per slice.  Must stop anytime you're in Boston.  Go early before pizza runs out about 2:30 pm."

Originally I wasn't planning to come here because my itinerary was jam-packed various food places, but I decided to sneak this pizzeria into my itinerary after I learned that Galleria Umberto had won 2018 America's Classics Award from the James Beard Foundation.

Galleria Umberto is best known for their squared shape Sicilian pizza. Each pizza slice is $1.85 and there is only one type of pizza (more specially Sicilian cheese pizza - no salami and pepperoni, period). In addition, they also sell panini (salami, ham, & mozzarella cheese), pizzette, panzarotti (breaded potato with mozzarella cheese & parsley inside), arancini (breaded ball of rice, stuffed with a sauce, filled with ground beef, peas, & cheese), and calzone (with four different options). The door already opened at 10:50 AM on Monday even though it was supposed to open at 11 AM. We were one of the first customers and thank goodness there was no wait.

***

Pizza ($1.85): Very simple but delicious pizza; tomato sauce tasted just right (not too heavy and not too sour with a hint of sweetness) and dough didn't taste dull at all. I like it a lot - definitely one of the better pizza I have had. (5/5)

Calzone (spinach and cheese - $5): Filling was savory, but bread was just a-okay. (4/5)

***

4.5-star on food, but I will bump it up to 5-star because you are getting delicious slices of pizza at a really inexpensive price."
65,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,3/26/2021,"This place is the REAL DEAL. CASH only, fast paced, simple selections and if you miss out you miss out. I love the North End and these types of places are a dying breed."
66,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,9/19/2021,The best hidden jewel in Bostons north end is galleria umberto The best Italian subs you ever eat get here early it closes before two or 3 PM
67,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,8/12/2018,"I'm a local and have only recently visited Umberto- I'm usually more of a thin crust pizza person, plus you need to get down here at lunch before they sell out (easiest if you live or work around here, less easy if not) and it's always touted as a tourist must, so I just didn't make the effort to try it until now.

But I ended up being pretty pleased with their $2 Sicilian-style cheese slice- it was light and fluffy, with a good flavor to the dough, a kiss of balanced tomato sauce, and topped with a thin layer of charred cheese. I was lucky enough to get a corner slice, so got a bit of crispy crust as well (get this if you can). 

That being said, this pizza wasn't a total revelation and/or didn't automatically surpass all other pizzas forever and ever, for me- so don't kill yourself trying to get here just because all the food shows and critics rave about it. But if you're in the area and they haven't sold out, it's worth getting in the (fast-moving) line for a tasty treat for two bucks."
68,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,8/28/2021,The best slice of pizza you can put in your mouth. The great taste of real mozzarella and the crispy crust unreal.beats all others including its neighbors Regina pizza!
69,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,1/25/2019,"TLDR: solid pizza for a great price at this neighborhood institution. 

No frills place that serves up slices of cheese pizza, paninis and arancinis. It's open for lunch only and there's always a line. Is this the best pizza in the world?  I don't know. It's cheese pizza only but it's well done. Crust is crisp with some chew to it. It's a good slice of pizza. The arancini I had today was also super solid. This place is super hyped up and if you take it to be a good value slice of pizza I think it totally meets it. Best pizza ever? Not quite. I'm very happy places like this exist and wish I lived closer to eat it more often."
70,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,11/15/2018,"The Little Italy neighborhood is full of tasty spots to grab a meal, but if you only eat one slice, get it here- Galleria Umberto recently received the coveted James Beard American Classics award, for ""quality food, local character, and lasting appeal."" All of this is immediately evident from the line snaking towards the door even between mealtimes. 

Ordered a slice (square, Sicilian, your only option) and one of their softball-sized arancini (classically filled with ragu, mozz, and peas). The menu is limited but these are the most recommended items and they did not fail to impress. Additional options include calzone, pizzette, and panini. Even sharing, this was enough carbs to be a filling snack. The red sauce is spot-on, the crust has great chew, the cheese is gorgeously blistered without tasting burnt. It's been hard to find arancini with peas but this version really made me understand what a difference the addition makes- that slightly sweet contrast, the little pop of color and texture. I get it now. My Italian mom fell for the classic arancini so hard she wanted to take some home on the plane!"
71,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,5/21/2017,"It happens all too seldom.

It happens when you walk into a place for the first time, and you fall in love at first sight.

We both fell head over heels with Galleria Umberto and I bet you will too.

We were walking around the North End at lunch time, and that's a pretty difficult position to be in because, there's like a hundred restaurants pretty much side by side on both sides of the street.

We decided on pizza as opposed to a full meal, so we fired up the Yelp app, filtered for pizza and what headed the list? None other than Galleria Umberto.

This is no frills to the max- you order at the counter and carry your prizes to one of the many tables and chairs in the spartan dining room.  The menu is incredibly small--- just slices of cheese pizza for $1.85 (mozzarella cheese only -no figs or arugula or even meatballs here), a Panini for $2.75, a small pizza (pizzette) for $2.25, a panzarotti (small fried calzone) for $1.85, a huge arancini (stuffed rice bowl for $3.50), plus four calzones for around $5. That's all.

The pizza ceremony is a hoot- a guy lugs a huge tray pan of Sicilian pizza out of the kitchen, cuts it into squares in front of you, and uses a spatula to carefully scoop slices onto a paper plate- one slice per plate.

Check out this pic I took -I was in the right place at the right time for this baby!

You just can't explain how great it is and how that family has endured ages of top dog Italian food for the masses! Wish I was there right now!! Yum, Yum, Yum!

73,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,5/25/2017,"The mythical Galleria Umberto ... I had this spot bookmarked for months and every time I went to the North End it was either closed (because they close down shop once they've run out of food/supplies for the day) or I couldn't find it (because their sign was covered by scaffolding for quite a while). Anyways, with only a few days left in Boston, I decided to try one more time to have lunch at Galleria Umberto before moving. And I was in luck! Not only did I find Galleria Umberto (the scaffolding was gone) and they were open BUT there was no line! *Gasp!* Perhaps because it was a rainy and cold Boston Thursday. 

Regardless, I walked right in and right up to the counter to place my order. I got a slice of Sicilian cheese pizza - the only kind of pizza they serve - and an aranchini (rice ball with meat, cheese, and peas inside). Both were piping hot and fresh and very tasty. For just over $5, I had a feast for lunch. 

The menu is simple, they only take cash, and parking in the North End is a nightmare, but if you find yourself in Hanover street at lunchtime, I'd recommend Galleria Umberto."

75,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,10/16/2018,"This is an affordable and low-maintenance pizza place with a limited menu. The service is standard and the setting is casual. Come for the arancini and cheese pizza, but don't forget to pay in cash since that's the only acceptable form of payment.

I ordered 3 cheese pizza slices, an arancini, and a spinach & cheese calzone. By the way, cheese was the only topping they had for the pizzas. The cheese pizza was just brought out from the oven when I was ordering, so I was happy to see that I was the first to get the new batch of fresh, hot slices. Now, I'm not a big fan of pizza but the pizza here really was amazing. It had a good ratio of crust, sauce, and cheese. The cheese had a nice saltiness, and I especially loved the flavor and texture of the charred bits. The arancini was also delicious. I loved that the outside had a nice, slightly crunchy bite and the inside flavors of the meat, cheese and peas were savory. Unfortunately, the spinach & cheese calzone missed the mark for me. It was very plain and underseasoned. The spinach tasted like it was probably from a can. I was forcing myself to eat it because I didn't want to waste it. I would not recommend this item."
76,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,11/13/2021,absolutely can not go wrong here.  delicious immaculate and unbelievable prices. a family of 4 could eat for 25 dollars or less.  only open 11-2 or 3. also prepare to wait in line.  you won't be sorry.

Yeah, they sell a few other things in this counter-service, line-stretching-to-the-door, sells-out-early, decades-old classic in Boston's North End.  But that cheese slice is exactly what you want.   Toppings?  Sorry, not here.  But with thick, perfectly burnt cheese and a pillowy crust, you won't want anything else on it anyway.

78,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,1/14/2017,"This pizza is as good as the lines make it out to be. People aren't as crazy as you think. They know good pizza. Just follow the line of people out the door OR get lucky and get there right when they open. You will be the 4th or so person in line and you'll definitely get a seat. So enjoy slabs of delicious, thick squares as the line grows longer.

The pizza: filling, oozing with cheese, delicate sauce. Extremely flavorful and cheap. Paired with a soda, it's a perfect budget-lunch. I'm not one to get a Sicilian slice but this has changed my mind. I often lean toward thin-crust NY style pizza but I may have just found a new love...

Worth waiting in line. Only complaint is of course the long lines and the fact that they close so early because I would love to stop in for dinner not just lunch. I guess the concept for the owners is simple: give until it's gone! So get there before it is."

Hands down the best pizza in Boston! from the Pizza dough to the sauce you can taste the love and hard work put into this pizza I love it! They also sell pizza dough and pizza by the pan for take out...The interior is old school and outdated but it's authentic...The prices could not be more reasonable...If you like cheap, tasty, fresh authentic Italian food served in a warm environment in an old school, Mom and Pop restaurant with amazing prices, this place is for you! 100% recommend!"

The cheese pizza is perfectly simplicity at its finest. The crust is perfectly crunchy and buttery and the whole thing just works. It's a pizza that's absolutely perfect just being cheese and I love that.

We tried a panzarotti and it was honestly one of the best things I've ever eaten. It's a perfect potato and cheese bite and just thinking about it makes me want to stand in line tomorrow for another.

Also, the guys who work up front are super friendly and helpful. Absolutely go if you want pizza and something different than a traditional slice. Our favorite meal in Boston!"

85,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,6/19/2020,"Pizza is awesome! If a pizza place only accepts cash, shuts down for the day once sold out and lunch costs under $5, you KNOW it's gonna be legit. Regina has a rival in the North End!"
86,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,12/6/2019,"Umberto is a Boston institution and the kind of place that is disappearing too fast. The neighborhood favorite opens up at 1130am Mon-Sat and is normally sold out of its limited menu by 2pm. 

Ralph and Arthur run a pretty tight ship. Everything is made fresh daily and there are no substitutions, featured items or surprises of any kind!
One type of Sicilian style cheese pizza is served by the slice (~$2 a piece, cash only). There are a handful of other menu options, of which the arancini is certainly the crown jewel. House wine is served at just under $3, making this one of the last places in town you can have a meal and a drink for under $5. This is not necessarily the best pizza you'll eat in your life, but it is consistently fresh and delicious.

 In short, this is a spot you'll want to experience as a regular rather than a tourist. One of the few Boston establishments worth the long lineup."
87,Galleria Umberto,4 star rating,7/19/2019,"Just about the best cheese pizza you can get, but beyond that, I don't know what to tell you. There's a very authentic feel to the whole deal: from the product to the service, this is the Italian experience for sure. An unbeatable price for a quick bite to grab in a hurry or a place to relax and people watch, just don't expect anything life-changing."
88,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,6/19/2019,"Absolutely loved it here.  Come early because the line gets very long.  As everyone else said, bring cash- only thing they will accept.  

Prices are extremely reasonable and lots of hard to find Italian items like panzarotis.  We got one of almost everything to split because we didn't want to miss out.  Saw so many reviews on Yelp and YouTube and didn't want to miss out.  Lived up to the hype."
89,Galleria Umberto,5 star rating,2/7/2020,"This place is an institution, specifically a Sicilian institution. They have classic square slices and they'll knock your socks off. Galleria Umberto isn't big, and good luck finding parking, but overall it's a must when you're in Boston. They have more than slices by the way, just make a sure you arrive early to beat the long lines!"
