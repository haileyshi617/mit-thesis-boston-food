0,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,2/25/2022,"Service: 
We went as a group of 4 on a weekend but early in the day and were able to sit immediately. 
We were welcomed as soon as we walked in and the staff was beyond patient in describing the menu options and vegan options too!

Inside:
As soon as you walk in the amazing smells of fresh and delicious ramen overwhelmed the entrance and if I wasn't already, it sure would've made me instantly hungry!
Their decor and painted walls are super cool the music played in the background makes it a nice and casual eatery.

Ramen: 
Delicious, savory fresh and you can watch them prep it! 
Big portions you could easily split or take home for later!"
1,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,4/1/2022,"Happy to see a vegan ramen place. Boston has a lot of popular ramen joints but most of them don't offer a broth for vegetarians/vegan. Red white ramen is building up on that space by providing a number of vegan ramen. 

My favorites:
Tokyo Masala - Mildly Spicy. it brought out the flavors of the Indian sun-continent and reminded me of a popular noodle back in India. Loved it to every bit. Loved the way you could customize your ramens. If you are not a fan of bamboo, you could probably avoid them. 

Sesame ramen - Not for spice lovers. This one had a strong taste of sesame to each mouth. 

PROS: 
# heart of newbury street
# quick serving of the order 
# ample parking space 
# ample dining area 

CONS:
# not an eco-friendly place 
# plastic spoons, plastic forks, plastic chopsticks, paper ramen bowl."
2,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,1/17/2022,"So this is not traditional ramen. This has been heavily Americanized with cheese in it as well as loads of vegan and vegetarian options. Take that for what you will but I wasn't a fan. The flavor tasted fattening and bland. The name serves it right though, this is the kind of place you go to after a baseball game when you just need food and don't really care what it is. 

In Boston there is a wealth of Japanese Ramen spots that are keen to challenge your palette and present you with bold and well catered flavors. This just isn't one of the places. This flys in the face of what ramen should be, it isn't healthy, and it is clearly trying far too hard to be liked by the american sports crowd and masses walking past their Newbury location. 

Packaging feels like thought went into it at first glance but once you feel it it's cheap and flimsy. Not to mention it features quite a lot of plastic including a plastic coating around the bowl."
3,RED WHITE RAMEN,1 star rating,1/8/2022,"I was on a vegetarian ramen kick so when I saw this vegan ramen place I had to try it in hopes to find a vegan ramen that I could love. After eating at Red White I have to say I won't be back. I can deal when the food is ugly yet delicious but when it's both ugly and not delicious then I have a problem. 

The one dish I had the most problem with was the  MASTERPIECE ""Creamy Sesame Taste"". The broth as you continued to eat it was getting darker and darker, it was so unappealing. I think it was due to the black sesame and the mushrooms in the broth that made the broth turn dark. And there was too many toppings which turned out to be way overwhelming and it just didn't taste good overall. The fact it came in a paper container everything was a pile on top of each other and it became a bowl of mush. Ramen should be in a porcelain bowl PERIOD! Not in this ice cream container.

I also ordered the BUDDHA RICE with Roasted Miso Avocado. The only thing that tasted good was the roasted miso avocado. As for the rice itself it was a hodgepodge of rice and veggies, which I wanted sushi rice vinegar to season the mish mosh of rice and veggies. It wasn't anything delightful tasting really. However, it was definitely better tasting than the ramen I had. The hunt continues to find a vegan ramen I love."
4,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,12/27/2021,"It was cold out and my group was going to walk around and venture out to see some of Boston. I wanted something warm and found this Japanese Ramen place that's vegan. 
This place is small, has cute decor and service was fast. As you walk in there's a counter to place your order and pay. Once the order is ready, they call out your name to come pick it up. I had questions about the menu and the person at the counter took his time to explain to us about the options. 
The ramen was really good. The portions are big and filling or even shareable. We took one to go and they pack it up very well. 
It's definitely a place I'd go back to when I go back and visit again."
5,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,10/20/2021,"My friend and I came here to try this place thinking it was vegan friendly and we were not disappointed. I was in a bit of shock when the worker here told me everything is vegan (hooray for me) but not for long as they have so many flavors to choose from. I must say: these were the best noodles I have ever eaten. They were perfectly chewy and slurpable. We are still talking about it. 

They bring your food outside if you manage to snag a seat and are quite fast. I definitely recommend the masterpiece if you like sesame. The Sapporo broth was ok. I wouldn't have minded more ginger. The meat sub they use is pretty good but I wish it were sliced larger so it didn't sink to the bottom of the bowl. All in all, solid, affordable, delicious noodles."
6,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/13/2021,"Red White has some amazing ramen. But what's truly incredible is that it's all vegan. I grew up on ramen. Ramen is my comfort food. I know ramen. And let me tell you, I almost fainted from delight, their ramen was so good.

Bring all your friends here. Even meat-eater types. They won't even notice that there's no meat in here. The flavor is packed with umami. And rather than the standard toppings, they go with mushrooms, corn, and spinach -- and they work really well.

I thought I'd give this place a try because I was in town for the marathon, and I was trying to figure out how I could manage to eat a vegan ramen -- and this place was recommended to me by a friend of mine. So glad she did. I was here for four days, and you wanna know how often I ate here? FOUR TIMES.

I had their Sapporo Buddha, which has a really rich miso broth. Then on day 2, I brought a former colleague of mine for lunch, and we both had the Buddha Rice bowls. I figured I'd try something a little different. So glad I did, because that dish is crazy good. Do NOT be lulled into thinking it's just another power grain bowl. It's very rich in flavor and texture. Plus, the avocado with baked miso on top is just to die for. It just takes it to a whole 'nother level.

Day 3 was race day. That's right. After I ran 26.2 miles for a marathon, I walked the four blocks over, still wearing my mylar blanket, to this place, so I could take a bowl of ramen back to my hotel room to enjoy. Even after I showered and the soup wasn't super hot anymore, it was just as rewarding. I actually started thinking about it in the last miles of the race!

The last order was another Buddha Rice bowl, which I bought to take with me on my flight home. So glad I did. It was MUCH better than airline food.

Wish they had a Red White near my place (in SF Bay Area). Well maybe not. That would be dangerous. Because I'd want to eat there all the time.

Bottom line: Even if you eat meat, go check out Red White Buddha Ramen. These guys are making some amazing noodle bowls. I know there are some other popular ramen places near Back Bay (with way longer lines) but I'd recommend you try this place.

A couple of tips: The place is right on Newbury, but like a lot of places, the indoor dining and ordering counter are down a flight of stairs. There are several indoor tables, but the air circulation is pretty good, and the tables turn over pretty quickly. They also have outdoor seating in a ""parklet"" right in front of their establishment. ALL food is served in to-go containers regardless of whether you dine in or not. But the best part, if you order it to go, is their packaging. The soup is in the actual bowl portion, but they use a really clever lid that comes in two pieces: They nest like a regular clamshell container, and when you snap the two lid parts together, you also get to snap it on top of the soup bowl. That way, the noodles don't get soft until you're ready to mix it into the soup. Genius!

GO EAT HERE. You will NOT regret it. Trust me, next time I'm in Bahst'n, I WILL be eating here again. And again."
7,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,12/28/2021,"honestly a BOMB ramen place.

we ordered the dragon breath and it was so good. the spice comes from habanero pepper smashed on the side so you can add the spice to your liking. also, since its habanero, it doesn't alter the flavor, but gives it quite a kick. the noodles were chewy and thick and the soup was thiccc as well. the mushrooms inside were nicely marinated and it was really good :)"
8,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,4/5/2022,The Tokyo Masala was an interesting fusion. Very tasty.  It was also better when they let you choose the individual ingredients. The tables are too small and uncomfortable.
9,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,8/31/2021,"Stopped by for lunch while shopping on Newbury and ate one of the most delicious bowls of vegetarian ramen I've ever had. The porcini broth was creamy and flavorful with sesame and chili. The noodles had a nice chewy texture that complemented the broth well. The toppings also went well with everything else in the bowl. 

The ramen was priced well at about $12 and it came out pretty fast in a to-go container that I ate inside. The place was clean as well. I definitely want to come back and try their other ramens and with cheese topping too!"
10,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,9/30/2021,"Came here on a Sunday morning. Your order is placed at the front and then can sit inside or outside. You have the option or grabbing the food or they will bring the food out to you. Take out is also an option as they have a shelf set up right next to the door for convenient grab and go style. 

I tried the dragon breath ""special"" which included fried onions and cheese. It was pretty salty so I added a fair amount of water to dilute the broth which wasn't a problem since I usually enjoy more broth anyways. The Ramen itself was a little bit more firm than I am used to. However, I also prefer undercooked rather than over. Given that the dish was entirely vegan, I was surprised at the depth and umami flavors. I appreciated the toppings offered as it provided varied taste and texture each bite. 

Service was friendly and I will definitely come again. Prices are a little high but expected given the location and quality of the food. Not to mention being entirely plant-based!"
11,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,12/21/2021,"I really wanted to like this place after seeing all the great reviews. I came here, hopeful, and was greeted warmly by the man working at the front and he helped give us recommendations. I got the Buddha's bowl and my friend got the Masterpiece. The food came out within 10 minutes, which was nice because we were starving after walking around Newbury all day. 

After taking the first sip, we were immediately taken aback by how bad it was. The broth was super thick and lacked any kind of flavor. It tasted like someone boiled an onion, threw in some veggies/noodles, and called it a day. Neither of us ended up finishing the ramen. I forced myself to eat a few bites before I physically could not eat any more, which is saying a lot because I am the equivalent of a human trash can. The ramen just looks and tastes so sad in comparison to all the photos and reviews on here."
12,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,9/28/2021,"Whoever said the Dragon Breath was disappointingly not spicy must actually be a dragon, because there's no way it can be considered ""not spicy"". As an avid lover of spicy food, I tasted the capsaicin before the noodles even reached my mouth. This felt like fire noodles, except the effects don't creep up on you- they come immediately.

Crazy spice aside (which is exactly what they advertised), the ramen is just alright. Loved the chewy semi-firm texture and the broth is good. Not as rich as non-vegan ramen, but that's to be expected. I'm a bit disappointed with the narrow disposable bowls for dining in and the lack of substantial toppings, but it's a solid choice for vegan ramen!"
13,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,12/20/2021,"Vegan ramen that actually tastes like ramen and not watered down broth. It is very much an eat and go kind of setting but that not surprising as it is decorated and set up to be like ramen-ya back in Japan .

The staff are great and the food is too. It's one of the few places I'm willing to travel to eat at.

I always order extra toppings because I'm a glutton."
14,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,12/9/2021,"We were chilled and decided that hot soup was the right answer for lunch. I ordered the Masterpiece, A ordered the Special.
The seating area is no-frills, but sufficient for consuming a (disposable) bowl of soup.
At first, I was not impressed with the flavors and consistency of my Masterpiece...but a short time later I had a complete change of heart and realized that it was actually very good...really.  A loved her Special.
On a chilly day I would go back."
15,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,4/2/2022,"Decent flavor but overall it wasn't satisfying ramen. I got the truffle flavor and the smell was pretty overbearing from the start. Also the tofu/meat that comes with the ramen had a strange texture. There's no option to add an egg or charshiu like other restaurants, it seems like most of the food served here is takeout. Overall, wouldn't consider this a ramen place and both my friend and I didn't end up finishing our noodles."
16,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,6/30/2021,"Ordered the Dragon Breath ramen with crispy onions via doordash. (They also had a deal for 20% off orders $15 or more, up to a $5 discount)

Food was DELICIOUS. I'm always hesitant about ordering ramen for take out but it was still hot and everything was packaged really well. The broth had so much umami flavors that my only regret was not purchasing more broth on the side.  I really like spicy food and didn't think the Dragon Breath was that spicy - but it has a slight kick and was full of flavor. Would HIGHLY recommend."
17,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,12/12/2021,"New favorite spot for ramen! We stopped by Red White on Newbury for lunch on Saturday and had a great time! It looks like they do a lot of delivery but they also had a handful of tables where you could seat yourself. We ordered at the counter then sat at a table until they called our name, we went around 1pm and while all the seats were being used there was a ton of turnover so no one waited for a table. We got the truffle and classic miso ramens which were phenomenal! Both came with corn, spinach, mushrooms and tofu... they're all vegan!! We also tried the miso avocado which Id recommend if you love miso! Very reasonably priced and they get your food to you quickly. We had a great time and will be back."
18,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,2/17/2022,"Great ramen spot! They have just a few choices for the ramen and that's kind of nice because it is not overwhelming to decide. I had the Masterpiece ramen with the Special topping (which comes with shredded cheese and crispy onion). The ramen itself was great, I liked the umami flavor and the nice texture of the noodles. It was a very filling lunch without being overly heavy. Next time I would likely not get the special topping, it's an extra $3 for a little bit of cheese and crispy onion topping and I feel like there was not a lot of added flavor that made the dish significantly better for me, so I would say the special is not worth it."
19,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,5/15/2021,"The food at this vegan restaurant was surprisingly delicious. Not only was the broth flavorful, but the well integrated elements of each part in the ramen truly elevated the whole dish to another level. It didn't taste fake or lacking in anyway. To be honest I probably wouldn't have even known there were no animal products in the ramen had I not known in advance. 

The staff was extraordinarily helpful and kind. They explained the differences of each dish on the menu and made the food in a timely manner. Would totally come again."
20,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,3/1/2022,"Great option for a vegan ramen! The broth is creamy and thick compared to traditional ramen, noodles were great but I was not floored by the flavor but would definitely have it again. Giving it 3/5 stars because I've had much more flavorful vegetarian/vegan ramen so there's definitely room for improvement! Btw seating is limited*"
21,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,4/25/2021,"Would recommend this place if you're looking for fast casual, filling meal in the area! 

I didn't know that the food was vegan, but I was pretty impressed with the protein replacements actually. I got the Masterpiece ramen which had a creamy sesame broth that was tasty. Overall, pretty good for fast casual food. Not the best ramen in the world, but definitely great value for what I got - $11 a bowl. Everything else on Newbury St is so pricy, so it was perfect to find this place! As a non-vegan, definitely missed having the meat in my ramen :/ 

They have two outdoor tables for people to eat at, and a couple indoor that were available too. The staff were very friendly and explained the different menu options as it was my first time there. The food came out very fast, and portions were very filling."
22,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,9/21/2021,"Because of the raving review, I was stoked to try this place, especially because it's walking distance to me. Service is awesome & my takeout order was ready quick and packed perfectly. But the food here just isn't for me. 

I got the Sapporo Buddha, the only good thing about it was the noodles. For the first time ever, I dumped a whole ramen dish in the trash; it was painful to do. It was beyond salty and made it inedible. I know miso is salty, but this wasn't my first ramen.. so I know it can be delicious. 

I also got the Buddha rice. It was okay, the miso avocado was delicious and that's about it. End of the story, I pretty much dumped $30 into the trash & wasted food."
23,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,3/21/2022,I went here today and I was quite disappointed.  I ordered the masterpiece which came in a paper take-out container.  I guess taking pictures from directly on top makes it look like a real ramen bowl.  I was also hoping to get a beer like you would get in a real ramen place.  But the real problem with this was that it was bitter.  The soup flavor was bitter.  Aside from that some of the ingredients were cold.  I guess this place is the Chipotle of ramen.
24,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,9/23/2021,"I don't know what it is about Newbury, but I feel like the people who review restaurants here have never eaten anywhere else.  It's like ""OMG this place puts its food on plates, 5 stars!"" Really, Dunkin Donuts is like 5 stars on Newbury and 3 on Boylston.  You get what you pay for.

I mean, except on Newbury.  In which case you get an absolute generic paper bowl filled with nonsense for $16.  I mean, it's not bad, but what I ended up with was a whole lot of noodles, a few mushrooms and a metric ton of corn.  I'm not one to point people at Santouka, but for $16 they give you some pork, at least.  The broth was...okay, but ramen, in my (meager) experience is supposed to be this thick porky sludge that has so much complexity to it your mouth just kind of gives up and is like ""yeah, pleasure, whatever"".  This was...just okay.

But maybe I got the wrong thing.  People are ranting about the vegetarian ramen which sounds like an oxymoron to me, but hey.  It's Newbury.  Anything goes.  And then gets 5 stars.

Service was really nice, though."
25,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,1/16/2022,"I haven't been to a place that has all-vegan ramen  in two years. This really made me the happiest I have been in so long! I got their basic one, the Masterpiece which has tofu bits, mushrooms , spinach, and corn  The broth is sesame-based. The noodles were how I like them, thick and chewy, and all the toppings were fresh and that broth tho  If you're ever in Boston, check out Red White in the Back Bay Area"
26,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/1/2021,"RED WHITE packs the savory flavor - appealing to ramen lovers everywhere and particularly any prior victim of a bland vegetarian broth! Every bowl includes fresh spinach, mushroom, corn, tofu, soy meat, and perfectly cooked ramen in your choice of satisfying broth. I loved the King & Queen - its rich aroma  and almost creamy truffle taste made it the best ramen bowl I've ever had. The Miso Avocado was definitely an acquired taste, but if you love either of those flavors you might be really into it.

The friendly staff, ambiance, and cozy Newbury location (with patio!) only add to RED WHITE's greatness. I really hope you come here and experience the same umami joy ride as I did!"
27,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,2/16/2022,EXCELLENT vegan ramen!! Perfect for meat eaters because they don't advertise as a vegan ramen shop but everything is and it's so cute and casual on the inside. Every time I go the chefs are working so hard and you can see them putting so much love into their creations. They deserve 10/5 stars.
28,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,11/16/2021,"This place blew me away! My mom and I came here for dinner after an eventful day of exploring the city and this was just what we needed to more than satisfy our hungry bellies! 
We shared the masterpiece creamy sesame ramen and the buddha rice bowl with roasted miso avocado. Both were extremely delicious but the latter really just stole the show... and my heart. The creamy avocado with the fire-roasted miso glaze... my tastebuds were dancing with every single bite and I never wanted it to end!! 

If you're ever in the area, you need to come here and experience the magic that I experienced with this miso glazed avocado buddha bowl! You won't regret ittt!!! 

Also the ambiance was nice and the service was great!"
29,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,8/13/2021,"The hype is so real.

I've been to tons of vegan ramen places all over SoCal and the Bay Area, and quite frankly they're all pretty disappointing. Especially when compared to some of the vegan ramen places I've went to in Japan which have been life-changingly incredible, they just can't stack up.

So as a semi-experienced vegan ramen orderer, I have to say that Red White is honestly comparable with the vegan ramen I've had in Japan. The sesame broth was incredibly flavorful and the toppings are all really tasty and meat-like too. Would really recommend upgrading and getting the cheese and crispy onions. Price is overall pretty affordable too, I remember it being like $13 plus tax for a bowl. Small disclaimer, I would suggest not ordering the ""Mix Well"" dry ramen (it's kind of just like the sesame ramen just without that delicious broth) or the Dragon's Breath (it's kind of more a dry heat without as much flavor as you'd hope for)."
30,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,9/16/2021,"It's not easy finding vegan ramen, so this place is special! Located on Newbury street and down some steps, this quaint little shop has a variety of ramen options. You enter inside, order, and pay upfront. Then, they either call your name or bring your order out to you. There is intimate indoor seating and some outdoor seating too. The cashier was awesome. Very quick to give recommendations based on our preferences and very funny as well. I ordered the Masterpiece because he gave a convincing pitch for it. It was great! Good contrast of veggies and noodles, and the broth tasted solid too. Not very photogenic, but the flavor made up for it. As a non-vegan, I still enjoyed it thoroughly. Would definitely come here again!"
31,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,10/21/2021,"Stunning VEGAN ramen and rice bowls 

I tried the King and Queen (truffle flavor) ramen and highly recommend! 

The broth is rich. Noodles chewy. Toppings (corn, mushrooms, spinach, and tofu) filling. Did I mention it is Vegan?? Which I am not..  but it is lovely to see delicious meat- free options."
32,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,3/19/2022,"Loved the dragon breath soup, dined in, I have found my comfort food in Boston, this was my first visit at a vegan Japanese restaurant. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu while I am in Boston"
33,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,3/28/2021,"Firstly, I really appreciate the fact that this restaurant's entire menu is vegetarian. It makes dining out very easy especially when people have different dietary restrictions in a friend group. 

My boyfriend and I tried the Sapporo Ramen and the Dragon Breath Ramen. Between the two I definitely preferred the Sapporo Ramen. I found the broth with the mix of the ingredients worked well in this bowl, whereas I didn't find that the spice in the Dragon Breath Bowl was fully incorporated in the broth. I enjoyed the flavor of the Sapporo Ramen and especially liked the chewy texture of the noodles. 

I would love to come back and try some of their other options!"
34,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,12/10/2021,Working in the city and I was craving ramen. This restaurant came up and I decided to check it out. From the time I walked in the service was great! I told them it was my first time and they took me through the menu and flavors and customer favorites. The first bowl I got was the Masterpiece and boy was it delicious! I was in heaven. Portion size was amazing too. Before I left I got my husband a bowl of the dragons breath which we ate later that night. Wow spicy but oh so good. A must try when in Boston.
35,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,3/13/2022,"If you are vegan or vegetarian, you will definitely appreciate the delicious ramen at Red White, but even if you are not, try it! The aromatic, spicy umami of the Tokyo ramen won over the meat eater among us. Those in our party who went for traditional Sapporo ramen were also pleased. The service is speedy and friendly. The owner and staff are so nice and they have cheerfully decorated the lower-floor restaurant in Japanese murals and origami paper. We got take out this time and it was nice and hot and very carefully packed."
36,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,2/20/2022,"tastes like vegan ramen

Came here with the vegetarian friend although I am not vegan myself, we thought it would be interesting to try out. I was skeptical because I feel that the rich pork broth in traditional ramen would be difficult (or perhaps impossible to replace). I am a big fan of umami flavors so I got the King&Queen with extra noodles (because I was super hungry that day). First off, I was blown away on how packed the ramen was - the bowl must have weighed over a pound. A ton of food. Def didn't need to get the extra noodles haha. The ramen itself was okay. Unfortunately, I did not like the broth that much but this may be because I am so used to pork broth. The saltiness is the first thing that hits you but there was no richness to back it up. Tasted similar to instant ramen broth. The noodles were also disappointing. They were very soggy (whereas I like the ramen noodles that are slippery and pick up the broth flavor on the outside while maintaining their integrity). Overall, it was an interesting ramen experience but not my cup of tea. I guess it is a decent alternative to traditional ramen, especially to those with dietary restrictions. But head to head, it does not compare.

We also got the miso avocado appetizer and it was underwhelming as well. Tasted exactly what it looks like - super concentrated miso (very salty) on top of avocado. When miso is served this concentrated, it has a funk to it that I did not like."
37,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,12/28/2021,"This vegan Ramen spot in Boston is incredible!
The flavors were absolutely delicious, the concept is forward and sustainable, and I'm telling you this place is a must!
We got: 
-Masterpiece Ramen
-Buddha Rice 
-Roasted Miso Avocado- one of the best things I've tasted! 

I can't wait to go back! And what a  great location- right on Newbury street!"
38,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,7/5/2021,"For vegan ramen, this place was pretty good. I got the dragon breath regular ramen and it came out to be around $13. For spice level, I didn't think it was that spicy but the flavor was good. It came with spinach, corn, and mushrooms on top. The tofu was kind of crumbled into the soup which was a little strange, and there was also a little bit of other fake meat in the soup. Overall, portion size was filling and came hot! This is more of a fast service place where you place an order with the cashier then pick it up when it's ready and sit down. Definitely doesn't taste like classic pork ramen but hit the spot on a rainy day."

The service was great. Everyone was extremely nice and attentive. The decorations were simple and cute. The ramen was VERY flavorful and a perfect portion of everything. Would definitely come back here again!"
40,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,11/29/2021,"I really really wanted a bowl of ramen after reading reviews about this place. I was so delighted to learn they had a gluten-free Ramen option! Unfortunately I am allergic to fructans, so no garlic or onions for me either. Sadly the Ramen broth contains garlic. I was thankful that there was one entrée option to suit my dietary restrictions. The sushi rice wine bowl from the photograph looked like it was packed full of delicious veggies. Unfortunately when I got it back to my hotel it was mostly rice, kale and ginger, there were two cherry tomato halves in the entire bowl. The miso avocado was tasty, but the bowl just lacked pizzaz, especially for the $12 price. 
The service was fast and friendly, and the location convenient."
41,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/1/2021,"I'm not a ramen connoisseur, but I am vegan, which makes me 50% representative of Red White's demographic. With that grain of salt, this was really, really good ramen. It wasn't overly salty or flavorless like other reviewers said, but rich, savory, and creamy (I got the sesame one). The vegetables tasted fresh and the noodles were hearty, but not overwhelming. It struck that perfect balance between comfort food and healthy food. Great value for price, too - it came in a really big container."
42,RED WHITE RAMEN,1 star rating,11/9/2021,"I got the special dragon breath ramen which, according to the employees, ""a little spicier"".  They clearly had no idea what they were saying because It was WAY too spicy, to the point it's not edible.  It was also very bitter, like soap. Had to throw out the whole thing.

At first this place was run by people who clearly cared about the restaurant- very friendly and knowledgeable, etc.  Sad to see this place deteriorate already in terms of service and quality."
43,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/8/2021,"THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD.
Vegan and gluten free ramen options...unheard of, and then for it to be this good? Unreal.
Try the miso avocado too!
Great service, super nice folks
They package SO WELL for takeout."
44,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,1/30/2021,"My favorite spot in Boston! Love their tasty ramen and rice bowls. My favorite are mix well ramen and Buddha rice bowl. Super delicious and healthy. The Buddha rice bowl literally comes with  over 8 ingredients. Mix it up with their seaweed sauce, divine. 

I often come here to pickup the ramen to go. Eaten here during my first time with a friend and my husband. I've been back here over a dozen times and it's always super simple and quick to pickup. The staff are super friendly on top of the yummy vegan food."
45,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,2/16/2021,"I'd highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a quick bowl of ramen in Back Bay. They have a small indoor seating section with socially distanced tables. The staff were extremely friendly, and I was served in under 10 minutes!

I had the Dragon Breath Ramen, which was amazing. A bit on the spicier side, but this was perfect for me. The noodles had a good bite, and although I don't usually eat vegetarian I didn't miss the meat here one bit. The broth is star of the show here though, and I could've drank a bowl of that on its own!"
46,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,9/25/2021,"Ramen is a favorite, and so i wanted to see what they had to offer.  They have a different style, so if you are looking for  traditional, this may not be the place.  The food is still good and the server - Louis, was super friendly."
47,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,9/9/2021,"My friends and I were looking for a good ramen place in Boston and found this restaurant. I tried the Dragon Breath and it was a solid ramen. The broth was full of flavor and there was a good kick of spice. It's disappointing when a restaurant advertises a ""spicy"" dish, but it doesn't end up being spicy. However, the Dragon's Breath offers a flavorful spice; it's not spicy enough that you'll need to run to get some milk, but an enjoyable spice. I was hesitant at first when I saw the ramen since it came in togo containers, but the ramen was still steaming hot and delicious when I ate it. The noodles were firm with a nice bounce to it. There wasn't much toppings, but I didn't mind since the noodles with the broth tasted so good. I would definitely recommend trying this place if you're looking for some ramen."
48,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,9/6/2021,"my friends and i decided to stop by this place yesterday for lunch and we had a great time! this restaurant is relatively small and located underneath some steps, so they're quite easy to miss if you're just walking by.
-you can order for delivery or pick up through their website.
-there were a couple of tables set up outside on the street. the inside of the restaurant has about 5 small tables, 3 medium tables, and one long table (that's enough to fit 4 people). 
-you order at the cashier and pay right away. afterward, you go to pick up the food when they call your name. we waited around 10 minutes on line to order and then another 15 minutes for our food to be made. 
-the service here is great! the staff are super hardworking and they're open to giving recommendations/a run down of their relatively small menu.
-both cash and card payments are accepted.

9/5/21
-buddha rice: this bowl comes with white rice, black rice, quinoa, black beans, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, cherry tomatoes, tofu, vegan meat, mushrooms, corn, kale, pickled ginger, sunflower seeds, and roasted miso avocado. you can get the roasted miso avocado for an extra ~$5 on other dishes, but it comes free of charge for the buddha rice. i loved how balanced the meal was, and it was very filling as well. the roasted miso added an amazing flavor profile, and i enjoyed it a lot. my only complaint is that it started to taste too salty halfway through. this costed $12.79 including tax, which i thought was quite fair. it's not something that i would order again in the future, but i was really glad that i had decided to get this. (4/5)

overall, this place definitely deserves more hype, especially for their rice bowls! however, i'm not sure if i would come back in the future unless they added more options on their menu.
i would highly recommend that you must try their buddha rice with roasted miso avocado."
49,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,3/18/2022,"I ordered the curry masala ramen, it was so good. They made sure it wasn't as spicy which made it easier for me to eat. The broth was so rich in flavor. The noodles could have been softer but it was fine. I'm not vegan but I loved it! Would def recommend"
50,RED WHITE RAMEN,1 star rating,4/2/2022,"you can literally make your own instant noodles that taste better than this. the paper cups dont allow for the noodles to fully absorb the soup, way to overcrowded i felt like i needed to poke and dig up my noodles. there are def better options nearby"
51,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"Vegan ramen FTW! This place is really great. They have a modest menu with like six different types of ramen along with a rice bowl option. My wife had the miso ramen while I had the dragon's breath. Both were awesome.

Even better since my wife is gluten free, they are very well versed in allergy issues and they were able to sub rice noodles for the regular ones. The soup bases and topping are all gluten free too, so she could have a very close to ""normal"" experience. 

We didn't love the rice bowl and won't order that again, but we'll definitely be back soon when the craving hits again."
52,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,6/26/2021,"When Red White first opened I was not a fan. They definitely took a hard look at what they were doing, what was already out there, and what they could offer. And I'm blown away by what they came up with. 

Tried them for the first time the other day. I had the Mix Well (the no broth ramen) and my wife got the Sapporo Buddha. Everything about it was perfect. Simple but really tasty mix of textures and flavors. They even separate the ingredients from the broth for takeout so nothing gets soggy in transit. 

Just thank you so much to the RW team for adding this to the Boston vegan space. This immediately vaults into one of my favorite restaurants in the city."
53,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,6/22/2021,"Left P town in the cape early because of the weather. With it being rainy I decided to go to Boston to go on a little ramen spree (3 places in the day)

Met up with a friend who got there after us and told me that he was vegan so he wanted to show me this place. I've never been vegetarian or vegan and certainly never had vegan ramen so I was skeptical but boy was I wrong! 

I got the dragons breath (crushed it, broth and all) and my wife got the truffle ramen ans almost ate all of hers! (She never does that) 

Service was amazing the only thing I wish was that there was beer (maybe next time!)"
54,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,12/19/2020,"We stopped here for a quick bite prior to catching a train back to DC since it was close to our hotel. Despite my skepticism re: vegan ramen, I was pleasantly surprised. The broth was flavorful and the tofu + veggie combo (believe I got the Sapporo) was hearty enough for this meat loving girl. One of my dining partners was a vegetarian, so she was particularly impressed. The interior is cute but seating is pretty limited. Pricing wise, about on par with normal ramen ( $10-11) which can feel a tad expensive sans meat. That being said, certainly worth it for those who wouldn't otherwise get to enjoy a typical bowl of ramen. I think this place could do really well in D.C!"
55,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,6/15/2021,"Sweetest staff and delicious vegan ramen!!! Couldn't be happier! The miso ramen is my favorite, would honestly be happy eating this every day. Their menu is a little limited, but I've been happy with all their ramens!"
56,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,1/2/2022,So good! Huge portions! So tasty - worth the money. Definitely have a bunch of options for flavors and love the variety
57,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,11/30/2021,This is my favorite ramen spot in Boston hands down! My roommate and I get takeout at least once a week and always get the same thing: the King &. Queen (truffle flavor) and the Tokyo Masala (curry flavor) with chili oil and extra noodles on the side. I've also tried every other flavor on the menu and they're all amazing. Would give this place 10 stars if I could. I love you Red White
58,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,5/6/2021,"Has indoor (3 tables + counter seating) and outdoor seating (2 tables)! Lovely decor inside and great service. At the staff's recommendation, I got the new flavor of curry masala, which was creamy and slightly spicy from the chili oil. Could definitely taste the curry flavor, and the vegan toppings were super fresh! I admit to not being the biggest mushroom fan, but felt here that the umami they brought was very good. Definitely recommend coming here, especially if you want an affordable meal (~11 dollars!)."
59,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/30/2020,"All vegan ramen?! Sign me up! Yes this place is beyond worth traveling out of state for. Multiple times.
No place like this exists by us in RI especially not all vegan ramen.

The store is smaller due to being on Newbury but that doesnt stop the big bold flavors this place produces. Everytime we go in the staff is so friendly and BEYOND helpful.

They have about 6 or 7 vegans ramen to choose from. You can edit what you want in it because it's made from scratch. I always get tofu, corn and noodles.

PRO TIP: ALWAYSSSS ORDER EXTRA NOODS. IF YOU PAY FOR EXTRA GUAC AT PLACES, YOU SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM PAYING FOR EXTRA NOODS.

Their green tea is soooo good. You can tell its fresh because the tea leaves are still floating about. I love the authenticity. So with the ramen being a great price with the green tea is a perfect combo."
60,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,8/12/2021,"Not quite sure why this place received 4.5 stars. It's definitely not above average. The place looks more like a pick up and go kinda spot. V utilitarian. 

I ordered the King & Queen, which is a truffle salt flavor. The soup base lacked the usual umami, toppings were mediocre, and the ramen texture was a little too chewy. 

Should have realized when I saw the price point ($12 for a bowl of ramen). If we used Ipuddo as a comparison, RWBR is clearly a 3, tops."
61,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,7/28/2021,"My dad and I stopped in after attending a Red Sox game and we couldnt be more happy with our food. 

Neither of us had ever had a real vegan meal, and I was slightly terrified my dad would hate it. Man were we wrong. The food was absolutely delicious, the service was great, and I already cant wait to go back. 

If you like spicy, certainly try the spicy ramen. It had a kick, but also tons of flavor. HIGHLY recommended!"
62,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,11/20/2020,"This is an awesome place. The dish is absolutely phenomenal and delicious. The atmosphere and restaurant has so many nice decorations. 
We had a great time here, definitely recommend and will be back. 
Tok, the owner is very respectful, kind and sweet to his clients!!! 

FREE DELIVERY AROUND BACKBAY too!!!!"
63,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,10/22/2020,"As a non-vegan, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the Dragon Breath Ramen.  Definitely  cured my ramen fix- the broth was spicy enough to feel it but not enough to be overwhelmed.  I also have a very high spice tolerance, so I'd recommend avoiding this flavor unless you can handle spice.  The ingredients were very simple yet complemented each other very nicely.  Not earth-shattering level ramen, but very good considering.

The environment inside the restaurant is really cute and the workers there were very welcoming and accommodating.  Definitely will go again to try the Red Rice bowls they have- all in all a great experience!"
64,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,11/6/2021,"Just...can't...find...decent...food...in BOS.  I gotta be doing something wrong.

Blah...  King & Queen truffle salt broth was thin and boring (truffle?  This ain't no truffle).  No depth of flavor.  The artificial meat in the ramen disintegrated so it wasn't really satisfying.

This place is vegan.  I sure wish there was something highlighting that fact before I went there.  It appeared to me online as a standard ramen joint - not a vegan / vegetarian ramen place.  I respect vegans deeply but this particular food is just not that good.  It was not terrible but it was not good, either.

For the price charged I was expecting quite a bit more.

Oh, and the big no no:  don't prompt me for a tip when there is no service.  You order at the counter, pick up at the counter, and bus your own table.  There is NO service.  Tips are for service, they are not a handout, millennials.  No tip was paid.  No tip was deserved.  I will not be back and - this - put a cap on it."
65,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/11/2020,"I was walking on Newbury Street and was caught by the Dragon Breath Ramen sign outside of their restaurant. I love spicy food and ramen so thought I'd give it a try (lol did not realize it was vegan until I went in). The broth and noodles were very delicious and I did not feel bloated after eating it! The dragon breath ramen is prettyyyy spicy even with their regular spice level and I usually order extra spicy at other places, so just make sure to ask to lower the spice level if you think you can't handle it. 

The staff was friendly, welcoming, and put thoughts into making each bowl. They also have indoor/ outdoor seatings during COVID."
66,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,7/26/2021,"Omg! The food here is amazing!! 

I came across this place on Grubhub and decided to take a chance. It's safe to say that I will be ordering from here in the very near future!

Everything was well packed, flavorful and even still hot when it arrived. 

10 out of 10! Highly recommend!!"
67,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,4/30/2021,"My husband and I got 2 different ramens and they were both suuuuuper delicious!! I wasn't too sure about vegan ramen but OMG! So goood!
The staff were very nice and friendly :)"
68,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/20/2020,"I love Red White because its a great spot for broth-y vegan options. Their sauces are absolutely amazing and they have great toppings! I went for the Masterpiece which has vegan meat, and veggies which tastes like creamy sesame taste which totally translated. 

Can't wait to go back to try the other options especially with the weather cooling down and their amazing ramen bowl options :)"
69,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,11/8/2021,"Great little ramen shop.  Not a lot of choices, but makes it easier to decide.  Busy lunch business, but food comes out quickly.  Loved the Masterpiece special ramen."
70,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,3/16/2020,"I landed in Boston early for a weekend work trip and was working from the hotel in the morning, so I went out wandering to find a lunch spot. I came across Red White and was intrigued about the uniqueness of a fast-casual vegan Japanese bowl restaurant. 

I stopped in around 12:30ish and there were two Japanese guys manning the Chipotle-style counter of bases, toppings, etc. You can either get a soup bowl or a non-soup bowl with tofu, udon, or sushi rice. 

Food: 
- Humble Bowl (Monk Curry) - Broccoli, Tofu, Corn, Yam potatoes, Green peppers, Edamame, Kale, Arugula, Spinach, Monk curry sauce. I added the vegan spicy mayo on top as well. The bowl was so healthy, packed with very fresh veggies that were all seasoned well and prepared on their own. The scoop of monk curry was on top and had a lot of flavor. It was all very unique and only $10.95 for a whole bowl of fresh veggies! 

The cold green tea was super legit and strong, I would recommend getting it if you like cold tea. 

Overall, super cool concept to have fast-casual Vegan restaurant in a cuisine which normally has a lot of fish and pork based foods. Definitely would recommend if you are looking to try something new and healthy!"
71,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,10/23/2021,"Small menu, tasty but not inspired. No toppings on dishes, everything is just mixed in, so does not feel like the ramen you might get at a high end/authentic ramen shop. One rice dish is available, again everything mixed in so impossible to make special requests. The menu is very small. But 4 stars because it's tasty and vegan."
72,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,11/15/2021,Ordered the Dragons Breath and it was amazing! It has quite a kick & the broth is rich. I can't wait to come back!
73,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,3/31/2021,"Fantastic broth and chewy, thick noodles! Please know that when they say the Dragon's Breath is spicy, they really mean it. I would've enjoyed the mushroom and tofu to be in bigger pieces (and perhaps more of it?) and the spinach to be slightly blanched. Since the broth wasn't piping hot the spinach couldn't cook through properly. I got the miso flavor and it was very tasty."
74,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,11/7/2021,The Dragon's Breath had shredded cheese in it...why?!?! This was a very unpleasant surprise as I did not see this in the description or pictures. The broth was good and flavorful in theory but the cheese really ruined everything. I strongly recommend keeping cheese out of ramen
75,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,11/2/2021,Not kid friendly. Poor quality utensils. Decent flavors in ramen. Wouldn't recommend.
76,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/5/2021,"Ramen was on point, service was great too. 

Super friendly environment and felt welcomed from the first step into the restaurant."

78,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/6/2021,Came to visit in with my husband and a friend. Everything was great!! It was more of an order and sit style with no server which usually isn't my preference but this was a great little ramen shop and we will be back.
79,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/14/2021,Still thinking about this ramen 2 weeks later. Broth was so good. I got the spicy dragon one and my bf got the truffled spiced one and both were amazing. Also the fact that everything on the menu is vegetarian makes it a good place for us so we have more options
80,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,2/8/2021,"My friend and I both got the dragons breath noodles. The packaging was ingenious (keeps the noodles from soaking in the broth for too long). For the diversity, my friend got ramen noodles & garlic chip add-ons and I got udon noodles & Japanese spicy powder. The garlic granules were excellent, however the powder did not do much to add to the spice. But the spice level was still respectable and cough-inducing. I was a fan of the udon and the portions were large. I think my friend also enjoyed hers since she needed to lie down on the floor for a while. This place has earned a vegan seal of approval!"
81,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,11/20/2021,Very good gluten free ramen. We chose the delivery option and went smoothly. It arrived on time. Still very hot

83,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,11/7/2021,"I've been meaning to try Red White for over a year since reading about it on all the lists of ""best vegetarian food in Boston."" I happened to be in the area today and decided to pop in for lunch. I got the Masterpiece (""Classic Sesame Flavor""). It came with corn, spinach, mushrooms, and tofu. While it's definitely one of the better ramens I've had since going vegetarian, it was far too salty for my taste. I polished off my 40 oz water bottle while I had the one bowl of ramen.

Customer service was excellent, and the interior was clean and nicely decorated. The food just wasn't to my taste."
84,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,2/29/2020,"This is a small basement dwelling that is brightly decorated with a nice, hand painted Asian feel. It's order at the kitchen fast food style but the food is much better. While there's no table service, the kitchen staff are super friendly, will greet you and guide you through the process if you're obviously a newly.

The ""process"" is navigating the main board of build-your-own bowls and broths. Lots of choices but the board guides you through it. I was initially disappointed as I went in for Ramen but then I notice a hand written sign for ramen stuck to the kitchen counter. I'm guessing it's not their forte but I ordered it anyway.

The bowl was really good, nice toppings and a flavourful broth. I think it was a miso base as it lacked the creamy goodness of my beloved tonkotsu style. But none the less, excellent, check out my photo.

I think I'll try a broth next time, ""stick with what they know"", but their ramen is pretty good too."
85,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,8/10/2021,The noodles is chewy and has texture. I love that. The soup is creamy and flavorful. I definitely recommend my veggie friends to visit here
86,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,1/11/2022,"I had given up on vegetarian/vegan ramen but Red White changed my mind. We ordered the Dragon Breath and King & Queen and both were amazing. Great broths, noodles, flavors and toppings. Highly recommended, we look forward to ordering again!"

Service 5/5
Our waiter was great. He was very knowledgeable, was walking around to constantly make sure we were ok, and overall provided great service.

Drinks 5/5
A few of us got drinks and each of us loved them. The table favorite was the honey do drink which was sooo delicious.

Food 5/5
My friends and I split a bunch of my things. The Mac and cheese is so good I get it everytime. The burger and chicken sliders have wonderful flavor. They're known for their chicken so you can't go wrong. The biscuits are so sweet and salty with delicious cheese and cinnamon butter dips. Everything is good. For dessert they had the greatest cappuccino ice cream, beignets, and bread pudding. The only thing we weren't completely sold on was the cast iron Brie. It was good, but I probably wouldn't get it again.

You can't go wrong @ B&B. If you're looking for a nice place to go in boston, it's always an option.

1,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/19/2022,"Took a solo trip to Boston and was so glad this spot made the list. I'm only sad that I didn't have a partner to split more dishes with me or a larger stomach!

I was able to walk in and grab a spot on a ledge near the bar as a single patron for dinner.

I was able to try the Honey glazed biscuits with the cheese spread (warm, delicious, both savory and sweet and pairs incredibly well with the pimento cheese) as well as the wings (sweet and spicy). The wings were phenomenal with the perfect crunch and coating to compliment the succulent wing meat. 

I wish I could remember the cocktail I ordered, but I remember it being quite delicious but also strong!

Service was good! Even though I was a single diner, I still felt very attended to. 

Ambiance was dark, sexy and intimate at dinner. The space had great energy and I really liked the feel and set up of the restaurant. 

Next time I'm up in Boston I'm definitely coming by to try some more items. 

4.8/5"
2,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/11/2022,"Lately I've taken another look at Buttermilk and Bourbon and I definitely believe they have come back to their original quality. Last few times I went the service has been impeccable and I've been loving the new menu options.

Would recommend as a cool cocktail lounge for friends or a delicious meal with family or significant other."
3,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,3/4/2022,"I think this place is a bit overrated despite its numerous reviews on Google. We booked a reservation on Open Table but the only available tables were outside. We arrived to find heat lamps present outside but not switched on and without any exterior lighting. Clearly there was no way we could feasibly sit outside in the dark in Boston cold weather, especially when heat lamps present weren't even turned out, but this is what was initially offered (??). We declined. Thankfully they were able to accommodate us inside. 

This place gets packed and pretty noisy. All the dishes are small and are tapas style.  We tried some raw oysters, the rainbow trout, biscuits, and wild boar chili. The rainbow trout and the biscuits stood out to me the most. To be frank, I couldn't tell the difference between wild boar meat and ground beef. The oysters didn't taste very fresh. If you plan to come, make sure you make a reservation but I didn't find my experience that remarkable."
4,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,2/12/2022,"Charming and vibrant with dim lighting. The ambiance has a touch of New Orlean's French Quarter charm.

ORDERED:
Grilled Octopus: it was delicious. Very tender and meaty. The combination of white bean purée, arugula, fennel, vinaigrette, and orange pieces was very well balanced and flavorful.

Honey Do Cocktail: it tasted like piña colada with a slice of grilled pineapple on top.

Overall, the octopus and the drinks were very good. Will definitely be back another time."
5,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,1/27/2022,"Buttermilk and bourbon is located in a basement about two blocks from Newbury street. I had a little trouble finding it but once I did, I was in for a delight! They were packed around 4:00pm on Saturday so I sat at the bar. I ordered the warm honey glazed biscuit, chicken wings with white bbq sauce, and 2 fried chicken sliders. 

Warm Honey Glazed Biscuit: this has to be the best biscuit I've had. The cinnamon butter paired with the biscuit was the perfect combination. The biscuit is warm, fluffy, and moist. I actually took it with me on a flight and ate it three days later, and it was still just as good. 

Chicken wings: I thought it was better without the bbq white sauce but still good nonetheless. I would say there wasn't anything super special about the chicken, but it's still good. 

2 fried chicken sliders: a must get. The chicken is tender and the brioche bun was perfect with it. 

Overall: I ordered a little too much for one person haha but everything was divine. I would come again on a weekday when it's a little less busy to experience the dining room. Definitely get the warm honey glazed biscuit."
6,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,2/27/2022,"If you are looking for southern hospitality in Boston, then you have come to the right place! Buttermilk & Bourbon services southern styled food, which reflects richness of flavor and history -- in the form of --fried crispy goodness. Almost every item on the menu was heavy/fried. My stomach was a bit sensitive, so I decided to order a couple ginger-ales and  I could not resist the decedent banana biscuit bread pudding. It was a shareable size and tasted divine! Our server was super friendly and accommodating to our large party."
7,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,12/8/2021,"Very good for the hype! I think I was putting off trying this place assuming it was hyped up, but the food is pretty good. We came for dinner on a Tuesday and it was busy so would recommend a reservation. 
For drinks, I had the A-wassalling which was a warm cocktail. Good flavor and satisfied my craving for a warm drink on a cold day. 
For food, we ordered the 1/2 fried chicken which was very crispy and moist on the inside. It wasn't the best fried chicken I've ever had, but definitely up there. I liked that the breading wasn't too heavy. The biscuits were SO good, so warm on the inside and caramelized with honey on the outside. Also had the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp which was also great. I love anything with grits! The Wild Boar Chili was also decent, but nothing too special."
8,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,1/9/2022,"Wanted to try out Buttermilk & Bourbon after seeing the high reviews. We were visiting Boston for a weekend trip and decided to try it out for dinner. It's tapas/small plates style and our waiter suggested 2-3 dishes for a party of 2. We went with the garlic herb Mac and cheese (comes with short rib), Nashville hot chicken wings, and 2 prime burger sliders. 

Out of the 3, the best dish was the Mac and cheese. It truly had a unique taste and the rib was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The wings and sliders were good but honestly nothing special. Ordering 3 dishes was definitely filling enough. It was the perfect amount without feeling stuffed. Our food came out quick and fresh from the kitchen which was a plus. We came right when they opened which may have helped since I know it's a popular place. Make sure to reserve a table ahead of time."
9,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/5/2022,"Had dinner here on a Wednesday night and it was packed! This has got to be one of the most delicious places I've eaten at in Boston. I came here with a friend and ordered 3 plates, and left overwhelmingly full. We ordered the fried chicken, warm honey glazed biscuits, and garlic mac and cheese. The service was very friendly, and the food came promptly. The biscuits were dense and sweet. The chicken was tender and flavorful, but not as special as the other dishes. The mac and cheese has to be my favorite! It was very unique in flavor and addicting to eat. I can't wait to try other kinds of food here next time, if I don't reorder the biscuits and mac and cheese again."
10,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"YUM!! Took me forever for me to get a weekend brunch reservation but so glad I did and well worth the wait and hype! Hip-cajun decor and southern/cajun inspired dishes. The soft serve mimosas are fun and tasty, definitely worth a try! The fried chicken and waffles were crispy on the outside, soft and steamy on the inside, and came with a side of watermelon which was unconventional but provided good balance to the meal.

The deviled eggs were piled high with tasty garnishes and were a good addition to the meal (although probably not the star).

The pulled pork benedict was really tasty--savory and sweet meat, the hollandaise was hollan-dank, and it was topped with a crispy fried egg instead of the traditional poached.

It's a must do for your Boston brunch bucket list!!"

Just come here and order everything on the menu lol. The Mac and cheese, fried chicken sandwich, alligator fries, Brussel sprouts, and THE BISCUITS were to die for. Cocktails were good too. Great service, loved the small shareable plates and very cool vibe inside. You have to try it."
12,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,2/11/2022,"Enjoyable cocktails, delicious octopus. 

Stopped by for drinks and a snack. Atmosphere was trendy and casual, with lots of little spaces to sit down for a drink.  Every menu seemingly needs to have octopus now, but hey, when it's good it's great and the one here was fantastic. Super meaty, super tender, great flavor that was well balanced by the various garnishes. I remember enjoying my drink, but I don't remember exactly what I ordered. The octopus took up too much mental bandwidth. 

I'd certainly come back to try more food."
13,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,4/4/2022,Came here while on vacation in boston. Oysters so fresh you can taste the sea. Everything on the menu is great as well as the cocktails (strong and beautiful). Will definitely come back again next time I'm in town.(4 stars bc no ac just fan and it was hot and humid)
14,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,4/10/2022,I got the sliders but I wish I had gotten the fried chicken (I tried it fortunately!) Great run based cocktails and the most delicious biscuit ever. Try it if you are in Boston!
15,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,4/8/2022,"With reservations booked out a whole month out, we decided to try walking in at 11:45 AM on a Saturday  morning. It was definitely already busy and no tables were available. But we were able to get a spot along the wall at the high tables and chairs for two, in between a few people. We were greeted within a few minutes by our waitress with some waters and menus. We ordered the WARM HONEY GLAZED BISCUITS with smoked cinnamon butter & pimento cheese spread. The biscuits were delicious with bits of salt on them. The spreads gave us a sweet and savory option. For the main course, we ordered the HOUSE SPECIAL - BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN and waffles with Nashville hot, sweet & spicy, BBQ syrup as well as watermelon. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the waffles had peppers baked in. The watermelon was a nice refresher. We really wanted the FRESH FRIED BEIGNETS With Powdered sugar and chocolate, but we were too full. We will definitely be back for them. Highly recommend Buttermilk and Bourbon and make sure to reserve in advance."
16,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/27/2022,"First, I have to complement the staff. The host & waitstaff were extremely Friendly & helpful.  The food was phenomenal. The sauces for the cocktails were perfect. The cocktail sauce had the perfect blend of heat and smokeyness. The low country scramble looked small, but it was very filling. The grits were cooked to perfection & the sausage was excellent."
17,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,11/9/2021,"It was phenomenal. We loved it. 

stopped by with my wife and son. brie, mac n cheese, étouffée,  honey glaze salted biscuits. sliders. sprouts yea, lots of doggie bags

solid service and amazing food. made with love

bravo"
18,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,1/17/2022,"We ordered some drinks for brunch which were good! For food we got the honey biscuits, fried chicken and mac n' cheese. We liked all items ordered and were well satisfied. Three items was more than enough for us and the waitress said it was ""tapas style"" so we could order ser more. But we couldn't even make it through the three things we got."
19,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,1/10/2022,"(Last visited 4/28/2021.) Working in Boston for the week and a young lady at the hotel I'm staying at HIGHLY recommended this place so I had to check it out!

Atmosphere/Appearance: Set below street level on the corner of Commonwealth Avenue and Dartmouth Street is this beautiful gem. It was raining this evening so the outdoor seating section was pretty much closed off except for the few people that were sitting out there before the rain started. By the way, I HIGHLY recommend making reservations for this place because I couldn't get a seat until 9:30pm because I hadn't made reservations. Lol. Once in the front door it feels just a bit cramped, but once you make a left into the dining area or a right into the bar area the space certainly opens up. Now, I've never been to New Orleans, but I got a ""New Orleans"" feel from the restaurant. Lol. The dining room is decorated like an old mansion with lots of antiques in interesting wallpaper. The bar area is decorated similarly with a ominous purple glow. Very, very suave.

Service: Evan took care of me and he was awesome. He was quick, patient and made sure that I had everything that I needed.

Food: So Vallette (the young lady from the hotel) told me I had to try several things and since she's a native of the area, I trusted her. Here goes! I started off with a B & B Flight which comes with my choice of 3 bourbons from a select list. For an appetizer I went with a couple of their ""Lemon Shandy Peel & Eat Shrimp"". These shrimp were huge, of course still in their shells, but they peeled away quite nicely and are served with a cocktail sauce as well as like a... garlic-y, creamy, delicious sauce. Nicely done. After that I tried out their alligator fries! Just the fact that I'm able to try out alligator all the way in Boston is what sold me on these! The fries came out LOADED. The fries were crispy, well-seasoned then topped with breaded alligator nuggets, a few pickles, a creamy/spicy cajun sauce and chives. I told you it was loaded. Lol. These were delicious, but quite salty if I must say. Still very good how all of the flavors came together. The alligator itself was tender, crispy and had a very distinct taste that's hard to describe. The fries beneath all the madness helped cut all of the savory-ness of the other ingredients. For my entrée  I decided to go with special on the menu, the Cajun swordfish with asparagus. It was FANTASTIC. I loved every bite of it. There was a lil' bit of charring on the skin which gave the fish a lovely texture as you chewed. There was this, heavenly sauce made of angel tears that was served on the side that just went SO WELL with this dish. My goodness. As a bonus the kitchen sent out an order or authentic beignets. I had no more room for food, but because these delicacies are so soft, airy and fluffy, it made them so easy to stuff down! They were so soft, hot and deliciously sweet. I had never had a beignet before, but I'm a believer now!

Value:
B & B Flight = $16.00
Lemon Shandy Peel & Eat Shrimp = $4.50/each
Alligator Fries = $14.00
Swordfish = $15.00
Fresh Fried Beignets = $10.00 w/Chocolate = $11.00 /A La Mode = $12.00
This place isn't cheap, but it shouldn't be! The quality of the food was fantastic, the portions were good, the atmosphere was pleasant and everything was just grand. I can't wait to pay this place another visit!

20,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,1/4/2022,"I've been lamenting not having many good brunch places in Boston area until B&B.  It took a month ahead for the reservation but it was worth it!  Very welcoming and friendly service here. 

For 3 people, we ordered 7 dishes + coffee.  Every single dish was a big bang in flavors!  Prices were actually very reasonable for being in the Copley area with the big tapas portions.  
_Biscuit was moist and wonderful w/ the  cinnamon whipped butter
_Alligator fries were juicy and perfect - soooo good!
_Beans and arugula salad was refreshing
_Banana French Toast was rich and creamy- gone in 10 mins. LOL
_Fried Chicken and waffle were moist, perfectly fried, watermelon side was a good touch.
_Duck Confit w/ sunny side up eggs was pretty and tasty, but the toast underneath was burnt, this can be improved. 
_Jalepenos hush puppies were delicious - this place gets it right!

We love the funky voodoo ambiance!  Definitely a fun place to brunch w/ family and friends.  Highly recommend!

My brother love the spicy alligator sauce so much that he rub the slab of left over fried chicken in the iron pan."
21,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,3/17/2022,"We came here as a pre-game spot before heading to the house of blues for a concert. The hostesses weren't very friendly AT ALL but I'll focus on the food for the purpose of this review, which was amazing! And our waiter was great as well. He came over and gave us the lay of the land, how the food is basically tapas style so be prepared to order a few and share. The food came out hot and freshly prepared. We sat in the lounge area which was very intimate and maybe not so good, made me feel comfortable enough to take a nap after I ate Haaha, though I didn't. I think my favorite was definitely the Alligator Fries. Ooooh and those biscuits!!!! Just enough softness, a tad bit of crunch and that sweet butter to top it off! The drinks had such a pleasing taste and were pretty to look at too. You can make a reservation and it's probably recommended on most days. We went when they first opened on a Wednesday so we were able to be seated. Will definitely return on another Boston visit"
22,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,9/25/2021,"Tried Buttermilk & Bourbon for an early dinner. This place is very difficult to reserve for weekend brunch. We were told we need to reserve weeks in advance for brunch. Overall the food was good, depending on the dish. However, a bit overpriced for what you're getting.  Tapas-sized to medium sized portions. Probably to be expected for a place around Newbury Street. Pretty busy - if you're planning to visit, definitely make sure you have a reservation to save yourself some hassle. 

Food:
- Warm honey glazed biscuits: definitely recommend. Very flavorful and substantial. A step above the biscuits you would get at fast food breakfast places. You get 4, though I wish we had more spread. 
- 2 fried chicken sliders: definitely recommend. Medium-sized sandwiches, not teeny tiny sliders. Chicken was crunchy on the outside and not dry on the inside. Interesting combo of flavors in one bite. 
- Nashville hot alligator fries: skip. We tried for the novelty of the dish. The meat was dry. The fries were good. 
- pulled pork croquettes: definitely skip. Not memorable (sorry)

Atmosphere: Ample outdoor seating with umbrellas. The indoor seating has better atmosphere, but we preferred to dine outside during COVID. 

Service: Timely and professional. No complaints."
23,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,9/15/2021,"I see this place for brunch recommendations so it has been on my list for a very long time. There were no reservations for brunch on Saturday so my friend and I decided to walk in right when they opened. We were seated indoors promptly. It seems that they don't do brunch on Saturdays, only on Sundays. They did have a chicken and waffles special, but we were kind of disappointed that we didn't get to try the brunch. 

They don't do any modifications or single biscuits, so we had to order the full biscuit appetizer which came with 4-5 hot biscuits. I'm not complaining, those biscuits were the star of the meal! Hot, buttery with a cheese spread. For our mains we got the chicken and waffle special. It came with friend chicken and what seemed like cornbread shaped like a waffle. It also had watermelon and butter. The spicy glaze whose name I recall, I wish they had given us more of that, or drenched our fried chicken in it. 

Overall, even though there were no reservations, the place was not busy at all, lots of space available indoors and outdoors. Taking a star off because the food was mediocre, but the biscuits were fire!"
24,Buttermilk & Bourbon,2 star rating,10/14/2021,"We didn't have a reservation for lunch on a Thursday and were promptly seated if we could be done in one hour as they had reservations. No problem...

The lunch menu (compared to the brunch one we had tried before), was disappointing. We ordered the mushroom toast and the fried catfish. The catfish was great but the mushroom toast was too salty. The fish entree came first and I had to wait for 7-10 minutes for my mushroom toast to be ready!!!

When your server looks like he really doesn't want to be there, lacks energy and enthusiasm, it really doesn't make it pleasant!!!

I hoped for a lot better experience but they fell really short."
25,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,8/14/2021,"Dining at Buttermilk & Bourbon was probably one of my highlights visiting Boston! The food here is AMAZING! We were lucky enough to come without a reservation and be seated, but def make a reservation. It was packed on a Monday evening.

I highly recommend the biscuits! Those babies are so delicious. It comes with a side of cinnamon butter and pimento cheese. Pass on the pimento cheese lol. Our hot fried chicken was also really good. The chicken was actually hot and had a kick to it! My boyfriend also enjoyed his mushroom toast as well. 

The mac and cheese was a disappointment for us. It literally tasted like Kraft from the box. The mac and cheese wasn't baked long enough and had a weird consistency.

Other than that, everything else was great! Highly recommend if you're in Boston!"
26,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,2/21/2022,"Came here for dinner last week and was amazed! Everything was so delicious! I love how it's basically tapas, small plates. We are able to try so much more. Prices were reasonable. I particularly loved the biscuits. We also really enjoyed the prawn handpiepies, BBQ octopus, and shrimp cocktail."
27,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,12/23/2021,"I've heard so much hype surrounding Buttermilk & Bourbon - I knew I had to give it a try! I made a reservation for a Thursday evening at 5:30 for 2 people. When we arrived, I was surprised by how many open tables there were given the fact that reservations are so difficult to get. 

We ordered the Nashville alligator fries, warm honey glazed biscuits, and boneless fried thighs with sweet & spicy sauce since these seemed to be the most popular dishes. The alligator fries were definitely a novelty - I can now officially say that I've had alligator! The pieces of alligator basically tasted like fried chicken. If you want to say you've had alligator, then this dish is worth trying - or else, you wouldn't miss much by skipping this dish. The biscuits had a sweet honey crust on top and a dense inside. I wish the honey flavor covered more of the biscuit, since it was a little bland otherwise. I did like it with the cinnamon butter, and less so with the cheese spread. The chicken thighs were very moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. I wish I had asked for the sweet & spicy sauce on the side because I thought it was a bit too sour for my liking. Maybe one of the other sauces would have been a better match for me. 

Overall, we had a good experience. I feel like my expectations were sky-high due to all of the hype I've heard surrounding this place. As a result, the food didn't seem to meet my expectations and I was a tiny bit disappointed that I didn't like everything more. I think next time I'd want to try the chicken sliders and the beignets. Regardless, I still very much recommend Buttermilk & Bourbon if you want great Southern food!"
28,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"It took me a long time to actually get reservations here -- and the wait was worth it. Even packed on a Wednesday night, the space makes you almost feel like you're in a whole in the wall in NOLA instead of on comm Ave itself. The drinks were wonderful and the food was even better. The wild boar chili with cornbread dumplings will have me coming back again and again."
29,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,2/16/2022,"What a find! 

Loved this spot from top to bottom of my drink! Came across it online while travling in Boston and the name alone is what drew me in, but the ambiance, the bar area, the drink & brunch options, all were amazing! 

Sat by the bar with my buddy to grab brunch & drinks. I had gone with the bloody mary & swapped vodka for bourbon, which came out perfect! Did the same on the second drink, but they have a bloody mary option that comes with a jumbo shrimp as well, so I ordered that and even better! 

Shared the hushpuppies which was a perfect choice, loved that they had it on the menu, and they didn't have the benedict so I went with the duck confit on toast and again, just a delighful dish that I would gladly have again if I'm up in the area!"
30,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,8/8/2021,"We decided to go here for the Sunday brunch.  All of the reviews I read raved about the biscuits. The girls have been here recently and enjoyed it.

When we called they said they didn't have any empty tables, even though we were getting there just as they opened. They did say over the phone that we could sit at the bar .

When we arrived they were able to sit us outside which was perfect due to the weather being awesome.

We ordered right away and the staff was prompt to take our order. We started out with coffee and an order of biscuits (4). The reviews are right the biscuits are to die for. Crispy top and buttery flaky inside. 

Our daughter had ordered the mushroom hash, which was wild mushrooms sauteed with peppers and potatoes. With a side of thick cut bacon. This came out first not long after we ordered. This was good, the wild mushrooms were cooked and really mimicked  the meat that would normally be in a hash. This dish is a tad spicy.

Our other daughter ordered the french toast with a side of over med eggs. The french toast was incredible and came out about 10 minutes after the hash dish, but without the eggs.

We then sat for about 30 minutes watching many dishes come out and be delivered to tables around us. We finally inquired about our two plates of biscuits and sausage gravy with one side of grits. By this time my daughter had finished her hash and my wife and I had finished our coffee and mimosa's.

The manager said he would look into the delay and shortly my daughter's eggs were delivered even though her french toast was about consumed. Did want to eat them together but that didn't work out. The egg whites were a tad runny for her liking.

Our sausage gravy and biscuits finally came out 45 minutes after we ordered. The grits another 10 minutes after that. Not sure what happened but it seemed like our order was lost.

I will say I gave the 3 stars because the food was outstanding. The biscuits were just as the previous reviews had mentioned. I could have sat and just ate a bucket of them. The hash, french toast and plates of biscuits and gravy were scrumptious. The grits are jalapeno grits, very creamy and spicy. All and all I would come back for the food.

It's pricey and not sure what had happened to our order, but the waitress apologized for the delay, just wish the manager had come by to apologize as well.

It was a Sunday, so the onstreet parking was free if you were able to find a spot. The outside patio also was very nice."
31,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,6/30/2021,"I've been wanting to come here ever since moving from the Deep South to see what sort of southern food theyd be bringing up here. Came for a Sunday brunch and the food did not disappoint! 

I'd recommend definitely getting some biscuits for the table with honey butter and pimento cheese. Everything else we got was a great hit: grits and sausage, pork hash, and pulled pork Benedict. The blackened bloody Mary's and other cocktails were delicious and spicy. The slushee-style mimosa (?) looked interesting and would give it a go next time I come.

Apart from the food, however, the delivery and service was really inconsistent. I'd probably chalk it up to staffing issues since reopening, but it was pretty bad for us. I received my eggs about 15 minutes before the other dishes, so they were naturally cold when we all started eating. Biscuits came last, although I shouldn't complain too much since they were hot. In fairness, the server did tell us food would be delivered when ready, but timeliness (or lack thereof) did make the experience awkward and left a little to be desired."
32,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,7/4/2021,"I knew the food would be good, but I guess I was pleasantly surprised by the service with how many recent negative reviews I've seen regarding the service. Either that or I'm too used to hands off Chinatown waiters. Anyway, service wise, we were seated promptly since we had a reservation. Water and drinks were timely. No issues given that this place is super popular and they were busy. 

My friends got the Voodoo and a Bloody Mary. The frozen Voodoo (rose vodka, elderberry, strawberry, and lemon) was pretty good and a good amount of alcohol. The Bloody Mary seemed pretty heavy on the old bay. 

For the food, the got the warm honey glazed biscuits, the Nashville hot alligator fries, the chicken and waffles special, pulled pork Benedict and the low country scramble. The biscuits are a must. Like get it you have to. Super fluffy, sweet and salty. There isn't a more perfect carb out there. The alligator fries were good. Alligator has a pretty good kick to it. The pulled pork Benedict had really tender pulled pork the eggs kind of remind me of scotch eggs, except the middle is runny. The low country scramble was pretty good, the jalapeño grits were definitely a fav. 

Overall pretty decent brunch place to get together with friends now that we can all be out and about again. Food is good and portion sizes are pretty big. Plan accordingly!"
33,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,2/5/2022,"During the pandemic, it was so hard to find a place that still had brunch open for dine in seating and I'm so glad I discovered this place. 
One of the unique things about this place is that if you follow their IG, you'll notice the menu items change from time to time and I think that's pretty fun to follow. There's always going to be something new and interesting to try on the menu."
34,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,2/20/2022,Love. The. Biscuits. This place has the absolute best biscuits and just on that alone is why I would go out of my way to come here. I came with a couple of coworkers after work and we enjoyed ourselves. This place is definitely a place to dress casual and it's noisy.
35,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,11/12/2021,"This was a fun place, with good food and friendly service. 

Food: hushpuppies were excellent. Boar chili was good, and while the cornbread dumplings were great, the chili could be a lot more flavorful. Bread pudding made for a fun dessert, although it was a little dense (then again, it ~is~ bread pudding). 

Cocktails: Had the A-wassaling, which is gin, apple cider, lemon, and honey. Pretty good, but not that notable."
36,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,11/29/2021,I've been to this place twice and is now moving forward my restaurant of choice in Boston! Every plate that we ordered was delicious! My fav was the beignets. Def plan to come back!
37,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,5/3/2021,"A must go to for Sunday brunch! This restaurant is located in a great spot in Back Bay with such amazing New Orleans inspired food and ambiance. Their menu is so unique and unlike anywhere else in Boston, you cannot go wrong with what you order. 

I made a reservation for when my friend came to visit. You definitely need to make a reservation early on for weekend brunch, they fill up fast! I made the reservation before knowing the weather. At the time it was nice in Boston, so I made a reservation for outside. But of course on the day of it was quite cold out. They had a bunch of heaters outside so it wasn't bad at all. 

Since they're so busy on the weekends, the service was a little slow. But our waitress was so nice and kept apologizing. My friend and I didn't have anywhere to be so it was nice to hang out and chat for a while. 

The food was incredible! The Nashville alligator fries are a definite must! Never had alligator before but it was delicious! They have two options for biscuits, so of course we got both. But if you only want to order one, go for the honey biscuits! I'd love to go back for dinner and try more of their food!"
38,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,4/29/2021,"Finally got to try the famous B&B and it lived up to the hype. 

Warm Honey Glazed Biscuits ($14): these glorious biscuits are a must have here! I thought it would be too sweet for my taste based on the description but it wasnt that sweet at all! It has such a unique texture where its fluffy and slightly gritty like cornbread at the same time? It comes with smoked cinnamon butter and pimento cheese spread that has a bit of spice. I personally preferred the cinnamon butter that reminded me of the one at texas roadhouse (very different texture! less sweet and less cinnamonny)

Sweet and Spicy Chicken Wings ($12): the batter is perfectly crispy and the meat is super moist and juicy. It is not that spicy nor too sweet. Has LOTS of garlic flavor! 

Nashville Hot Alligator Fries ($14): surprisingly my favorite dish here! The fries were fried to perfection and the cajun spices added a nice kick. The queso and the comeback sauce added a nice cheesy and creamy component. The ALLIGATOR THOUGH was my favorite part. It really is alligator and it tasted like a mix of chicken and pork. It was super crispy and juicy. I devoured it!! 

Cant wait to go back and try some of their other dishes!!"
39,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"For drinks I got the hurricane and the frozen voodoo, and I really loved both. They were both fruity and refreshing, with just the right amount of sweetness. For entree I got the buttermilk fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce and the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was my absolute favorite. The short rib was very well cooked and the cheese was just lovely."
40,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/12/2022,"The food and drinks were amazing. My boyfriend is from the south and he is extremely critical of the southern food we make up north but he was blown away by the food, the biscuits especially. I think it made him happy to find a slice of home up here in Boston. It was a little loud, but the atmosphere was also great."
41,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,10/18/2021,"Definitely make sure to make reservations if you want to eat in this popular brunch spot! Plating for all the dishes was very nice, and there are lots of delicious options, so you can't go wrong! Of course, I had to try the chicken and waffles. The chicken was crunchy, and I was happy that it was boneless chicken (although bone-in chicken probably would have been more juicy). Not the best fried chicken I've ever had, but it was decent. Waffles were a little on the soggy side. Something unique here was the honey butter and the sweet and spicy sauce. I personally wasn't a fan of of the spicy sauce (would have preferred regular maple syrup), so I just used the delicious butter as the topping for the chicken and waffles. Overall, the meal satisfied my brunch cravings."
42,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,11/19/2021,"This was the perfect dinner for us after a long day of traveling to the East Coast. The restaurant has a very relaxed atmosphere, and the building is absolutely beautiful. We enjoyed some of their fried buttermilk chicken with sweet and spicy sauce, as well as their oysters and their mac & cheese."
43,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,6/26/2021,"Buttermilk and Bourbon had been on my list for forever, and I'm glad we finally got to go!

Needless to say, the Honey Biscuits are a MUST HAVE if you come here. My gosh, they are so good. I don't know if I've ever had a biscuit that's so good! You get 4 of them and they are a good size!

And the swordfish dish is amazing. I'm glad I saw other reviews that recommended it! The crab salad on the bottom is like a crab cake (and it's amazing!)

And wow, the wings are great too! Nice and crispy and the sweet and sour sauce is so delicious. Can't wait to try their other flavors. 

And the drinks were excellent and creative!

The beignets were decent. They could be a bit sweeter for my tastes, but their quality was nice and fresh. We got it a la mode and the ice cream was more like a froyo-style. I'm not a big froyo person so would have personally preferred regular ice cream. 

Definitely want to go back here soon and try more of their dishes!"
44,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,11/17/2021,"I had such high hopes for Buttermilk & Bourbon but it just didn't live up to the hype.  I stopped in for lunch--it was a little hard to find, given the construction, but I spotted a sign and stepped inside.  They didn't have any standard table seating, so I was brought to ""lounge"" style seating, which was couches and chairs--comfortable enough, but kind of a weird vibe since the tables were coffee-table height and not ultra suited to a meal.  I went with the sliders (nice, but a little greasy) and a side of non-alligator fries, which were somehow bland and unenjoyable.  Service was good, so maybe it was an off-day -- but I wouldn't make another special trip just to try it, given that the $14 sliders weren't enough for a meal without a side of $6 fries."
45,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"I've been here several times as am Jason Santos devotee and also cheering on Chef Julian's career. Recent favorites include the biscuits, hush puppies, roasted oysters (!!!! Get you some) and mac and cheese. My friends like the cocktail menu and I preferred a glass of albariño with my meal. 
Let me say a word about the staff. They are nice and helpful, prompt and efficient. I recently left my phone in the washroom and had to come back for it. They were busy trying to figure out how to message me about it when I showed back up. Quite a load off my mind and no mistake to get it back. Many thumbs up to the great staff at Buttermilk and Bourbon!!"
46,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/30/2022,"Surprisingly delicious menu. 
Drinks are strong boozy enough and the right amount of sweet.
The roasted Brussel sprouts had amazing dressing to go with it."
47,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,11/26/2021,"Just here for the foooooooood

The place seems like a vibe though, with some outdoor seating available. 

Drinks delicious , mixed well

The food is small plates so if you are coming there too really EAT , then you need to buy a few things off the menu. 

The alligator fries is a must, SOOOOOOOO good! 
Sliders ehh nothing special 
Short rib plate - delicious!
I couldn't remember what fish meal I got it might have been a special- but it was very tasty
Kudos to the chef team for these unique plates!

Will be back for sure!"
48,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,11/6/2021,"This place is sooo good for brunch and dinner. It's New Orleans/Cajun themed with voodoo vibes - so fun! The drinks are really really good and the food is amazing to match.

If you come here and don't get the biscuits you're doing it wrong. They're warm and glazed with honey - I have dreams about them daily.

Also, the gator fries with real alligator are sooo good. The fried chicken is done right here too. Can't wait to go back!"
49,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,1/12/2022,"Perhaps this place was a bit overhyped or maybe I went in with too many expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised!

It is tapas style and the portions are small, so I'd suggest ordering 4 things to be filling!

I went with a friend and ordered 4 things with a bit of leftovers to take home. 

Warm Honey Glazed Biscuits - this is their staple and a must! I could eat these all day if I could! The butter that comes with it is to die for, but you definitely get full after eating 2. 

Shrimp and Grits - interesting flavor profile, wasn't bad at all but I wouldn't get it again over the other options.

Nashville Hot Alligator Fries - standards fries with a little bit of a kick. I think it's worth getting once but not a staple order. 

House special Buttermilk Fried Chicken w / Sweet & Spicy Sauce - classic and must order if you're going to go there. Im not a huge lover of fried stuff but this was not too oily and portions were more than enough for me and my friend."
50,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,2/16/2022,Maybe I didn't order the right thing considering I'm vegetarian. I ordered the peanut hummus and the Brussels sprouts and I didn't feel too good after eating them. The peanut hummus tasted too bland and the Brussels sprouts were overly flavorful. Maybe a bad combo? I could still taste the Brussels sprouts the next day after brushing.
51,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,2/16/2022,"Southern comfort food done right!! Everything I ate here was insanely delicious, but definitely not super healthy. Great comfort tapas to share with a friend or on a date. The catfish and Mac and cheese are so good."
52,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,4/26/2021,"This is a great spot located slightly off of newbury street! The fried chicken (Nashville spicy) was really crispy and actually very tolerable in terms of spice. It was an enjoyable spicy level, not one where i felt like I was dying. 

The Cocktails are delicious, I can barely taste the alcohol. The sweet potatoes and Mac and cheese were amazing as well. I'd recommend 1-2 dishes per each person in your party and sharing is encouraged. 

Good food, good experience. Can't ask for much more."
53,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,9/1/2021,"I was surprised to see this place on Yelp and other sites as a highly recommended restaurant/bar (who would think a southern style place would be good in Boston?). I finally checked it out and loved it! 

It's located on a beautiful street, in a pretty historic building. Plenty of outdoor seating, nice decor indoors, the staff is great. 

I had the boneless fried chicken thighs with Nashville hot (it had a good kick so be careful if you don't like spice) and the crawfish hand pies. The portions were good (enough for two people), and they were both flavorful. 

They also have unique cocktails, but they can make you anything you want. The first drink I had was sweet, but I had the bartender make me a Negroni which was perfect."
54,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,8/22/2021,I would give 3.5-4 stars. It was my first time trying alligator fries and it literally does taste like fried chicken. I enjoyed alligator. The beignets were cooked so fresh and powdered just right. The restaurant is downstairs and it's a cool atmosphere.
55,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/12/2021,"Make a reservation!! This restaurant is always packed, and reservations for the weekend dinner/brunch are always booked!! 

This place was amazing. From the decor, the service, the food...it was all incredible. I'm very analytical, and I literally don't have ONE bad thing to say! They are also opening a 2nd location in Watertown down the street from me and I can't wait!"
56,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,2/8/2022,"Love this place! Very cool vibes inside, good food and drinks. Tapas style, lots of southern themed food."
57,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,8/1/2021,Love love the food here. Fried alligators with fries and pickles were AMAZING! Heavily seasoned with comeback sauce. The burger sliders didn't disappoint either. Perfect summer weather to have some soft serve mimosas. The outdoor sitting view was very pretty and romantic. It was a great brunch experience there.
58,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,4/4/2021,"I've been here several times at lunch, dinner, late at night, holidays. The waitstaff have always been professional and very efficient with scheduling. They have a edgier artistic ambiance than the typical glitzy airy Back Bay, so would be a good spot for dates. Usually very busy.

I like their cocktails most, and really enjoy trying new items on their menu - 3 months after ordering and loving their buttery crab dip, it's been replaced with something new on the menu. I hope it comes back soon! Split their beignets with a friend, they're worth it."
59,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,9/26/2021,"First time here. We finally decided to try Buttermilk & Bourbon's brunch. The overall experience was nice. We ordered jalapeño grits, andouille sausage, eggs, biscuits and beef sliders. Overall the food probably would have tasted great had it all been served hot instead of lukewarm. The grits were just cold cold, so we sent it back. Another concern was everything came out one dish at a time. The sausage came out first...a long wait...then out comes grits...another wait...biscuits were served...wait wait wait...oh here are the eggs. Get the idea? And with the exception of the sliders which were a nice temperature and served last, we weren't able to eat food together like a meal. Nonetheless, it wasn't a bad experience and the food had good flavor. Maybe we'll try again for lunch or dinner."
60,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,7/26/2021,"found myself here with a group on a saturday late afternoon. we went in with no reservation and were told to either come back at 10p for a table or sit at the bar, so we chose the bar

staff was quick and ordering was efficient. i started out with dessert first because i didn't want a large meal. chose the beignets because i had heard they were pretty good here. i think they were hyped up too much because i didn't think they were anything special and tasted reminiscent of the fried dough with powdered sugar you can get at town fairs. after finishing those, i found myself still hungry so went for the new orleans bbq shrimp. this dish was amazing and made up for the lackluster beignets. i've never had grits before and the texture took a while to get used to but the sauce that this dish has is perfect with the grits. i also wish there were more shrimp instead of just 4. i quickly ate all the shrimp and was left with a bunch of grits at the end. still a great dish though! 

good place, nice ambiance, good vibe and friendly staff. would come back"
61,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,7/6/2021,"I had high hopes for Buttermilk & Bourbon, and while I enjoyed my meal I don't think I'd return. We went on a warm Sunday around noon and were able to make a 2pm reservation. The hostess was very helpful. When we came back at 2, we had a table on the sidewalk patio. 

The outdoor space is very nice, it's a pretty quiet street without too much traffic. We ordered the Big Freedia and Frozen Voodoo drink, both were very good and refreshing! Very fun brunch drinks. 

For food, we got the warm honey glazed biscuits and chicken and waffles to share. The fried chicken was amazing, hot and fresh and flavorful. The carbs were a little disappointing though. The biscuits were HUGE, but only the glazed outside parts had much flavor. The cheese and butter spread helped but I felt like the biscuits were lacking some natural flavor. The waffles were a little soft and soggy, they tasted good but didn't have the right crispy texture I want from waffles. I did really like the watermelon on the side. 

The kitchen seemed really backed up and our food came out in a weird order. We got a side of scrambled eggs first, a long wait, then our two drinks, another wait, and then the rest of the food. We also ordered a side of bacon that never came. Our server was very nice and took it off our tab. 

Overall, a nice Sunday brunch with really good drinks! I probably wouldn't come back for just the food though."
62,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,9/6/2021,"One of the only restaurants in Boston I know that serves good southern food. We ordered a multitude of items, including the BBQ Shrimp, Boneless Thighs Nashville hot, Nashville Hot Alligator fries, Slow Roasted Baby Back Ribs, and the bread pudding for dessert. Everything was delicious, and the Nashville hot alligator and chicken had a great kick. Our entrees for 4 totaled about $100, which is a great value considering the quality and variety. Our waitress was also very kind and attentive.

My only complaint is we ordered a lemonade and iced tea. The lemonade was very bitter and the iced tea was watery. I would caution against non alcoholic drinks and request ""light ice"" for any drinks. Otherwise, great experience!"
63,Buttermilk & Bourbon,2 star rating,7/1/2021,"While the food here might be okay the service was snooty and parking was atrocious. I got the burnt waffles, dry fried chicken and old watermelon. They get two stars because the beignets and churro ice cream were awesome. I won't be back in a hurry. If I do, I hope to update this review."
64,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,8/24/2021,"Came here with reservations on a Monday afternoon. We were seated on time by the friendly hostess. It was a comfortable ambience with simply decorated plants located about. 

We ordered family style including the simple roasted mushroom toast, Nashville hot alligator fries, chicken wings in sweet & spicy sauce, crawfish etoufee hand pies, New Orleans BBQ shrimp, and baby kale salad for some additional greens. I liked the variety of mushrooms used for the toast as well it being a hearty slice. We had the alligator served on the side of the fries due to a food preference in which everyone enjoyed by itself. The alligator reminded me of perfectly fried popcorn chicken. We were surprised the wings were coated in the sauce as opposed to served on the side as it did cause the skin to be on the soggy side. The flavors themself were not as complementary as other sweet & spicy sauces I've had. I liked the crawfish pies as the dough held their shape well but would have preferred a spicy Mayo or more creamy sauce as opposed to the regular Mayo and red hot served. When eating the shrimp and grits, I found it to be incredibly salty and heavy. Definitely would pass on in the future. They ran out of ricotta for the kale salad but I'm not sure how much of a difference it would have made as I found it to fall flat of being a well balanced in taste and texture. 

Our dessert was the fresh fried beignets with chocolate. The name is accurate as they were hot from the fryer but lacked the satisfying chewy dough aspect as it was very airy. It would have better matched the heavy chocolate sauce on the side as well.

Overall, decent experience with a friendly waitress. Would want to come again knowing which dishes I enjoyed and to try some of their drinks."
65,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,8/22/2021,Not bad. But also not New Orleans. Not that they said it would be. The hand pies were mostly celery and did were quite reminiscent of etouffe as I'd hoped. The dri KS were great . The NO bbq shrimp was aiight but I thought it was a little heavy on the BBQ. It completely overpowered the grits. The chicken sliders were awesome. I wished I had gotten the chicken dish. Service was good. It's small plates and tapas so keep that in mind.
66,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/15/2022,"Absolutely ammaazzzzimg food and service (Fernando was our sever)! I mean, just phenomenal!"
67,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,7/3/2021,"Great spot in Back Bay, consistently great food, drinks and service. Fried chicken crispy and not greasy. Baked goods sweet. Drinks hurricane, soft serve Prosecco, very next level. Outdoor vibe great o a nice day. Right side back room is a bit dark and stuffy. Service always top notch. Has something for every taste bud. Definitely one of our regular family spots."
68,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,12/22/2020,"I came here for brunch during the random 60 degree December Sunday this year. We had an outside table with a time limit of 90 minutes. Unfortunately, everyone and their mother was in Back Bay that day (pandemic be damned) and it took forever to find parking. By the time I was able to get to the table, we only had a small amount of time left, so my friend placed a share order for us while I circled around in my car.

We had a couple of bloody marys that were quite good and came with a large shrimp to munch on. My next drink was the Whodi Smash (bourbon, lemon, blackberry, mint) which was fairly light, but tasty. A good brunch drink.

For food, we shared the beignets (almost like they came out of New Orleans!) and the fried chicken and waffles. The portions were quite large and perfect for sharing. We got 3 large pieces of chicken and a normal sized cheddar waffle. There were a couple of sauces (sweet and spicy syrup and honey butter) and a side of watermelon. I do wish there was a ""normal"" syrup, but I didn't ask, so maybe that could have been added or substituted. The food was quite good and I wish I had a chance to taste more dishes. I'll try to come back soon!"
69,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,4/4/2022,Very delicious tapas-style dishes! The fried chicken was the best I've ever had. We also loved the New Orleans style shrimp. The cocktails were also sooo delicious. 10/10 would come back
70,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,3/6/2022,"I went and they had no fried foods, so my review is a bit lacking; however, *almost* everything I had was flavorful and delicious. FYI: this is a small plates restaurant 

The octopus, short rib mac and cheese, and glazed biscuits were cooked perfectly and my favorite part of the meal. The octopus was so tinder and I really enjoyed the smokey flavor. Classic biscuit and cinnamon butter combo, hits every time. The pimento butter wasn't my favorite, but it might be yours. 

I wouldn't recommend their oysters, raw or cooked, definitely can find better elsewhere. Service was nice, drinks were pretty good and a little strong, which is a plus for me. Have to update when I can try the fried foods. Give it a try for a fun dinner with friends, great place for sharing food and having nice conversations."
71,Buttermilk & Bourbon,2 star rating,5/28/2021,"If this was suppose to be one of Boston's best restaurants, I can the hear the  crowd of food critics chanting,  ""o-v-e-r-r-a-t-e-d!!"" First of all, I want to give the customer service a half-star because they came to work today. Other than that,  I was unimpressed with the care and attention they gave their customers. I rode a blue bike from South Station to BackBay because I was expecting this restaurant to blow me away with an excellent service and food. The pictures on their website made the food look tantalizing and raised my expectations. But from my first impression with customer service,  to my last impression with tasting the food, I was extremely disappointed. It felt like I was in an episode of ""Restaurant Catfish,"" if that's a real show. 

Here's a summary of my experience:

I was told that there was no more seating because they  ""overbooked"" - even  though there were numerous empty seats without a wave of customers flooding into the restaurant. So, I decide to order take out because I had to try the food that was well advertised. I was especially interested in the ""signature chicken"" and the ""shrimp with grits"". I ordered those items and patiently waited for thirty minutes hoping that the delicious food will cleanse mental palette from the  bad customer service experience. When I received my food, I started with eating the ""shrimp and grit."" As the combination of flavors hit my palette, my high expectation came crashing down from a potential five stars restaurant to a one star. I couldn't believe it - so I tried a second bit hoping my palette was lying on me. Sad to say, this was truthful reality - the food was salty and flavors were well below average. The best part of this dish was the texture of the grits - it was cooked well. The flavor combination was not good. 

Now, I definitely had a negative perception of this restaurant because good restaurants are suppose to serve tasty food, no matter what you order from the menu. Since the food was bad, my assumption was the signature chicken was definitely be  ""over hyped"" by the pictures. I tried to clear my mind of these negative assumptions as I sunk my teeth into the chicken. I remembered the comment the receptionist made as I ordered, ""Sir, you will looove this chicken."" As the flavor hit my palette, I thought to myself, ""I do not like this chicken."" It had a freezer burn taste that's suppose to be cleaned off good fried chicken and the popular ""Nashville Hot"" flavor was wack.  I apologize for this hard criticism, but this is my honest perception - especially when a restaurant is over hyped. May it was this  bravado that contributed to the lack of attention to excellent service and good on this day. The great ones are humble, confident, and consistently excellent. I hope they were just having a bad day, because today, I have to say this place will receive a two stars from me. Cheesecake Factory is better by far. I may come back again after making a reservation ""two weeks"" in advance - by the way I am writing this review on a bench in a park near the restaurant and it still have not rained yet. I could have paid a good tip by eating at their outdoor seating, but instead they lost the tip and a good customer."
72,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,8/19/2021,"Came here for birthday drinks with a few friends. The cocktails were really fun - I started with a B&B Hurricane with came topped with liquid nitrogen and was delicious. I also had the Tipitina (I think) which was topped with a rock candy lollipop.

We were told that 1-2 plates per person were the norm, so as a group of 3, we got 6 items.

We got the wings with Nashville hot seasoning and white BBQ sauce. The Nashville hot was good, the white BBQ was fine but they originally made them plain and gave us the sauce on the fine. Not sure how they taste when made correctly.

We also had the pulled pork croquettes (delicious), the roasted jalapeno mac & cheese (the star of the show), the salmon hushpuppies (a special of the day. They were good, but not spectacular), and finally, the shrimp & grits (so good).

I would give them five stars BUT we ordered oysters and didn't get them for over 20 minutes so canceled them.

They did give us a very tiny cup of mocha ice cream as we were celebrating a birthday.

All in all, I would return and give them another chance. The food was good after all, a 7/10 in my book."
73,Buttermilk & Bourbon,2 star rating,9/19/2021,"The two stars are really only earned for the service. We ate here after hearing so many people speak of it, but honestly I wish we saved our money and went elsewhere. We ordered five items honey glazed biscuits, crawfish etouffee handpies, pulled pork croquettes, chicken sliders, and alligator hot fries. 

Honey Glazed Biscuits: Tragically the best part of the meal but that's not saying much. The biscuits are decent and have a nice blend of sweet and savory served with pimento cheese, cinnamon sugar butter, and flaky salt on top. 

Crawfish Etouffee Handpie: Do yourself a favor and skip this! This dish is just a series of flavors that don't go together. Outside wrapper is a masa dough that fries up crisp but just does not match with the cajun flavors of etouffee. The etouffee is underwhelming on its own and is mostly bell peppers and onions. The few pieces of crawfish you do get are dry and over cooked. The dish is paired with mayo and hot sauce which just adds to the taste bud confusion when eating but doesn't really add much else.

Pulled Pork Croquettes: Another skip. Nice crispy panko breaded exterior and reminds me a bit of arancini but less enjoyable. Taste is like a pork green chile served with bbq sauce than pulled pork itself. The ball is 90% rice 5% peppers and 5% pork. Textures are again nice but flavors were a total miss for us.

Chicken Sliders: If you really have to eat here, then this is not the worst thing, but it's certainly not the most amazing chicken sandwich even when comparing to the cheaper counterparts (popeyes, wendy's, etc). Chicken itself is painfully bland and overcooked. The sandwich itself relies heavily on the bacon jam and pickles to add flavor which personally made it quite bland especially when you get a bit with only chicken.

Gator hot fries: Another ""if you have to order something"" dish. When fresh I could imagine this being tasty, but this dish was lukewarm when brought to the table. Fries had started to go soggy and the gator is, again, overcooked but this time well seasoned. Didn't love the addition of the pimento cheese but overall not the worst.

Overall notes:
- food was not hot when we dined here. It was lukewarm at best for the majority of our dishes
- flavors don't pair well together 
- if you're in search of the punchy cajun flavors this is NOT your place. Save your money and go elsewhere."
74,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,11/10/2021,"We walked into Buttermilk & Bourbon after calling to see if there was room at the bar. They happened to have a table open they offered us if we could eat within an hour 1/2. No problem! Since highland fried closed down near us we have been looking for fried chicken to satisfy the cravings. 

The whole ambiance is super cool and feels like you've been transported out from a basement in boston to New Orleans. The staff and waiters were very attentive. We skipped the biscuits because they were only offered in tins of 4 - but I'm sure that was a mistake after seeing them pass by. 

We tried a few different dishes - they suggested 2-3 per person. We had the fried chicken (a little dry and not very crispy) and the gator fries (pretty tasty! But I wish there was more sauce). The bbq shrimp grits were maybe my favorite. I loved dipping the fries in the leftover grits. The ribs were pretty tasty as well! 

I had very high expectations for this place but overall it was pretty delicious and a great feel. I would bring visitors here for a night of small plates and drinks."
75,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,7/11/2021,"A friend recommended this place to me when I was in town so I went with a group and had the best time!

I always find tapas places are great for groups because they offer a wide variety of dishes for everyone to try. This isn't a traditional tapas place and they definitely don't serve traditional Spanish food but what we did have was delicious. Namely, the black eyed pea hummus, the kale salad, and the sliders. 

The food took a little longer to come out but the servers made sure they were candid about running behind and got us ample drinks while we waited. 

For me, the cocktails were the best part of the night. The drinks were creative and well balanced. I got the passionfruit cocktail and my boyfriend got a negroni. Everyone at the table ordered a second of their drink, they were all incredible. The bar program here is clearly well-run.

All in all, it's a great spot!"
76,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,7/10/2021,"A Garden level patio, this place is the perfect spot for a brunch with friends! 

Service was great, the tapas were large. I would actually consider some of these full size meals - we ordered way too many and would've been good with 1.5 each but everything we ordered was delicious. My personal favorites were the honey buns, and the hand pies but you couldn't go wrong with anything!"
77,Buttermilk & Bourbon,1 star rating,4/10/2022,"Went in with my girlfriend and we sat in the lounge room. First thing server spilled water on my girlfriend but things happen, the problem is he barely cleaned up the water at all I had to clean it up. The part that really got me is I got tequila on the rocks and a cocktail. Took Almsot 15-20 minutes to get it while the server served a new table a bottle a wine and an other table drinks before us. When I got my drink my ice in my tequila was melted and made the actual alcohol deluded. Shows that The server had a lack of awareness of when the bartender finished the drinks.  Also the food runner slammed our biscuits on the table and left. When I got my food it was fine. Food was actually very taste just we also had fly flying around our food. To top it all off when I went to tip the server in cash, I was counting the money in my wallet, he just stood there starting at me instead of taking care of his other tables VERY uncomfortable and awkward. The food was good just service it's self was very very terrible. Our server was a young man with an accent and tattoo band around his arm. I'm a bartender and have been in the industry for years. And I never had such a terrible service experience ever. I usually sit at the bar. But this sever just needs better training"
78,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,3/27/2022,"tasty! a creative yet slightly overpriced take on southern food. decor/atmosphere is nice, and the location (right next to newbury st) is unbeatable. had mediocre service when seated on the patio during a busy day. biscuits are memorable and would recommend the hummus. I would come back, but I probably won't make this a regular go-to."
79,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,1/2/2022,"Definitely considered fine dining to me.  It can be expensive but worth it and I guess it depends on how much you're ordering if you're like me and you eat with your eyes first the menu was going to get you going always tasty selections with details in the descriptions that make them seem irresistible. Food is stunning, both the appetizers and inside the restaurant. The ambiance is very welcoming and charming. The desserts are always a hit they change up but the beignets are always there and you won't frown while you're eating those."

The decor is eclectic and the overall environment is relaxed and easy with excellent service.  The menu is diverse but not too complex. It's a lot of fun as group to order a bunch of shareables. The bourbon list was quality and the cocktail menu has something for everyone. Fantastic venue for team dinners!

82,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,7/20/2021,"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing everything! I was first hesitant to try their alligator fries considering it was real alligator meat but it's so yummy that I didn't care afterward. Their baby back ribs literally fell off the bone so easily (no knives or munching needed). It also had this corn mash thing on the bottom that was the perfect amount of sweet and tangy, just amazing. Their fried chicken was alright, not the best but not bad. Their beignets though, redeemed the meal again since it was absolutely to die for!!  

10/10 MUST TRY!"
83,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,4/26/2021,"Came here on a Friday night for a birthday! Street parking only!

The inside was much bigger than I imagined :) The food here is tapas style, I love that you can try so many things without feeling like you need to stick to just your own plate. Make sure you ask for extra utensils for serving if you need :)

We brought our own cake, they charge a $3 per slice cake cutting fee! 

Then we went on to order drinks and food. The Alligator Fries, don't question it. Just get it! The fried alligator literally tastes and feels like fried chicken. The fries though, super crispy, hot and that sauce on top, PERFECT! Get 2 if you're in a group ;)

I really liked the texture of the mac and cheese, where the cheese was super melty and not thickkkkk. The beignets were super freshhh I only wish they were as big as the ones from Cafe Du Monde :)

Overall, I enjoyed my time here :) A bit pricey but considering location and style, its about right."
84,Buttermilk & Bourbon,2 star rating,10/10/2021,"The BAD, the GOOD, and the UGLY.
I like to take a day or two before I review an experience in an effort to stay as fact based and as objective as I possibly can (recognizing that reviews are inherently subjective); my experience was poor as the quality of the service and the food were poor. 

I'm in Boston, hanging out with my son. His birthday was yesterday and we decided to celebrate here. Here are the highlights:

1) Parking was challenging but persistence paid off. We found a spot on the street 2 1/2 blocks away.

2) I made reservations in the Open Table app stressing that it was a Celebratory  event, and requested a nice table .

3) My son and I was shown a middle table against the wall, where we would abut to the table on either side. I requested one of the end tables as it would be more comfortable. The waitress quickly reset us. Thanks!

4. The hostess walked through at least twice and looked at me both times as if annoyed.

5. We had catfish ( B-) alligator ( B+) mac and cheese (C), and beef cheek (C).

6. My son enjoyed the alligator, me not much. The catfish is as hot, but not seasoned well.

7. No one acknowledged Justin's birthday.

8. I asked for coffee, but waited so long for 
cream. The coffee was too cold too drink.

9. The waitress made an attempt to ensure our Dining experience was pleasant, she reseated us promptly and made heart felt recommendations. The timing of the food was off but because there was a food runner perhaps that was not on her.

10. The hostess and/or Waitress acknowledging that it was a special occasion (I wrote a whole paragraph on Open Table about the importance of that night) would have gone a long long way. And if you can't seat someone where they requested, you acknowledge that and say: I see you requested so and so, but unfortunately....

11. All and all, it was not a pleasant night.

12. My feelings only: surely not what the Restaurant was trying to tell me: but I felt unimportant and taken for granted."
85,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,9/4/2020,"Lovely outdoor and indoor dining restaurant in Back Bay that has such unique cocktails and small plates! We had reservations at 8 and were seated shortly after. They were just turning over many tables at once so the service was slow to start. Once they got acclimated and had things under control, dinner service was smooth sailing. 

For the table we had fried chicken sliders, Mac and cheese, biscuits, beef sliders, hummus, salad, Nashville Hot chicken wings, shrimp and grits, fried calamari, and beignets. I recommend everything we had. It was just the right amount of food for 4 people. Love those Beignets!"
86,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,11/13/2021,This place was really good however I was expecting a brunch menu. I did not realize it was only Sunday. We got the chicken sliders biscuits and brie.

88,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,10/4/2021,"Buttermilk & Bourbon has been on my list for a while and it didn't disappoint!

It is so beautiful inside and the food is delicious!

We got the gator fries. It didn't occur to us it was real alligator until after eating it but that is totally fine with me and I'm impressed by the commitment to the Southern theme. The biscuits were amazing. I'd go back just for that. They were warm and flakey as you'd expect.

Buttermilk & Bourbon seems to always be busy which is a great sign for them, but definitely makes it a little difficult if you're looking to show up spontaneously or have a lot of attention from the servers. With that in mind, I thought our brunch was great. Food & drinks were prompt and delicious. What more can you ask for?"

Appetizers:
Oysters & lemon shandy poached shrimp- oysters did not taste good i actually tossed them back out. I was excited for the shrimp as I thought theyd have great unique flavor. Nope! Your typical shrimp cocktail.
Main course: crawfish risotto. Now I love Risotto and adding crawfish sound like a perfect match. Unfortunately this dish was beyond bland. It taste like I was eating bland box risotto and they threw a few pieces of crawfish & tomatoes in there. The risotto was hard and chewy I was highly disappointed 
Lastly for desserts. Had the king cake inspired beignets. & gave the breadpudding a try.
The beignets were delicious and i enjoyed the nice twist of having filling inside. 
The bread pudding however was very disappointing. This was unfortunate as bread pudding is my favorite dessert. The bread puddibg tasted like burnt coffee on bland bread heard to explain but it was gross. The first time I had bread pudding only took 2 bites"

1,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,4/6/2022,"Just giving an updated review. The food is still really good here. The service is exceptional. He really can't go wrong with a place like Saltie girl. I fortunately went on a rainy day so they were able to accommodate us on a walk in because eod some cancellations and missed reservations from the inclement weather. Typically they're booked out with reservations on a regular basis. 

The cod was recommended by the waitress, it was flaky, buttery, and overall delicious. The truffle fries were probably some of the best fries that I've had. I just wish that they had some more condiments like ranch on hand but no biggie. The torched salmon with avocado was a great flavor a combo, albeit small. 

Overall it was another wonderful experience at Saltie Girl."
2,Saltie Girl,1 star rating,4/8/2022,"If you are looking to feel marginalized, you might get that experience here.

April 2021, I went here and after being told to wait five minutes for a patio table I requested, I watched the hostess give it to another party that came after me. I thought maybe that party had a reservation and I was waiting for a different table to be set up, so I waited 10 minutes before asking the hostess how much longer it would be. Turns out the hostess wasn't planning on seating me at all and by her own admission said she completely forgot about me; she forgot I was waiting for a table even though I was standing by a tree maybe 10 feet away from her the whole time. This would have been my first visit to this restaurant and I was excited to try it after hearing good things about the food; unfortunately, because of this experience I decided I will never dine here."
3,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,4/4/2022,"One of my favorite restaurants in Boston. I'm only giving it 4 stars because the quality isn't consistent, especially considering the price. I find weekdays a bit riskier in ensuring you're eating the best & freshest quality they have to offer as well as differing portion amounts.

One of the star dishes in my opinion is the Raw Day Boat Scallops, but when I've ordered it during the week, they've tasted milky and off. Some of the raw oysters can also smell fishy. 

Otherwise, the food here is truly top tier on a good day. I love the Whole Fried Black Bass, Charred Octopus, Raw Tuna and Clam Chowder. Tip: add hot sauce into the clam chowder to elevate it! I was surprised at the Asian take on the bass with a very traditionally executed (and delicious!) sauce. Don't skip on dessert or cocktails either, they're just as good as the main food. The chocolate cake and brown butter cake are both moist and delectable. 

I always recommend this restaurant as a must-visit for the city. Be sure to make a reservation early, they fill up fast!"
4,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/31/2022,"We heard this was a must in Boston from several friends and I'm so glad we went. My parents and I seriously had ourselves a seafood feast. You could probably get the same quality at a lower price point somewhere else and I still need to try Neptune but Saltie Girl does offer reservations and we came away extremely satisfied. 

1. Clam chowder: Possibly the best chowder I've had anywhere. I grew up eating the Campbell version as an after-school snack so clam chowder holds a dear spot in my heart. This is hearty, soothing, with a chunk or two of fried clam. I saw this on every table. 

2. Boston lettuce salad: This is the salad that all restaurant salads should aspire to (looking at you, Via Carota). I am indeed that person who will wax poetic about a salad but this was heavenly - an abundance of fresh, different lettuce leaves, with thinly sliced rounds of carrots, cucumber, chicory, and other root veggies. Beautiful knife work. Light dressing. Not a single brown sliver to be seen. Did someone examine each leaf before it went on the plate? 

3. Snow crab toast: A combination of a few of my favorite things on earth. The bread was crusty, thick, well-buttered, and held up well even after we let it sit for a bit (too many delicious things on the table). Generous helping of crab, along with pistachios and stracciatella. I am drooling even as I write this. Get one or two of these for the table if a bigger group. 

4. Torched salmon belly: Grilled avocado + the tenderest salmon belly. Yes, it's $19 for a few mouthfuls of food. Yes, absolutely worth it. 

5. Whitefish salad: Of all the things we ordered, I think I could have done without this dish, if only because I've been spoiled by NY bagels and lox/whitefish. The whitefish was very salty but nicely balanced out by all the accoutrements. Try to eat this first, as the toasted bagel got stale fast. 

Service: Warm and attentive. I echo all the reviews that say they really do treat you like family here. 

The only downside to this place is the lack of parking but that's a blip on an otherwise exceptional dining experience. Can't wait to come back."
5,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,4/11/2022,Hour long wait just to get a few oysters on a Sunday night. We walked along newbury street until our table was finally ready. It ended up being $60 for a dozen oysters. I get that this is market pricing but it's getting a little out of hand.
6,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/23/2022,"For those who have not been here since 2019 (me, preCOVID). They've moved and now have lots of room and reservations!  The old location is more of a fish and chips and bar. 

Lobster roll was nice, not too buttery and the crispy roll nicely held it together. 
Really enjoyed the clam chowder. Has a hearty depth of flavor and small fried clams as a topping is a brilliant touch. 
Of course the torched salmon belly is just as good as before but has evolved in its presentation. 
Linguini and clams was ok.  More butter than I usually prefer. 
Oysters are cleanly prepared--glacier bay is mild and slightly sweet."
7,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/9/2022,"THIS PLACE LIVES UP TO THE REVIEWS. EVERYTHING WAS SO SO GOOD. 

Searched must-eats in the city and saltie girl was named so many times so I made a reservation a few weeks ahead of time. the staff was really friendly and answered all of our questions. I ordered the clam chowder to split with a friend and a lobster roll. the rest of my party also ordered oysters to go with their meal and they loved the oysters, especially the devon port. my clam chowder was flavorful and so creamy. I ordered the lobster roll and it was buttery and just melted in my mouth. there was ample lobster pieces in it and the bread was to die for. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know. 

please bring back the crab carbonara!! I heard and saw so many good reviews for it and can't wait to try it."
8,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/5/2022,"Don't come here if you're afraid to spend $$$. If not, totally check this place out and order EVERYTHING. You won't be disappointed. The service was great but the food!? Oh man. 
The oysters were the most delicious and fresh I've had in a while, loved the garlic vinegary mixture in the dropper bottle. 
My friend ordered the fried clams and the flavor was out of this world good.  
The torched salmon belly over the most gloriously torched avocado I've ever known? To die for.
Lately, the hot buttered lobster roll was so succulent and perfectly presented. Wish it came with fries but the chips were actually worth trying! We ordered the fries anyway and I tasted a hint of truffle- delicious like everything else."
9,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/5/2022,"One of our go to seafood / hang out restaurant in the area. 
Variety of seafood choices, all of good quality. It's fortunate they are still such a great restaurant after their expansion during the pandemic.
Uni toast, scallop, fried clam, spicy crab roll are our must orders. Also love the torched salmon belly, clam chowder, steak tartare, and tuna flatbread.
Also like their various cocktails, e.g. grapefruit and pineapple."
10,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/21/2022,"Saltie Girl (4.5/5)
I was in the mood for a lobster roll this weekend, so I went to Saltie Girl and sat at the bar and I was not disappointed.  This place is always packed on the weekends, so I decided to have a late lunch around 2pm, and I still had to wait about ten minutes for a seat at the bar.  The wait was worth it though!

I ordered a glass of Momo sauvignon blanc to drink which was pretty good.  I then ordered the clam chowder and a hot buttered lobster roll.  The clam chowder was very good, it came with nice bits of clam meat, potatoes, and bacon.  It was incredibly tasty, and a perfect fit for a snowy day in Boston.  Then the hot buttered lobster roll came out,  which was delicious! The lobster was dressed with lots and lots of butter in a perfectly toasted bun.  It was served with a side of Saltie girl's own potato chips.  For the price (MKT of $38) I do wish it was served with french fries, but the chips were very good regardless.

This is a spot I would definitely recommend you stop by.  I would recommend either getting a reservation or coming at an off hour to try to secure a table here.  It's a very popular place, and for good reason. I can't wait to go back for dinner one of these days!"
11,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/12/2022,"The seafood and drinks were solid. Came here on a Saturday evening and it did not disappoint. 

Petite Seafood Tower: it came with 6 oysters; 3 from the west coast and 3 from the east coast, as well as 2 littleneck clams, 2 top neck clams, 2 jumbo shrimps and a crab salad. The crab salad was really good and the west coast oyster was more flavorful than the east coast because it was sweeter and meatier. I enjoyed the texture and the flavor of the clams, especially the top neck.

Moules Frites: it was very good. It came with mussels cooked in white wine, garlic, butter, lemon, herbs, and topped with Parmesan fries. The sauce was very flavorful and it served well as a dip for the fries.

Overall I enjoyed the meal here and will definitely be back again to try more dishes."
12,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/20/2022,"Hands down the best lobster roll I have had in Boston. While pricey and a bit out of the way from Downtown, I highly recommend making at least one trek into the area to pick up an amazon lobster roll here. 

The food item looks deceptively extremely small. The bread itself is tiny and can easily fit into a child's one hand. However this thing is packed to the brim with lobster. Tasty, juicy, fresh lobster flesh. The roll was seasoned exceptionally well and definitely the best roll in Boston."
13,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,3/27/2022,"Saltie Girl came highly recommended to me on my recent trip to Boston. Definitely make a reservation on Resy, this place is hopping. I started with their cranberry cocktail, which was one of the prettiest drinks I've gotten at a restaurant. Their clam chowder was delicious, complemented with a fried clam on top. I was about three spoonfuls into my chowder though when my main course arrived...a warm lobster roll. I understand that all of the food is cooked to order, but I wish my main course wasn't getting cold while I finished my appetizer. While the dining room was gorgeous, the lighting gets incredibly dim after sunset."
14,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/21/2022,"I've been wanting to go to this place and I finally made it here for brunch with some friends. Making a reservation at least a few days ahead of time is a must! I had a great experience here - the food and cocktails were delicious and the service was exceptional. It's definitely on the pricey side, but you are getting quality food. Here's my review on the food and drinks:

Cocktails ($16/each)
I personally preferred the Grapefruit as it is sweet and fruity. The Pear would be perfect for those who likes a spicy tequila cocktail.

Oysters (~$4/each)
Plump, fresh and cleanly shucked oysters. A few of them were in pretty big shells as well. They were delicious!

Torched Salmon Belly ($19)
Absolutely loved this dish! Each piece of miso glazed salmon belly was so fatty and tender that they melted in our mouths. The char added a deep smoky flavor that was balanced out by the freshness of the avocado slices and diced apples.

Gloucester Lobster Roll ($38)
Excellent lobster roll. I got it served warm. The roll was warm and buttery, stuffed with a generous amount of fresh lobster. Our server told us it was delivered soon after we got there so you can't get any fresher than that! The lobster roll was served with a bag of chips which was good, but nothing special.

Overall, everything I got was tasty and prepared well. I've definitely had equally delicious oysters and lobster rolls for much cheaper. However, I think this place is still worth it for a special occasion if you're willing to splurge."
15,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,1/5/2022,"In my several visits to Boston, I've walked by Saltie Girl multiple times, and I'm so glad I finally stopped in. It was a busy Friday, but we were able to score a table in the bar area. Everything on the menu was mouth watering, but we narrowed it down to some of the best items!

We started with fresh oysters. I honestly can't remember the names of the ones we chose because there were several at the time, but the server was great about describing the taste of all of them and we narrowed it down based on that. My favorite thing was definitely the torched salmon belly. The salmon melted in your mouth and the avocado added the perfect flavor! My next favorite was the steak tartare. Oh my goodness, how it melted with every bite! The toast and Parmesan cheese were perfect addition. You can't go to New England without trying clam chowder, and I was impressed with this one. It had real clams in it and was so creamy. Lastly, we had the calamari. It was so fresh and definitely a great addition to the other choices. I hope to be able to visit again in the future!"
16,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,1/11/2022,"Delicious..

I came here when I was visiting Boston for work due to a recommendation from a friend. And it did not disappoint. 
The 1.25lb lobster bake with the corn and potatoes... Geez.
Cooked to perfection. Melt in your mouth. Everything you'd expect from a lobster done well.
Scallop crudo was also very good.

Oysters were solid but definitely very pricey. For that, hard to justify paying nearly 4 dollars per Oyster. Not sure what I was thinking but I went for it anyway thinking I'd be somehow blow away. It just tastes like really good oysters each with its own slight flavor. 

The table next to mine was definitely jealous when I was digging into the lobster by myself lol. It was just so good and I was just eating it well :)"
17,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,1/16/2022,"I honestly thought this was going to be overrated, but I was pleasantly surprised.

I got the tuna special, but had foie gras on top. Cooked rare. The tuna itself was so soft. My teeth had such a great time sinking into the meat.

The lobster roll wasn't bad. Not my favorite but not bad at all. 
They have their own potato chips! It was awesome!

The octopus was a bit rubbery.
But the real winner was the seafood tower. It is an absolute must!!

Crab was amazing, tuna was amazing, oysters and clams were great.

A bit pricey, but good experience."
18,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,1/22/2022,"Been reading about this restaurant for a few yrs finally made it - today's destination - with my girlfriend , son &  fiance 
Very nice restaurant, relaxed yet buttoned down  professional. Excellent service as well.

You start with today's selection of raw bar and there are a LOT of great choices offered with personal pad and pencil for type and  quantity.

We started with 12 osters, and the presentation is a 5.0 with a  lot of fine tuned  condiments. I added a few crab legs, ( very small but tasty, if you like them get at least 6) total average score  4.0.
Dishes ordered
Started with clam chowder 5.0 it's excellent , big bowl
Lox and bagel with lots of side stuff... 4.0
Fried Lobster - different really good 4.4
Lobster roll ( hot) 4.5
Galic steamed mussels 4.3
We all drank  champagne ( no. Prosecco but great alternative)
The desert menu is wanting, none of the only 3 of interest to us 
Overall, this is a great seafood restaurant and I highly recommend it."
19,Saltie Girl,1 star rating,12/15/2021,"TL;DR - The Torched Salmon Belly had some good flavors and was nicely balanced but was burnt. The Lobster Roll was filled with chewy claw meat. This made the sandwich not very enjoyable. The menu was uninspired, and the prices were outrageous. Meanwhile, the service left a bit to be desired. 

The brobdingnagian lambasting:

Are you kidding me?! I take my parents out to eat for a Christmas gift to this?! The sheer mediocrity is compounded by one gut punch after another that will make a return visit to Saltie Girl unlikely even if they paid me. 

One of the problems with one of Yelp's updates: it's harder to see average ratings over time. Thinking about the 4.5-star average rating, the phrase ""Lies, blank lies, and statistics"" comes to mind. 

Anyways, I am a believer that the theater starts with the cloakroom. In the case of this restaurant, you could argue this is hand-washing. The water was so cold it felt as if it were filtered through ice twice over. Not helping matters, the soap is the kind that takes a little effort to wash off. This ordinarily would be a good thing, especially in the age of COVID... but not when you can't feel them. How do you all expect me to hold a fork, eh?

For food, we decided to go for something simple. The three of us ordered the same thing: Torched Salmon Belly and a warm Lobster Roll. More on this later. 

The Torched Salmon Belly wasn't half bad! The avocado was ripe, the sauce was pleasant, and the veggies rounded everything out. The piece of salmon belly, though, was tiny! The flavors and textures were mainly good, only it may have been torched a little too much, for the crust was burnt! $19 for half an avocado and a piece of salmon belly the size of two dominoes, at best. 

Then came the $38 abomination called the Lobster Roll. Where to even start with this thing? The lobster was claw meat, a little firm but worse: chewy! With this being a sandwich, biting a piece off without dragging a whole lot more filling with it isn't possible. The meat was lightly buttered, and the inside of the bread seemed to have a little mayo, but that's it. No veggies or any other fresh elements.

I can forgive that there isn't a choice of bread (not everyone likes sweet bread), but a lack of options with the chips is much less forgivable. Salt and vinegar chips don't agree with everyone's palate. Don't like them? Sorry! 

Speaking of choice and variety... ordinarily, we love to get different things and try everything. I also love to try new and unique cocktails. With all of us getting the same thing and me passing on the cocktails speaks to their uninspired menu (though I realize this is more us than anything else).

Then there was the service. For a location of this caliber (looking at prices), I would expect the service to be top-notch, or at least above-average. For how quiet the restaurant was, the service was slow and unattentive. Then, towards the end, when they brought the payment machine, the server was looking over my shoulder as I completed the transaction (and selected the tip). The pressure, man! 

(Visit date = 12/15/2021)"
20,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,12/6/2021,"If you're looking for a great fresh seafood spot, Saltie Girl is the place to go! They have an upstairs and downstairs area. The upstairs is way trendier than downstairs. I must say, they have the best clam chowder and warm or cold lobster rolls! The only thing I would say about the lobster roll is that I wouldn't pay almost 40 dollars for it.... Anyways, I love their fun cocktail cups too from sea horses to blowfish etc. I'd definitely recommend this spot, highly recommend and very satisfied. 

Things I ordered: 
- Clam Chowder: marble potato / salsify / bacon
- Torched Salmon Belly*: avocado / apple / cucumber / miso glaze
- Hot French Bread sea salt butter
- Gloucester Lobster Roll: warm or cold Saltie Girl Sea Salt & Vinegar Potato Chips
- Charred Octopus
spicy nduja / fingerling potatoes / fennel / cress"

The services and food was amazing . We had the dwac urchin Uni which comes out with the dropper bottle , the day boat crudo, the torched salmon belly with avocados , yellowtail crudo and the delicious branzino . Everything came out Instagram looking and as good as it looks . Words can't describe how fresh and the excellence of it all."
22,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/6/2022,"LOVE. LOVE. LOVE! In Boston for the weekend with family and had a truly magnificent experience here. Drinks were on point and presented beautifully. The Saltie martini--vodka, gordal olive, pickled onion, caviar--was fabulous both visually and in its deliciousness (highly recommend). Highlights from the meal were snow crab avocado toast, oysters (I could slurp back raw oysters), the fresh-baked bagel with pastrami lox, and snow crab legs. Simply divine, every bite. If you're a seafood lover, you can't miss here."
23,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,12/13/2021,"We wanted to get lobster rolls while we were in Boston and our friend who was in town about a month before us had recommended the lobster rolls at Saltie Girl. The restaurant seems to be popular during dinner hours since we were only able to find an opening at 5:30pm even though they are open until about 10 or 11pm, but it was completely empty when we went during lunch hours on a Monday. 

The lobster roll here did not disappoint and I would say this was the best lobster roll I've ever had.  You can get it chilled or hot. I got mine hot and I would highly recommend it. The lobster roll came on a soft, buttery toasted bun and there were huge chunks of lobster that were cooked to perfection. The lobster roll is always market price and it turned out to be pretty pricey since it was $38 that day (not including tip and tax), but it was totally worth it and I would come back here to order the lobster roll again the next time we're back in Boston. The server was also really friendly and did not pressure us to order drinks or appetizers."
24,Saltie Girl,2 star rating,2/21/2022,This restaurant truly disappointed me and left me expecting more. The restaurant is very cute and has a cute aesthetic--think pink walls and black velvet walls. The menu is mostly focused on seafood. We started with an order of oysters and were very disappointed with the quality. Then we moved on to small plates to share. We ordered the crab roll and the calamari frito and we found both to be underwhelming. The main plate was the tuna flatbread. It came covered in so much arugula and so much tomato sauce as the base. It felt so sloppy and had way too many flavor profiles. Honestly we came here with high hopes and left feeling a bit cheated. The meal here was okay and the price was high.
25,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,12/1/2021,"What I wouldn't give to snap my fingers and be back here at brunch! Everything we ordered outdid the last thing we had just eaten ( and boy did we order a lot), from the roasted acorn squash, to the oysters and the pastrami smoked lox and bagel, and beyond. 

Fantastic staff, Laid back environment for indoor or outdoor dining. 

Cocktails looked wonderfully, the variety of oysters was IMPRESSIVE, and the freshness of everything really makes this place stand out. Counting down the days until my next visit.
I"
26,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,3/31/2022,"I ordered the clam chowder, warm lobster roll, and oysters. The clam chowder was underwhelming but not bad. A little lighter than I like it. The lobster roll was delicious and the bun was soft with just the right amount of butter. Oysters were fresh and juicy. One thing to note is the price. You're paying a premium for the quality of seafood that you're getting. It's a little hard to justify paying ~$40 for a lobster roll, but if you do decide to come, I highly recommend it. In summary, good quality of seafood at a premium price."
27,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/9/2022,"Really lives up to the hype! Honestly didn't try this place out for a while because it looked basic & hyped up, but it really impressed me. We came for brunch and really splurged, but really enjoyed ourselves! 
First off drinks -- we ordered a pear cocktail and blood orange cocktail. The pear cocktail was good but not much pear flavor and tasted like a margarita. The blood orange cocktail was amazing, really not like anything else I've tried! It was sweet but not too sweet and we couldn't get enough of it. 
Next up food -- highly recommend the salmon belly, clam chowder, and fried calamari. Salmon belly was amazing, great flavor and balanced out with avocado. Clam chowder was SO good, probably some of the best I've tried. Fried calamari was also awesome, loved that it was unique and had a kick in it by frying jalapeño peppers into the batter. 
Raw oysters and fries were also great! The least impressive (and most expensive) was unfortunately the lobster benedict. Quite underwhelming and definitely have had better. 
Ambience is also great! It wasn't too crowded for Saturday brunch, decor is very hip. Our waitress was also super nice and attentive, would always fill up our water when emptied and offered to change our plates twice when dirty. 
Overall a great experience! It is pricey, but a great splurge once in a while."
28,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,11/24/2021,"Updating my review because last night was the first time we came back since COVID!

The updates to the menu were amazing. We stuck with our oyster selections and torched salmon belly which were of course delicious. The salmon and avocado pairing is so on point. The hot sauce with the oysters is house made and pairs so well.

New items that are a must:

The moules frites were amazing! Perfectly crispy Parmesan fries and the butter sauce used to cook the mussels was insanely delicious, and also made for a nice dip for the fries. 

We finished with the lobster roll and newly the fried cauliflower both of which were delectable.

Will definitely keep coming back, check out my pictures for some photos of the new items .

The ambiance was updated to reflect the Saltie Girl vibes, as well. Felt cozy and modern at the same time."
29,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/10/2022,"Magical! That's honestly the only way I could properly describe this establishment. Sure, it's my first time here so maybe I'm a bit starstruck but everything was simply off the chart good. Reservations are probably needed but I was able to get a spot at the bar. The bartender was wonderful which is always a plus when you're on your own. 

I decided to get a dirty Martini as I examined the items on the menu. I opted for the cod which was served on a bed of brussels sprouts, corn, spinach purée, and beech mushrooms. It was like a book I didn't want to end. 

I saw other dishes coming out that also made me crave. The steak tartare is absolutely on my list for the next visit. Saltie Girl chips are a great treat to take home as well! Do it!"
30,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/27/2022,"Is 6 stars an option? Wow what an outstanding experience! I was in Boston for for a very short business trip but knew I had to find some great seafood, and Saltie Girl did not disappoint! Amazing menu, great service and the food is sublime. 

I met a colleague there for dinner; since we didn't have a reservation we opted for the bar. It was lively and fun and the bartenders were engaging and attentive. We had a great time and a memorable meal. I can't wait to visit again."
31,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,11/6/2021,"Every day I think about the fried lobster and waffles that they have on their brunch menu. I had never had fried lobster before but wow was it good paired with the waffles and syrup. Their raw bar is great with a wide selection of oysters etc. The over the top avocado toasts with seafood look great but we didn't get that.

I can't wait to come back and eat the lobster and waffles."
32,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,1/24/2022,"Absolutely love this place! I love that the restaurant offers reservations now. I  remember when I went a few years ago they did not take reservations and you had to sign in and wait for hours to get a table. We ordered two of each of the oysters they had available at the raw bar. We weren't fans of the oysters from Washington or Canada, but we highly recommend the oysters from Mass. and Maine. We also ordered the torched salmon belly, clam chowder, and fried lobster and waffles. The torched salmon belly was amazing, however, the ratio of avocado to salmon was very unequal unless you love avocado. The clam chowder is one of the best I've had. It is on the lighter side in terms of thickness, but full of flavor and clams. The fried lobster and waffles is a must order. The waffles are perfectly light and crispy and fried lobster is better than you expect!"
33,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,11/21/2021,"My sister and I ate here on a Saturday night after having made reservations at least 2 weeks in advanced as seats fill fast. Ambience was casual but also urbane, allowing you to dress up or down to your choosing. 

For appetizers, we shared the petite tower and scallop boat. We enjoyed the fresh oysters and jumbo shrimp served in the tower along with the sides of crab salad, cocktail sauce, lemon wedges, and tincture for the vinegar. However, we didn't like the clams due to the texture and taste which was no fault of the restaurants. The scallop sashimi was fresh but had a pungent citrus flavor that was honestly too much. I do prefer a squeeze of lemon over my seafood but it tasted like the scallops had been soaked. It was difficult to enjoy. 

Our entrees were the cioppino and hot lobster roll. Upon receiving our order, we found out the cioppino came with black squid ink pasta which was a fun surprise. The overall sauce was seasoned but not anything to rave about with minimal amounts of seafood. We shared the lobster roll which was filled with fresh pieces of claws, tails and more. It was served well but also not anything too unique. 

We wrapped up our meal with the French apple cake with a side of vanilla ice cream. The warm cake contrasted with the cold ice cream making for a satisfying way to end the meal. We found it to be a comfortable level of sweetness. 

Overall, the meal was decent but I was anticipating more given the difficulty of obtaining a seat and price point. Our acumen waitress was amiable and made us feel welcomed. Perhaps we didn't order their signature dishes so another visit is required for a more thorough evaluation."
34,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,11/21/2021,"The dining spots on Newbury are always hit or miss for me, but Saltie Girl did not disappoint! Was it the best seafood I've ever had in the area? No, but the location, the decor, and the food were all super solid, especially for brunch.

Oysters - they have a good variety of options, and the servers are really knowledgable about each one in case you're having a hard time deciding. The hot sauce and vinegar come in little droppers, which is cute but a little impractical. Still super fresh and tasty

Tuna - the sauce that it came it was a little too overwhelming and took away from the flavor and texture of the fish. Probably not the highest quality raw fish but a good option nonetheless

Eggs & eggs - soft, creamy, yummy, honestly some of the most decadent eggs I've ever had. But the TOAST!! So fluffy and lathered in butter, we were both so full but could not stop eating it.

Fried cauliflower - lowkey my favorite thing there! So crispy, tasty, really a great balance of flavors. The perfect amount of cheese, a touch of sweetness from the apple, ugh. Yum.

Of all the spots on Newbury, this is one worth stopping in for! It's popular for a reason, be sure to plan ahead and book online or put your name in in advance. Definitely recommend!"
35,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,4/8/2022,"Could be great, but the management and service pulls it down to a 3 star. 

Cons - Be prepared for a very rushed meal! We ordered five dishes and they brought them all at once. Overwhelming. And everything got cold. I've never seen a nicer restaurant not make any effort to course things out. The waitress and manager said that's how they operate . . . they put everything in together and serve it as it comes out of the kitchen. Sounds to me like the management is focused on turning tables as fast as possible above all else. 

Pros - The food was good to excellent. Def recommend the torched salmon with avocado, which was unique and excellent. Also like the vibe, which is loungey and fun."
36,Saltie Girl,1 star rating,3/28/2022,"The food was terrible. Worst seafood place ever!!! The oysters were dirty with sands and mud. We found a hair underneath the shrimp, and the waitress apologized and offered us a new order of shrimp. It costs $250 for the royal seafood tower and it gave us a really bad experience. The salmon belly was burnt and it's tasted really bad. Lastly, it's the short rib. Omg, it probably out of salt. No flavor at all. We just had two bites and will never touch it again. The waitress wants to cancel this item for us, but it's too late at that time. We already done the payment. 
Be honest, I will definitely choose another restaurant for this price point. The service was great, but I have to pack my order by myself and asked for a too go bag was disappointed. Overall, I will never come back again. The food looks good, but it tasted really really bad! I don't know why it have so many good reviews. Not worth it!!!!!"
37,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,1/30/2022,"Of all the stops in the city for lobster roll, this was one of the best. They do have the hot and cold option for the lobster roll, but I usually opt for the hot one and boy I was not disappointed. Very warm and buttery and served with their signature potato chips, you can't go wrong! Some raw oysters were also ordered which was very good. The uni (sea urchin) was one of the best I have had. Would definitely recommend. The clam chowder was delicious! And lastly, the torched salmon belly was pretty good. As per other reviews regarding the salmon belly, it is avocado heavy so keep that in mind. The only bad thing I guess would be that the portions did seem a bit small, but otherwise everything was perfect!"
38,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,1/19/2022,"- No AC in the bar area, expect to sweat.
- Do not walk in, damn near impossible to sit down in or outside without an hour wait and the bar is hit or miss but more miss than hit!
- Service don't expect nice people to greet you they're stressed and it shows unfortunately
- East and west coast oyster platter was not to my taste buds won't do it again
- Clam chowder is rich but very good and saved the day
- Lobster roll is over rated imho go to a oceanside hole in the wall shack and get a real one
- parking is a no go unless you want to hunt for a while and may have to walk far

Prob won't come back. The review hyped this place up and it didn't meet my expectations. Seems to work for others though just not my type of jam."
39,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,1/20/2022,"First timer and everything was excellent! From food to drinks to service. The cold lobster roll with salt&vinegar chips was soooo good. I prefer my lobster rolls on the toast buns but their bun at saltie girl wasn't so bad. We tried all of the oysters available at the time and they were all delicious and even better if you add the little vinegar and hot sauce. The fried clams were a small portion for $28. Granted they were good but not for $28. Definitely try the Pear if you want a cocktail. 

When we got our oysters, there were 2 extra oysters which we didn't understand why. Maybe some were small so they compensated and gave us extra? When we got the bill, turned out we were charged for the extra 2 oysters. The server said it was his mistake that he keyed in the order wrong so the kitchen prepared it wrong. He happily took the two oysters off the bill and continuously apologized. He was so so sweet. A+ in customer service!"
40,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,11/7/2021,"We sat outside on their patio on a chilly Saturday evening, which was cold even with the heat lamps on, but bearable :). 

Their warm spiced rum Apple cocktail was excellent. We shared a number of their tapas. The beet salad stole the show among the tapas. The salmon belly was pretty good but quite pricey for a very small portion. In the larger dishes, the  halibut was outstanding. The cioppino was pretty good and large although I wouldn't recommend getting the lobster as an add on. 

But all in all a very good place. I would definitely try it again!!"
41,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,2/25/2022,"Over price brunch, really nice decor, staffs were really nice but the food was okay. $22 for smoked salmon Benedict, the flavor was so basic. One cocktail is about $16 so we decided to order a bottle champagne with orange juice for party of 6 for $70. 

My friend order a burger, it was really good, juicy and tender burger. 

Small portion for steak and egg, we get about 5 pieces of steak with an egg. 

Their sour dough bread with butter was great, it was warm and fluffy."
42,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,10/9/2021,"My my, where to start. I went to college for four years in Boston and always was dying to try this restaurant and didn't get to until after I graduated and visited Boston again, and let me tell you, it's worth the hype! 

Saltie girl has the freshest, highest quality seafood, and you can taste the difference. Nestled in a corner off Newbury St, it's got a cute upscale pink marine theme and a cozy place. 

Torched Salmon Belly - this was absolutely delicious. It was fatty, fresh salmon belly laid atop a bed of perfectly ripe avocado. The salmon was one of the best salmon I'd tried. However, my one complaint is that they definitely could have given salmon belly pieces.  

Gloucester lobster roll - a New England favorite. This is a must-order here, it's a buttery hot roll stuffed to the brim with fresh hot lobster. It's market price ($38 when we went) and comes with a side of their Saltie Girl Salt and Vinegar chips. The lobster was so tender, bursting with that fresh, juicy salty lobster flavor entwined with butter. Needless to say, this was devoured in minutes. The roll is not a massive roll so keep that in mind but they don't skimp on the lobster. 

Saltie Girl Beef Burger - this is a classic burger with a chunk of fried lobster right on top. They are very generous with the portion here. Their burger was good, but personally I would not order a burger here again as their seafood is really the star of the show. The fries were also pretty average, but again, this is a seafood joint. The price was pretty hefty for this burger too, $26. 

Oysters - another must-order! They are the freshest oysters I've ever had, perfectly briny and sweet. Can't go wrong here. 

TL;DR: highly recommend for their seafood. I don't care too much for their non-seafood options but their seafood is a must! We did not order the fried lobster waffles but heard those are a must as well."
43,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,3/27/2022,Food was very good and the atmosphere is cool. Prices are ridicules in my opinion but it was the best lobster roll I ever had. Im from the NYC area so Im far from cheap but not just this place but Boston in general in my opinion is toooo overpriced. How ever if you don't mind spending 100+$ .. Salty Girl is worth it. Wait staff was great. And like I said the atmosphere is very cool. Parking is miserable. Makes me grateful for Manhattan or Brooklyn parking.
44,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,9/5/2021,"Mixed bag of pros and cons. Made a reservation 2 months in advance and looked forward to this highly acclaimed restaurant, but honestly, I've had way better. 

+ clam chowder (bacon was nice) 
+ succotash 
+ bread (super charred and topped with flaky salt) 

+/- cold lobster roll was okay, not the best I've had 
+/- decor was cute, acoustics were wack 

- service was mehhhhh. Food runners dropped off plates and didn't explain any accoutrements. No steak knife with the steak, dirty plates were taken away but clean plates were not replaced. 
- cocktails were a major letdown. They do not look cute as previously advertised. They all come in boring cups with no garnishes. 
- it's sad that the sides were better than the entrees. 
- $400 + and wasn't memorable"
45,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,9/9/2021,"The ambience is amazing!  Cocktails are great!  However, the kitchen closed at 8:45p and our reservation was at 8:30p.   I felt rushed in regards to placing an order.   

Ordered the halibut.  I thought it was good but not amazing.  They had limited items on the menu...I wanted to order the pizza with caviar that was on their IG.  The warm crab roll was delicious!  And I would recommend the rock crab carbonara pasta! 

The staff was beyond amazing and attentive.  We had Fritz and we loved him!  

Side street parking only....so we ubered to/from our hotel.  T"
46,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,9/25/2021,"The details given to each dish make this a unique place. The drinks are also quite fun. My favorite is the Bloody Mary which is served with an oyster shooter.
The charted octopus starter was tender inside and nicely spiced. The chorizo in the sauce doesn't overpower the dish.
The lobster roll was super buttery. I got the hot version. The meat was sweet and didn't even need the lemon.
The cioppino was also very unique. The cuttlefish pasta really sets off the presentation while the fresh seafood speaks to your soul!"
47,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,9/10/2021,"I went to Saltie Girl assuming I would order the Yelply famous Snow Crab Toast and when I took my first bite I was flummoxed--flummoxed, I say--by how freaking good it was. 

I QR coded the menu to review what could possibly be in it to be so delectable. It just says ""avocado, pistachios, stracciatella"". 

I looked up stracciatella and one site said ""it's an Italian soft cheese-a mixture of mozzarella, buffalo milk, and cream that is rich and buttery.""

That sounds yummy. Combined with the delicate crab salad, the avo, and the crumbled pistachio sprinkled on top, and the thick toasted Italian bread...it makes for one of the best things I've ever tasted. Thanks for that, Saltie Girl!"
48,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,8/31/2021,"One of the members of our party has a friend that lived in Boston and she highly recommended Saltie Girl. That girl ain't never lied!

The host was incredibly friendly and welcoming, really setting the tone for a great meal. We started with the French bread. It's a bit expensive for essentially a chunk of bread, and I wish it would have come in four pieces for our table of four instead of three, but it was everything. I never would have thought to add salt to bread, but it really took it to another level. The bread should come with a knife, the standard utensils at the table are no match for this bread. Do yourself a favor and get some of this!

I love carbonara and find it's not super easy to get these days, even many Italian restaurants don't seem to carry this type of dish so I was all over this and was glad that I did, I loved it. The noodles are not your traditional spaghetti and that just added to the fun and flavor.

Others had the lobster and waffles, burger, and lobster roll. Everyone left the table more than satisfied!"
49,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/12/2022,"Just finishing up brunch here - glad I stopped by as the Bloody Mary and food are amazing. I started off with the Bloody Mary followed by the bluefin tuna crudo, warm spicy crab roll, the chowda and torched smoked salmon belly. All of the dishes are on the smaller side (as advertised) but flavorful and of high quality. Would return here in a heartbeat."
50,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,8/21/2021,"My friend and I were in from out of town, and wanted our first breakfast/brunch to be a solid one. 

So happy we got to Saltie Girl just as they opened, and after a few mimosas, we had the cold lobster roll and the fried lobster and waffle dish. The latter was a recommendation from the waitstaff, and it was the perfect blend of sweet and savory that I was looking for in a brunch. 

Highly recommend this spot, and the outdoor patio was super cute too."
51,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,10/5/2021,"Highlights:
* Upscale seafood in a casual environment
* Only a few seats inside but plenty of outdoor seating
* The word is out so have a reservation
* Creative Presentations and knowledgable servers

The shoppers, tourists and locals on Newbery Street know some of the best upscale seafood can be found at Saltie Girl. With very limited indoor seating your best bet is to sit outside when the weather is nice. Be sure to have a reservation as the outside seating fills up fast. Inside is a quaint Back Bay brownstone with a few booths and some bar seating.

We started with some Perrier Jouet Champagne and Momo Sauvignon Blanc available by the glass and a great accompaniment to a dozen fresh littleneck clams served with cocktail sauce, lemon, house mignonette and house spicy sauce. Next up was the Torched Salmon Belly with avocado, apple, cucumber and miso glaze. The Shima Aji, aka striped jack, may have been a special, and was quite good. Day Boat Scallop Crudo was served with Caviar, jalapeño, lime and avocado and reasonably priced at $18 for a caviar dish. Fried Lobster and Waffles is a signature dish served with sweet corn butter and spicy maple syrup $32. The Spicy Crab Roll, two pieces of crab rolled with avocado and sesame coated soy paper $28, was delicious as was everything else. 

We could not leave Boston without sampling the clam chowder, as we did all around town. Saltie Girls' is certainly in the top 5, made with salsify and bacon. For dessert our waiter suggested the Fig Tart, fresh roasted figs served over a pastry shell and topped with ice cream and an edible flower.

If you are visiting and only have time to try a few seafood restaurants, be sure to put Saltie Girl on your list, space and weather permitting."
52,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,12/29/2021,"We came here on a recommendation of a friend. Honestly, I probably would have liked this place more if I came with my bf and just shared a platter of oysters and enjoyed a cocktail, rather than coming here with my family. The portions are small, especially for the price, and you shouldn't come here starving without ordering a lot of food.

Location: Easy to find in Back Bay. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, but this place does get crowded.

Ambiance: Trendy, can get loud.

Service: Service was ok. Maybe I got the vibe our waitress was disappointed we only ordered one dish per person and got water (I was hydrating for my marathon, so no alcohol for me). It was borderline uninviting.

Food: I ordered the snow crab toast, my sister ordered the fried lobster and waffle, my dad got the lobster roll, and my mom ordered the king crab roll and chowder. All of the food was good, but the king crab roll was a disappointing portion size, especially for the price.

Price: Trendy comes with a price.

Would I return? Maybe if it were for a date night or to try the cioppino, which looked really good."
53,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,8/26/2021,"Something about the humidity and not having airflow in the bar area made me want to leave early. Those poor employees. 

The clam chowder was good, but on the thin side. I like mine a bit chunkier. 

I also ordered the snow crab toast and I don't understand the hype. The crab and toast were good separately. But too acidic. Pistachios? stracciatella cheese? Avocado? Honestly, If you're a fatty like me, I would pass on this. A lot of people like it, so try it, I guess?? To each their own."
54,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,12/12/2021,"This place gets booked fast! Make a reservation and be sure to try the lobster roll. Took a trip here to relax and see the sights. The passion fruit cocktail is strong but refreshing. I can't wait to go back when the weather warms up a bit. 

The vibe is cool and you can dine in or out. The bar scene is perfect for a meet and greet or date night with bae. 

Get here!"
55,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/24/2022,"I'm very impressed by the food, especially fried black bass, huge and solid with Asian fusion taste. I ordered pineapple rum cocktail that is perfect with seafood we ordered tonight. Only one dish not recommended is sea urchin, a little fishy because it's from New England. You can get better one in Japanese restaurant. Other than that, everything is exceptional!"
56,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/17/2022,"WOW!!! I cannot wait to come back. The burger was full of so many bursting flavors. The pork belly was the best I have had. The lobster was a fantastic edition. I enjoyed the vibe and quiet, elegant hum throughout the restaurant."
57,Saltie Girl,2 star rating,9/18/2021,"I'm sorry, but this girl is now very saltie.  We came in here with high expectations given the ratings and while most of the food was above average and decently priced, there were two major issues.  
Most importantly was the service.  It took a long time to order and the waitress rarely checked in on our table.  They were also out of multiple dishes on a Saturday night.

The stuffed lobster was ridiculously priced at $65/lb and again not poor in quality, but nowhere near the return in value.  

The menu is also not friendly to those with a nut allergy per the waitress, even though no nuts are listed on the menu. 

Boston is a great city with many restaurants and I guarantee you'll find better elsewhere."
58,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,7/5/2021,"Came back here again when was back in Boston to visit. This time was for lunch and the experience was way better than the first time. 

We ordered oysters, snow crab toast, warm lobster roll, uni quail egg and caviar (sushi?), and grilled octopus. 

Oysters were fresh. The snow crab toast was the best I've had- It was so so so good! I am not a bread person but the toast was so good, crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside with a nice smoky taste. I would go back just for the snow crab toast. The lobster roll was so delicious that I forgot the take a picture before chowing it down. The sea urchin with quail egg and caviar was good but could've been better, I think they used too much rice, which overpowered the goodies. The octopus wasn't my favorite, was supposed be an appetizer but came in the very end. 

Service was decent."
59,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,9/6/2021,"Fresh seafood and nice atmosphere sitting outside. Service was superb. Brook was our sever and she was super friendly and helpful. She was knowledgeable and gave us great recommendations. We ordered oysters (amazing), avocado with charred salmon, raw salmon with jalapeño and urchin from Japan. 
I highly recommend it although it's very pricey."
60,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,12/8/2021,"We stopped here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. No wait and quick service. The interior was so cute and well designed/laid out. We had the warm Lobster Roll and the Fried Calamari. The bread for the Lobster Roll was amazing and the meal came with a bag of salt & vinegar potato chips. The Fried Calamari was the best part though, served with a delicious aioli and Spanish chorizo - so much flavor!

It did seem a little over-priced for the taste/size, but it could have been based on what we ordered. Next time I would order from the crudo menu or a seafood tower (someone ordered this next to us and it looked delicious!)"
61,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,12/14/2021,"I've been here twice - once for take out and the other time for dining in. Saltie Girl has the best tasting Lobster roll I've tried so far in Boston (and I've tried 8 different spots now) - but it's definitely on the pricier end. 

Service 
- When I dined in, we were seated promptly and service was friendly. Waitress answered a lot of questions we had about the menu since a a number of items were marked as market price 
- We did get the wrong food delivered to our table a few times throughout the night - not a huge deal, but we did have to instruct the servers a few times.  

Atmosphere 
- The interior has pink paneled walls and a nice view onto the streets of Back Bay. Would describe the ambiance as cute and classy 

Food 
- Lobster roll comes on a hot, buttery bun with a side of chips in a bag. Lobster is delicious and the freshness of the taste definitely comes through. It is, however, $38, which is the most I've paid for a lobster roll in Boston 
- For starters, we also ordered the shishito peppers, which were not spicy at all and nicely charred. My favorite appetizer had to have been the roasted squash. SO GOOD. Would come back just for that. 
- We also ordered the burger, which was delicious. Thick, juicy beef patty with lots of cheese. 
- Wine selection was good and glasses were fairly priced 
- Two of my friends got the 2LB baked stuffed lobster, which I believe was just under $150. Presentation was beautiful but not sure if it was worth the price. 

Overall, this is a solid spot for date night or a fancier night out, but expect it to be on the pricier side"
62,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"Being new to Boston what better place to eat than seafood off Newbury street. It's a fairly popular place, so we put down our names for a table and got a text pretty soon afterwards for a table. 

For drinks they have a decently long wine list as well as beer. My friend got a couple glasses of cava and seemed pretty content with that. 

For the food, we splurged for the seafood tower as well as a couple of other entrees, the snow crab toast, diver scallops, and the lobster roll. Dunno how we finished but we did. 

The grande seafood tower, market price was $150 that day. It included shrimp and crab cocktail, truffled lobster salad, tuna poke, east and west coast oysters as well as small and large neck clams. We discovered we were not a fan of raw clams, but the oyster selection was pretty good. 

The snow crab toast was amazing. Large pile of snow crab on a bed of avocado and creamy stracciatella. The bread itself was great - buttered, seedy, and toasted. The diver scallops were also a winner especially if you like fried seafood. The tartar sauce was one of my favorites and the scallops were crispy on the outside but perfectly succulent and tender on the inside. Seasoning for the scallops and fries were just perfect. 

I'm indifferent to lobster especially since I've been in Maine for the last couple months, but that's not to say that this lobster roll wasn't good. Drfinitely"
63,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,6/21/2021,"I came here with my girlfriend and we started off with the raw bar, choosing a few oysters and shrimp cocktail. The raw bar was my favorite item, and all the seafood items were really fresh. We then split the charred octopus, seared tuna flatbread, salmon belly, and artichokes for dinner. The octopus was essentially octopus in a bowl of marinara. It could have used a little more seasoning. The salmon belly was good, but you get a really small portion for the price you pay. The tuna flatbread was essentially a pizza with tuna and a lot of arugula on top. 

For the hype that this place gets, and how expensive some of the dishes are, I think there are better spots in the city that are worth the money. Overall, the food was good, but I don't think it was worth the price."
64,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,12/14/2021,"My friend and I came here for lunch. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. My friend got the cider cocktail, which was good. We both got the lobster rolls, and had it cooked warm (you could pick between warm or cold). The lobster was very good on a brioche roll. It was a little too buttery for my taste but my friend loved it! The rolls come with salt and vinegar chips, but you could substitute if you wanted. It is on the pricier side, I just got the lobster roll, no drink, and after tip, it cost about $50."
65,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,12/1/2021,"Convenient spot for sure, but you pay for it. The chips made in-house were ok, but a nice novelty- could have been a little more crispy. Oysters were delicious but a little on the expensive end. Truffle fries were AWESOME- highly recommend.

All in all, a great atmosphere and I'd recommend this for a stop on your shopping day."
66,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,11/8/2021,Saltie Girl expanded significantly in space ever since it moved to this new location. It's a lot easier now to get a seat and -- contrary to my previous review -- they now have updated to the modern day reservation system. That's a significant plus. See my pictures for recommended dishes.
67,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,1/3/2022,"Haven't went back in a while but I went there today and the decor and ambience has completely changed! Everything looks fancier and high-end, very pretty. 

Food-wise, everything was still super great! I got their hot lobster roll, lobster & waffles and cod and they were all great. My favorite is always their lobster and waffles though with the delicious mix of sweet and savory from the maple syrup and butter. 10/10!"
68,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,4/11/2022,"Just a quick dinner at the bar to enjoy a 'last night in Boston' lobster roll.  Very happy with our choice- had the warm roll, sooo good.  Had a side of fries- home cut variety.  Great service at the lower bar and great food."
69,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,11/24/2021,"Wow! Really impressed by the seafood food and drinks here, and definitely would come back! 

If you're looking for a fun day-time brunch with friends or even a casual-yet-elevated dinner date (think 3rd date vibes), I highly recommend. The food is spot-on; the ambience is fun and flirty (pink walls, leather cushioned booths, chandelier in the entrance); the price can climb quickly though! 

Here's what I had (and recommend!):

[Cocktail] Blood Orange - Very fruit forward! Texture is like a light smoothie. And if you like drinks that don't have an alcohol finish, you'll be a fan. My other friends tried the apple and fig cocktails. The impression I had from their experience was that the apple is perfect if you want a spiced, warm hard apple cider, and the fig is perfect for a more bourbon-forward/complex drink.  

[Appetizer] Torched Salmon Belly - My three friends and I split this one. To be honest, it's a very small plate. Think palm-sized salmon topped with sliced avocado. It is one of their more popular appetizers, and I enjoyed the taste. Just keep in mind the portion size! 

[Entree / Large Plate] Fried Lobster & Waffles - Awesome! I'm such a fan and would recommend to anyone who goes. The fried lobster had a great texture and the flavor still comes through! And waffles and spicy maple syrup really adds an elevated touch and makes brunch that much more enjoyed. Don't worry about the spice though - it's not that strong! 

Overall, 5/5! Would highly recommend to friends and family! Just keep an eye on the final price."
70,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/9/2022,"Upscale seafood dinner, on point!

Came for dinner on a Monday night in March 2022, everything was amazing -

West Coast oysters, raw
Torched salmon belly
Lobster roll - we are firm believers in the warm with butter, and this was inline with the one from Neptune's oyster ($38 was the Saltie Girl market price, when we came)
Moules Frites - this is bathed in a luscious white wine Butter sauce, emphasis on butter. This is a full on entree to share, the butter sauce was so luscious and indulgent, with a hint of chilis to give it the perfect balance. Mountain of fries served on top, with parmesan- somehow it all works. 

Will be back!!"
71,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,5/11/2021,"Enjoyed a wonderful mother's day lunch at Saltie Girl this past weekend. They expanded their original tiny restaurant into the Met space and started taking reservations this past year. The service, food, and ambiance were all top notch. We ordered a variety of dishes including: 

1. Steak tartare (Definitely get this! Delicious, creamy, and generous portion)
2. Torched salmon belly (Salmon was great but I would pass next time, nothing special and small portion compared to the other dishes)
3. Day boat scallop crudo (YES, order it. This was my favorite dish, the texture of the scallops was so smooth and fresh)
4. Uni toast (Would order again but pricey, get this if you are an uni fan)
5. Lobster roll (Decent lobster roll but would not order again unless you are specifically in the mood for one. Comparable to other restaurants in Boston) 
6. Rock crab carbonara (Order if you are looking for something more filling and creamy) 
7. Upside down strawberry rhubarb cake (I would pass on this next time, not my cup of tea)

We also ordered a mimosa and the frozen espresso cocktail. The latter was so so delicious and boozy. 

Overall, definitely worth it and I will be coming back!"
72,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,12/14/2021,"The chilll wore off soon as those drinks came! Enjoyed a dirty gin martini and the Pear cocktail. Lots of windows and an early reservation required a bundle up but like I said....get your drink and it'll be warm in no time!! Loved the lobster n waffles and the cioppino. Very fresh cuttlefish pasta and shellfish with loads of flavor!! Maybe choose the longest on a cold day or maybe turn up the heat. Today was a milder day. Wonder what its like on really cold day!! 
Enjoy!"
73,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,6/8/2021,"Overall, had a good experience and the food was tasty.

Not unexpected, but it's definitely pricey (Lobster Roll was $38 at Market Rate this time) which was more than I expected. Would be nice if it came with fries instead of chips. Probably wouldn't get it again for the price, even though it was tasty.

I really enjoyed the waffle from the Lobster and Waffles. Honestly was one of the best waffles I've ever had. The Fried Lobster was an interesting item to experience...though I think when it's fried, it really looses the distinct ""Lobster taste"" that I'd expect

The Clam chowder was delicious! First time having a clam chowder with fried clams, so was quite the treat.

The drinks were well blended and tasty. And when I ordered one that was a bit too bitter for me, they gladly added some simple syrup to it for me.

And the Lemon Florentine cake dessert was good as well. Definitely full of lemon flavor for sure. I wish it would have been more moist, but it was still tasty."
74,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,5/18/2021,"Saltie Girl serves delicious seafood and drinks in the heart of back bay in Boston near Copley square. Outdoor seating available for walk up only, you can only reserve for indoor dining. The lobster roll is in my opinion the best you will find in Boston, seriously, their hot lobster roll is addictive I haven't even managed to try the cold one. They also serve it with house made salt and vinegar chips which is always a nice touch.

If you're not up for the lobster roll, I recommend the chowder and the mussels which is served with divine bread- the sauce is delicious! They also have a great array of oysters from across the US

To finish it off, the chocolate mousse between layers of filo is decadent and the perfect amount of sweet. 

For drinks I love their cocktails - both the grapefruit and the watermelon are delicious. 

You can't go wrong here, excellent staff/service and even better food! It's worth the hype and price.

75,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,11/4/2021,A friend recommend for us to try Saltie Girl while visiting and we're glad we did. The seafood was super fresh and the interior was the perfect ambiance for a date or brunch with your girlfriends. The price is a bit higher in the area but you are paying for a more upscale atmosphere as well! I loved the refreshing cocktails and lobster roll - would love to try the clam chowder and crab toast next time!
76,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,7/3/2021,"This is one of my favorite places to go when I'm in Boston! I love it so much I break my rule about not visiting places more than once in cities I do not live in, but I make an exception since I went to grad school at Northeastern. 

Every bite and sip we had in this place was phenomenal. 

The service is impeccable and so friendly. We recommend sitting at the bar so you can watch the action and magic happen. 

Now let's talk food. Oh, the lobster roll. First off, there is so much lobster in this roll it is worth the cost. The toasted buttered roll is overflowing with lobster. The potato chips are not your regular chips either. These are perfectly salted and crispy. 

We had the market fish, and it was out of this world!! The sauce and the chutney on top perfectly complimented every soft bite of the fish. 

Last but not least, we had the snow crab toast. There was so much snow crab with pistachios, avocado, and stracciatella. The toast was buttered and toasted to crispy perfection. 

I do not recall the drinks we had as I forgot to take pictures, but I'm sure it was on their cocktail menu, and it was delectable."
77,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"For drink i started with the cranberry, which was fruity and refreshing. And for entree I got the steak tartare and i would definitely come back for this! I'm a cheese lover and I already knew I would love it, but it was the brioche and the steak that got me hooked. Ended the meal with the black and tan tart, which was also delicious and not overly sweet."
78,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/30/2022,"If you love yellowtail, then the yellowtail at Saltie Girl is a perfect choice. A favorite of mine while traveling in Boston. Must try! The salmon belly had a great smoky taste but mine was a bit cold so wasn't sure if that's how the fish was suppose to come out. Otherwise the margaritas were delicious and the location was perfect"
79,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,10/16/2021,"Tried to get reservations and could not so we just dropped by hoping to get a table outside. We were told 30min wait but got a table within 10mins. The place was busy while it was not packed. We had two small plates and shared an entree. We had the salmon belly and the crab toast. The salmon belly was good, the crab toast needed something, there was a lot of crab which was great but it needed something to kick it up. The bread was tasty. Next we shared the hamburger which was pretty good. We also had a grapefruit cocktail and a pineapple cocktail both were awesome. The service was pretty good and the waitress was knowledgeable. The seafood is definitely pricey."
80,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,6/20/2021,"Amazing seafood! Saltie girl has a reputation and they definitely live up to it. Ever since they expanded and took over the Met it's been easy to get in or place a reservation.

Our waiter was hilarious, I don't remember his name, but service was great. We ordered the following:

Tuna crudo ($16)
Salmon belly ($19)
Saltie girl burger ($26)
Dessert - can't remember maybe $12

The salmon belly is sooooo goood! A must! The tuna was also great but it had these little pickled mushrooms that overpowered the flavor of the dish. We took them off and I think they have changed it anyways. The burger was super good and also extremely rich. I'd have a hard time eating the whole thing so I'm glad we shared it!

Overall, Saltie Girl has amazing food and it's a great date spot in Boston. It's a little expensive to frequent often but I'd highly recommend trying it if you are visiting Boston!"
81,Saltie Girl,2 star rating,10/11/2021,"Soooooooo it's a no from me. My friend said this place is a must go to. So this was my first meal the second I got to Boston. Umm.. NO!!! Save your money. 

We made resos a week in advance. Arrived on time and we're seated quickly. My friend and I were starving!!! We ordered 2 cocktails and put in an order for appetizers while we looked and narrowed it down on our end. 

We ordered the petite seafood platter- HORRIBLE. I live for seafood and just no. The shrimp was over cooked/over boiled and was beyond chewy. The clams and oysters were so Sandy they were not edible. And then the lobster salad was so salty we left it as is. 

We also got the uni- 5/5 this was very edible and delicious. 

2 food items and 2 cocktails and we were already over 200$ we asked for the check immediately and we were out in 20 minutes scrambling to find a new dinner spot."
82,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,11/9/2021,"I decided to come here yesterday for lunch as I love tinned seafood and this place has an abundant selection.  I find the menu intimidating so I asked the bartender for help.  The Snow Crab Toast was huge and bland tasting.  Pretty much tasteless Crab and Avocado on a huge slab of toast.  The tinned Mussels in Lemon were ok.  The slabs of bread are huge which takes away from the fish and other parings in my opinion.  The Italian Cab was mediocre.  The Bartender was nice but I could tell he was overworked.  I'm not sure I'd return as I wasn't impressed with the food, but the atmosphere is nice.  The drink menu also left a lot to be desired."
83,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/31/2021,"OKAY YUM. Keep Saltie Girl in mind when you want to splurge on a meal because this place can get expensive, but is a must try! I mean it is seafood AND on Newbury St so you must have known it would be $$$. Just FYI they are currently serving at Met Back Bay. 

We made reservations on a Sunday at 4 and it was BUSSSSY. Parking was tough. Get here early so you're not driving around frantically looking for parking 5 minutes before your reservation like I was lol.

Everything was delish. I wish our fries were more crispy and wish they had brought our apps out before our main meal, but I won't take a star out for that. It was so good - make your reservation now!"
84,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,4/12/2021,"Back again! My friend and I were shopping on Newbury Street and wanted to get the saltie girl burgers to eat in one of the parks, so we ordered for pick up. Wait was around one hour, according to the delivery app we used, and when we went right on time, the order was already ready.

Fries unfortunately were not hot and crispy the way they were in-restaurant, but the burger was still good even though it was kind of lukewarm already. They packaged everything in a way that made it kind of hard to eat the burger -- and forgot to give us any utensils or napkins. We went back and got some once we realized that they were missing. Everything was still good, but I definitely won't do delivery/pick up again, since the food tasted only ~70% as good as it normally does!"
85,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,11/17/2021,"Hailed as a trendy brunch/seafood spot, we had to come try and see what the hype was about. While a bit pricey, the seafood is fresh and portions are ample. I opted for a classic hot lobster roll with their signature vinegar and salt chips and my partner got the lobster and waffles. 

Lobster roll was buttery, oozing with lobster and mayo (sorry if that was slightly graphic). Perfectly seasoned with lots of lobster meat. Chips were yummy and not much else to say beyond it was a damn good lobster roll. 

Lobster and waffle on the other hand, was an otherworldly experience and a MUST TRY! Corn butter with spicy batter fried lobster atop soft and crunchy waffles? And maple syrup? No other way to describe the flavors aside from they were all there and perfect!! 10/10 recommended!"
86,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,5/23/2021,"Got the warm lobster rolls and they were really good! I love that they were served on a brioche bun which made it so much tastier, and had the perfect amount of butter. However, the lobster roll was extremely small and not filling at all, so it was most definitely not worth the price tag at all. 

The salt and vinegar chips also disappointed me. While the texture of the chip was great, the vinegar taste was extreme strong and the chip itself was just WAY too salty, so was not a huge fan of those."
87,Saltie Girl,2 star rating,10/6/2021,"Two stars is generous. Sorry to say, but I looked at several menus in the area and figured this looked good. Super disappointed. A bad day is one thing but there was sooo nothing special here. I had visions of deliciousness and at the end of my meal - I was pretty bummed out that I didn't order lightly and get something yummy elsewhere. Walls and baseboard were a little dirty and unappealing too, sorry but in the daylight it was just not what I imagined after finally trying this place after seeing the high ratings. Here is the steak tartare I got from there vs a small french restaurant in Hyannis...flavors paled in comparison. I may have to drive to the Cape. 
I get it..  rent on Newbury St isn't cheap, but flavor and flair isn't expensive, it keeps them coming back. Sorry for the review but really disappointed!"
88,Saltie Girl,2 star rating,10/6/2021,"Going to keep it short and to the point - service was okay. Food was meh- I had high expectations of this place because the reviews are great on here. Wasn't impressed and the prices are astronomical, in my opinion, for no reason. Portions aren't reasonable for the price. Not understanding the hype? Steak tartare was ok.... Needed capers or something, lacking flavor. Snow crab toast, appeared better than it tasted, very bland. Moules and frites? Okay- again bland. Over a $200 tab and not memorable whatsoever. 

Disappointed... Not even going to post the pictures because the presentation appears better than the food tastes."
89,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,3/5/2021,"My friend and I were looking for a last minute reservation for good seafood and I'm so glad we found this place! It was very easy to book online. Note that they have moved to the building next door. We almost turned back because the door with the sign is actually closed. No worries, we called them and realized they're just next door. 

We were seated in the basement. It was pretty dim. All the staff wore masks and were very nice. The menu has a lot of delicious sounding items and it was very difficult to decide what to get. After our server's recommendation, we decided on Snow Crab Toast and Lobster Rolls. 

Snow Crab Toast: oh my, this is an elevated avocado toast. It is actually pretty tall. It has layers of avocado, cheese and crab. Drizzled with pistachio and olive oil. It was absolutely delicious. 

Lobster Roll: ok can we just appreciate the custom packaged chips? The lobster roll looks small in size, but don't be fooled, the buttery lobster is actually pretty hefty serving. The roll was so fresh and soft. Almost melt in the mouth. 

+1 for amazing service. I had plenty of water refills, and trust me that's not too common during covid. 

Taking one star off because the food is upscale and a little on the pricey side, however the basement vibes definitely did not match the upscale feels they're going for."
0,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/25/2022,"The size of this location is pretty standard for a ramen shop. The menu is smaller than the larger Cambridge location but all you need is a good bowl of Kara miso ramen. It comes in three different sizes. Small, regular, and large (sizes changes are +/- $1). To make the bowl complete, add an egg for $2. Usually there isn't enough meat for me so I order an extra side of meat (only when I order a large, I don't need it when I get a regular)

If dining in is still not in the cards for you, don't worry they have takeout and delivery options. They package it very nicely in a single container and provide a nice soup spoon and chopsticks. It is so space efficient, I should've taken a picture but I couldn't restrain myself. They wrap it in plastic in case it spills during transit as well! The noodles, veggies and meat are in the upper compartment while the soup base is at the bottom of the cup (a big soup cup)."
1,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,3/30/2022,"The hard working staff here deserve a shout out. Their job looks exhausting, hustling to get people in and out while still maintaining quality. They all did it tirelessly. 

Other than that, this experience was alright. Long wait for pretty good ramen. There's more or less one vegetarian ramen. Upcharge to add an egg. This ramen had some tasty things about it, but the broth unfortunately fell into the trap of bland veggie broths. I think this is a good benchmark for quality, since it takes effort to make flavorful veggie broth.

Space is tiny. You will be literally brushing elbows with strangers. If your party isn't large enough for its own table, you will share. This is fine and didn't put a big damper on my experience. But be advised you will wait and if you are still at all covid cautious, this one is very much not for you."
2,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,3/27/2022,"Good ramen, but generally overrated. Does not compare to ramen you could find in NYC or California. The noodles are prepackaged and some of the broths have an underwhelming flavor. The vegetarian ramen is pretty disappointing. I did enjoy the shio broth. Although I wish they would be a bit more generous with toppings, I usually leave here full.

It is often busy during lunch time and you can expect a small line. The staff will try to get you in and out so they can free up seats for the next customer. The food does come out fast, so for a quick, satisfying lunch that won't break the bank, it's not a bad choice."
3,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,3/6/2022,"We went to the Newbury St location and we waited from 8 to 8:30 in line last Saturday night for two people. No reservations because they know they're that good. It's quite a small shop instead so be prepared to wait. I thought the ramen was definitely some of the better ramen in Boston but doesn't compare to NYC area ramen. Then again the NYC ramen prices are extravagant compared to this $15 filling meal, tip and tax included. I really enjoyed the soup which was hearty and went really well with the noodles. Not to be picky, but I some minor improvements are as follows (sorry, I'm a ramen connoisseur in training): 
- the pieces of pork were very dry and there were only two gum sized pieces. 
- the noodles themselves didn't have the super bouncy texture of superior quality ramen."
4,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,4/7/2022,"Parking took 40 minutes to find and the we waited another 40 minutes to dine in. The space inside is very small so seating is limited, hence the reason why there will probabaly be a line almost everytime you go because of how popular this location is.  We ordered what we wanted before seating inside through the waitress and when it was finally time to sit in, food arrived in less than 5 minutes. They have three sizes for the bowls of ramen for those that want less or more. I was extremely satisfied with my dish as it was super flavorful and the noodles were perfectly chewy. I highly reccomend the shio broth as it had a more rich flavor than the shoyu ramen. The chashu was soft and juicy which suited well with the broth."
5,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,2/22/2022,"I didn't find anything particularly special about this ramen. The noodles were not particularly thin or refined, the toppings on the basic bowl are rather sparse - but luckily that is reflected in the price. I didn't think the broth had much flavor beyond being salty. The best part of the dish was probably the pork belly, the fish cake was a sad distraction.

It's a tiny place with no real place to hang up your coats, so eat precariously!"
6,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,1/12/2022,"Our party of 3 waited for an hour in the cold but it made the bowl of ramen that much more tasty!! 

It's a really small store which is why the wait can be longer. 

The spice level was great & the texture of the ramen was chewy (how I like it). The egg was runny and the broth was delicious! I opted for a size large and I almost finished it... especially since we were waiting outside in the cold for a while

Our friends and I all enjoyed our ramen bowls!"
7,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/5/2022,"Probably one of my favorite ramen places here in Boston but nothing will beat Ichiran in New York . 

Very small place. Probably 6-7 tables max and probably a 6 seater on the counter top. Be prepared to wait to be seated because the line is always long. I usually stick to the spicy miso with corn and egg on the side. I really wished they had more veggies in the ramen for example bean sprouts . But it's a must try!"
8,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,4/5/2022,"We ordered the combo ramen with 2 side items. I got the karamiso (spicy broth), chashu gohan (rice bowl with pork), and Ajitama (marinated egg). The broth was perfectly spicy and rich. Gohan was simple but very solid in flavor. Egg flavor was also amazing and cooked to perfection. The combo was very reasonably price and more than enough to fill you up. One of my favorite ramen places in Boston thus far!"
9,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,10/31/2021,"Came here on a whim when we were in Boston. It was not on my radar at all when I did all the research for where to go eat but we walked by it on the way back to the hotel one day and saw the line of people waiting outside so we decided to check it out for lunch on our last day in Boston. 

We waited about 25min before being seated. The tables are extremely tight and you're most likely seated with others since they don't have individual tables. We were disappointed that this was some kind of express location and most of the dishes we wanted to order weren't available. We got the Kara miso ramen which was pretty good, especially after waiting in line outside on a cold fall day. We also ordered the mazeman (dry ramen dish) because I read some reviews that raves about it. I didn't care for it at all - it was too salty and just very blah. 

Service was friendly and speedy, prices were super reasonable, and the bathroom was super clean and surprisingly huge considering how small the restaurant was as a whole. I would be interested in visiting its other locations with the full menu in the future."
10,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"This is my favorite ramen place in Boston/ Cambridge area. They serve delicious ramen, which explains the long wait times/ queue even in the chilly Boston winters.
Highly recommended!!"
11,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,3/28/2022,"First time in Boston, first stop. Very delicious. I've been to Hokkaido's near LA, not the best. Very small and intimate shop, Good ramen noodle soup. Thank you Santouka."
12,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/21/2022,"The ramen here was absolutely delicious - every element blew us away! The broth was amazingly flavorful, the noodles had the right amount of bounce and chew, and the chashu was savory and tender. We got the large tonkotsu shio ramen and small tonkotsu miso ramen, and we loved how we were able to customize the size accordingly. So glad we stopped in during our walk through Newbury Street. The warm soup definitely hit the spot on such a cold, windy day."
13,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/15/2022,"I stopped by Santouka in a middle of running errands on a cold wintery day. There was around 30-minute wait to get inside. As commented in prior reviews, the Back-Bay location is very small (seats around 16-20 people at a time). Santouka's ramen might be my favorite in Boston and has great value (around $10-12/ramen, and extra 2-3 for other toppings)

Atmosphere (4/5):
The space is small and crowded, with you sharing either the table or the bar space with other parties. There is not much decoration, but it is cute, efficient and serves its purpose of churning out delicious ramen quickly.

Food (5/5):
Really delicious authentic ramen. I got the shoyu ramen with additional aji-tama(soft boiled egg with extra $2). You have the option of either small, regular or large portion, which was wonderful to be able to customize. The baraniku(pork belly) cha-shu literally melts in your mouth, and is a beautiful savory explosion. The egg is also perfectly done. The broth is not overly salty with a rich and complex pork flavor and with great ratio of noodles/soup. The thin noodles were fresh and cooked to the perfect al dente consistency.

Service (5/5):
The staff are really attentive and super friendly. They checked everyone's vaccination card and were efficient in taking orders and getting the food to the table. I was in and out of the place within 30 minutes."
14,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,8/22/2021,"Hm.

Honestly I was really excited for this place. Lines always out the door. Good reviews. 

I wasn't all that ""wow""ed. You know? 

Broth for all soups was just meh for me.
Nothing popped out. It didn't feel silky, wasn't too flavorful, and it was a bit heavy.

Noodles didn't make me feel like they came together with the broth either. 

Charsiu pork had no char, no flavor.

Don't get me wrong, the broth wasn't bad, it just didn't taste the best. 

I will try the location again, maybe the other location. Maybe I had a bad day."
15,Santouka Back Bay,2 star rating,7/16/2021,"I saw the line the day before and decided that I need to try this place!

I got 2 pork bowl and 1 spiciest ramen

I'd say the food was not that great :( the service was just okay but at least we got the food fast enough."
16,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,3/19/2022,"A close friend of mine has been raving about this place for a long time. So you know that she had to take me here when I came over to visit her. There's going to be a line practically at practically any time, but it does move pretty quickly. Also, the place is small and you'll end up seating next to strangers at either the bar or the tables. 

I tried the spicy miso ramen and it was good. Nice broth and noodles, but the chashu could've been better. I had really high expectations since my friend claimed this was the best ramen she has ever had. Overall, I wouldn't say it disappointed, since I did enjoy it, but it's certainly not the best. Even though, this is a must when it comes to the Boston ramen scene."
17,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"I got the shio ramen, which was super delicious. The chashu very tender, and the broth was rich and creamy. I got the small size and I finished it feeling just fine. Also recommend the pork cheeks if you want some extra protein."
18,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,4/5/2021,"My boyfriend and I stopped by this ramen spot while we were in Boston and it certainly did not disappoint!

This establishment is quite small with only 11 seats total- some at the bar and three tables. They do not take reservations, instead it is first come first serve. Luckily, when we got there, there was a short wait with only two parties ahead of us. While waiting you can scan the QR code to browse the menu. The prices are more than reasonable for the portion size of the ramen. My boyfriend and I both got the combo which was super worth it ($16. An extra $1 to size up) and it left us feeling more than satisfied. If you like a kick to your ramen the Kara Miso was delicious. The broth was rich and creamy and the add-ons from the combo completed each bite. 

Take note that there is only street parking available. There were many spots in front of the restaurant and on Newbury Street. 

This is a no-frills type of restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to satisfy their ramen craving!"
19,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,5/18/2021,"Certified addicting ramen spot! Willing to eat this anytime anywhere and it's sooo affordable. This place is a chain from Japan so you know it's legit! I always opt for the combo where you get ramen, a small side, and an ajitama (tea egg). I always choose the Karamiso because I love spicy ramen with the chashu gohan (pork belly on rice) as a side. 

My mouth is watering just writing the review! They have this location and a spot in Harvard sq which is larger and used the Yelp app for getting in line. Back Bay is old school - you have to actually wait in line so expect a wait especially during peak times! I've waited an hour before. 

With covid they've opened outside seating on the side of the road which has also been so nice!

The service is no fuss and very quick - such a great spot that you can't miss!

20,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,11/12/2021,"Decent priced, quickly served ramen. I'd opt for the larger portion for a few dollars more. This is one of those places that I don't mind stopping in between errands and grabbing lunch by myself."
21,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,2/26/2022,"+5 Great ramen at affordable pricing. 

-1 Con is that it is pretty crowded, you're literally sitting 3 inches away from ppl not in your party.

-1 Negative opinion is that it is very weird that utensils are on the table, cuz ppl could be spilling their noodles onto them, or spitting while talking. I feel they should bring out the chopsticks and spoon along with the food on the tray."
22,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,9/16/2021,"I finally stopped by this ever so busy Santouka earlier today and had a great bowl of kara miso ramen. I loved the option to get a small since I never finish a bowl of ramen, but it was a bit smaller than expected. Nevertheless, it's a fair price and the ramen was delicious. The broth was rich, noodles had a good chew, chasiu was tender, and egg was runny. It really hit the spot on the rainy day. If you are a spicy eater, they offer chili oil and flakes if requested. 

Great service, love the friendly staff."
23,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,4/23/2021,"Ate here for the first time recently. I got the curry ramen bowl combo ($17). I thought the fries in the curry bowl was a bit odd but it tasted very good. The soft boiled egg was a great included side. For my side of choice I picked the cha-su rice (white rice with pork and scallions). For a drink I just got water since their only options were bottled tea for $3 or sodas. 

Overall good experience. Service was friendly, my food tasted great, and I left full without breaking the bank (which is hard to do at a lot of restaurants in Back Bay). Would definitely come back. I wish they had more drink options though."
24,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,2/12/2022,I got the Shoyu Ramen and it was amazing! The broth tasted great and was delicious and you can tell that the ramen was freshly made too. I find that sometimes some places have more broth vs ramen but there was a good 1 to 1 ratio of noodles and broth! The restaurant is quite small so you might need to wait a bit and you'll need to share a table with other people. I would definitely come back again because it was delicious and the Shoyu Ramen I got was about 13 dollars!
25,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,9/1/2021,Came here for lunch around 1:30 pm and had a 20 minute wait for three people. It's a tiny place with a limited menu but everything was tasty. I tried the natto rice bowl and it was good-- the ratio of rice to soybeans was a bit off (huge portion of rice) and the ramen that was also ordered was great! The broth wasn't too salty (we asked for refused salt) and the pork was super fatty and good. Would definitely come back again!
26,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"I had heard from multiple Boston area natives that Santouka's ramen is the best in New England - I haven't been to other places, but the ramen here is certainly great compared to shops in NYC and San Francisco!

+ Delicious food: the eggs, salmon ikura bowls, and ramen here are delicious. With regards to the ramen - the broth is exceptional, toppings taste great, and noodles have perfect texture. The only area that could use improvement is the chashu - it could be softer and smokier - this was a 3/5 because the meat did taste a little tough.

+ Great value: Ramen is super cheap at ~$10 for a bowl, though they do not come with eggs ($2 extra per egg). The food also comes out mega fast.

+ Wonderful service: The female server here is phenomenal at her job - I've only been here 2-3 times and she remembered all my food allergies and is just extremely friendly and absolutely exceptional at her job. I love coming here in equal parts because of the food and to catch up with a friendly face.

+ Nice atmosphere: ambiance is cute inside and out - it's located on a beautiful block on Hereford Street between Comm Ave & Newbury - charming airs all around!"
27,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,9/9/2021,"They change their noodle... Unless they served differently from California shops. 

Nonetheless, it's still good soup. 

It's very much like the one in California.  The wait wasn't too bad, probably about 30 minutes."
28,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,7/18/2021,"We were having a late lunch and my companion suggested Santouka. What a wonderful decision! The outdoor seating is lovely, service is prompt and the ramen -- sooo delicious! I ordered the shoyu ramen and BE ordered the miso ramen. It came promptly and we devoured it just as fast.

30,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,1/22/2022,"I ordered the Chashu Miso Ramen, and it was really flavorful! The broth was a bit saltier than I expected, but it's pretty typical of ramen broth to be salty in order to make the noodles flavorful. I also ordered an additional egg, but I was a little disappointed because the egg was not as runny :( however, the flavor of the ramen was amazing and it's definitely worth the visit!!"
31,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,8/17/2021,"Santouka is my long-time favorite ramen place. It's just SO. Good. I always get the karamiso ramen and it NEVER disappoints. The chashu is melt in your mouth, the noodles are done to perfection, and the broth is a perfect spicy. I especially like this location because it is so small and feels so personal and lively (at least, pre-covid smallness was a benefit to me!). Service is always friendly and I always leave my bowl clean."
32,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/19/2022,"BEST RAMEN I HAVE EVER HAD. 

The only thing that some may not like about Santouka is that you may have to share a table with strangers depending on how busy they are. It's a very small restaurant. Not a problem for me personally but it definitely could change some peoples minds. 

If you like ramen, you HAVE to go!"
33,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,11/12/2020,"With covid their capacity has shrunk even more than their previously small location provided them. They were able to get a few tables set up outside but with the cold weather I don't know how much longer they will be able to use those. Despite all this, I was seated relatively quickly, maybe in 10 minutes and the line I saw went by decently quick as well. 

The food came out very quick as well. This is only if my go to ramen places because it is so delicious. The broth isn't too salty and you get a very good proportion of noodles to toppings to broth. I got the Kara ramen I believe. I wish it was a little spicer but it was still overall great. This is one of my go to ramen spots for sure."
34,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,12/31/2021,"I had the ramen a while back when visiting Boston. Tbh, the ramen was not delicious and the soup is pretty bland even though I asked for saltier soup base. The restaurang is small and a bit clustered, but most ramen places are like that. Fast and friendly service is the only plus."
35,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,6/9/2021,"Came here on Monday evening! We arrived at around 6:30, and was seated immediately. About 30 minutes later, the whole restaurant was packed inside and out!

The menu was brief but that just hints how perfect each bowl of ramen must be! We ordered 2 Shio Ramen, which came out in a timely manner. I added an egg to mine as well! I love trying out ramen soups before digging into my meal and this soup was delicious! It was such a flavorful broth but its not thick at all! The pork was cooked perfectly, super soft and melty as well. Theres the perfect amount of noodles in each bowl as well! 

Overall, it's been so long since I've been to Santouka and i'm glad to say the quality is still there! Many restaurants weren't able to maintain their quality after the pandemic hit but Santouka definitely kept theirs!"
36,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,7/7/2021,Last time I been here was pre covid and they've expanded their seating to have outdoor seating also. We had a group of 4 and fit perfectly at one of their outdoor tables. Might be a little tough to sit outside if you have a larger group. The ramen was great at a good price too! The small size is just enough to fill me up without feeling too heavy afterwards. But if you want some extra broth and noodles the large size will satisfy you
37,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,11/4/2021,"A Boston comfort ramen joint with fresh well prepared ramen noodles, rice and char su. Tight packed spaces during COVID and TQ non-autonomous staff.  Not much spice, and no hot tea is easier to clean, but questionable authenticity.  I understand the business reasons but not the lack of spacing."
38,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,10/15/2021,"Solid ramen joint in back bay.  Highly recommend for the taste and quality.  Combo meal is a good deal and will leave you full. Natto tastes ok they could tell me it's not the frozen garbage most places serve and I would believe them (I didn't ask).  Pretty consistent in taste but the garnish can be off depending who is working. 

They are very quick as they should be since it's a ramen joint. Speed should be a given. I am typically in and out under 20 mins. 

Points off for small things like small size of the place. Seriously don't go with groups larger than two or you will wait. They have two large tables that can accommodate six or so people. That's it. 

The rookies won't notice but their shio ramen is actually tonkotsu ramen and not shio. Not many places can do shio so not shocked but don't order it thinking it's shio ramen."
39,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,10/29/2021,My favorite ramen spot!! The broth is very comforting -- very hot and flavorful! The ramen is al dente and pairs very well with the broth. The broth is pork I believe. So delicious! It is always consistent. Love their signature and spicy ramen here! Must try!
40,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"Place was fairly packed for Sunday lunch; get here early if you have a large group. Service was extremely quick considering the lunch rush.

We got the Cha Shu Ramen (Shio); 1 medium and 1 large. Honestly the medium is a filling portion because the broth will fill you up quick. For another $1 you can get the large if you want more noodles and broth. 

The Shio broth is really something - smooth, rich, and complex pork flavor. I'm convinced that Santouka has the best broth in town (or possibly in the state). Because the broth is made in-house and this place is a Japanese chain it's truly the real deal.

Go for the Cha Shu Ramen if you want more than 2 pieces of pork. The 5 pieces that they give you are sizeable and don't have too much fat so it's quite the steal."
41,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,10/16/2021,"Rating: 4.5 stars (rounded up)

The food is very good and SO reasonably priced. ~$11 for ramen is excellent, and the ramen is absolutely phenomenal- so flavorful, rich, and the meat so tender and delicious! Just FYI that just about everything including an egg costs extra ($2 for egg). The restaurant is truly tiny and as a result I wouldn't recommend coming here with a group- I came as part of a group of 4 and we unfortunately had to sit at the bar counter area :(. There are probably ~15 seats in the entire restaurant. For this reason, there is almost always a queue; we waited 45 minutes on Thursday 6pm. You will get rushed out when your party begins to finish eating as well, which is a little uncomfortable. Drink menu is limited, with no alcohol, though they do have Calpico! This overall is a good and authentic experience but best in certain settings- probably solo or as a couple, and would try for off peak times, and don't expect to be able to get a glass of wine with dinner :)."
42,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,4/28/2021,"Got Shio Ramen take out, it was carefully packed with ramen/ topping separated from the soup. I asked for ""less salt"" and it was perfectly seasoned and delicious!"
43,Santouka Back Bay,2 star rating,8/30/2021,"We are not local but were craving for ramen during dinner time. Thought this location is convenient for us so we can visit other places in Boston. The line was so long b/c the seating was limited and we waited outside on a rainy day for almost 40 min-1 hr. After we finally went in, most of items on the menu weren't available. The only thing we could get was ramen and the waitress wasn't too helpful. I have to give credits for the soup and noodles, and it tasted rich and almost similar to any decent ramen that I had in NYC. However for chashu meat, they gave us pure fats lol and I didn't eat any of them. I think there are better ramen places...so don't be fooled by the waiting line..."
44,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,10/25/2020,"Ambiance: very small location with limited seating. Very clean space for covid regulations. Clean bathroom. 

Service: quick friendly service

Food: food is ok. This place didnt make my favorite list but the ramen isnt bad. Has spicy options, vegetarian option. The pork belly was good. 

Parking: meter parking. Back bay is typically hard to find parking so it is expected."
45,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,4/13/2021,"I'm so glad we came here before the lunch rush! We ordered the spicy miso ramen, shoyu ramen, chashu don, and ajitama. The ramen was very good with flavorful (but not too heavy) broth, freshly cooked noodles that were perfectly al dente, and very tender and flavorful pork belly. The chashu don was also very good and the ajitama tasted great when we topped our ramen with it. I definitely want to come back and try more of their ramen when I'm back in the area. I know understand why this place always has a line!"
46,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/10/2022,"Love the Santouka restaurants, huge fan of the Negi ramen as it's spicy enough and flavorful. Always ask for the double pork. Servers were quick, attentive, and friendly. The only possible downside I could think about was the size of the restaurant. If you go and it happens to be busy, especially in the winter, you could find yourself waiting outside for a good chunk of time. We luckily weren't one of those people, but we did watch some of them wait in the frigid winter. Either way, definitely worth the wait but bring some gloves!"
47,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,7/8/2020,"Wow, normally this place is packed and can never get a seat but we just happened to walk by and it was open. They were very safe about Covid-19 practices by making  us use hand sanitizers before we walked in. There were temporary walls between each seating area. 

The food is cheap for the city - got a combo with a small Shoyu ramen, with chasu shohan (fried rice and pork belly). I love that there was options for small bowl; most places have oversized overpriced bowls. The flavor was perfectly salty and the egg was perfectly cooked! Great service!"
48,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,3/14/2021,"This location may be small but they pack a punch of flavor in their ramen dishes! Definitely a fan favorite so expect a wait before you can try their delicious meal! The broth will satisfy your tastebuds and warm up your tummy on a cold winter day. I usually order the Shoyu Ramen with a side of corn and a soft boiled egg.

The staff here is very attentive and super friendly in their service. Always had a great experience whenever I stop by with friends."
49,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,6/15/2021,Delicious food and fast delivery. Great packaging that kept the soup and noodles fresh. Would definitely order from again and can't wait to visit in person.
50,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,6/16/2020,"I came here a handful of times pre-COVID and always left satisfied, although there was ALWAYS a line outside and it took a while to be seated. That just speaks to the popularity of this place and how good the food is. Also the interior is small so they can only seat so many people at a time.

I hadn't eaten here in a while, and I had a craving for it. They are open for take-out and delivery right now, so I decided to order my usual karamiso ramen. I ordered for pick-up on Grubhub at around 7pm and my food was ready 5 minutes later! No more long wait times, yay!!!

The to-go packaging is very well thought out. The noodles, meat, etc are all separated from the broth so it doesn't get soggy during transport, and the container is inside a plastic bag in case of spills. The container is big enough to use as a bowl; just add the ingredients into the broth and mix together to loosen up the noodles!

Pre-COVID, I would get the $15 combo, which allowed me to add corn and butter + ajitama to my karamiso ramen. I didn't see the option to make it a combo when ordering online so I guess they're not offering it currently. I had some corn and butter at home so I just made my own, but ajitama is a little more complicated to make. You can add it to your order but I wasn't willing to spend extra money on it.

Another thing I noticed was that the menu items got a little pricier. I'm not sure if this happened before COVID or during, but my ramen (not the $15 combo, just ramen alone!) cost $14.75 pre-tax. Before, a karamiso ramen alone was $11.75 pre-tax. I'm assuming the price increase is to account for the lack of tips since there's no dine-in allowed.

I wish the karamiso ramen came with more meat... like even 1 more slice would have been so much better. It only comes with 2 slices so my meat:noodle ratio is always off. But other than that, the flavor is so strong and so good. Even as a to-go order when it's not fresh out of the kitchen, it hits the spot. The karamiso broth isn't overly spicy in my opinion but has a nice kick to it. The noodles are chewy and delicious. The meat basically melts in your mouth.

Overall, I highly recommend this place, ESPECIALLY right now when the food is ready in less than 10 minutes. I'm sure once they're fully open for dine-in this will no longer happen, so take advantage of it while you can."
51,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,12/26/2020,"Very solid and reliable ramen in Boston. The location has very limited seating. If you have 4 or more, I'd suggest going early or go to their sister location in Cambridge. The back bay location had only 3 tables who sat 2 each and a bar top which sat about 6 max.

Service was good. Food was excellent. I'd recommend getting the combo deals. Starts at $15 and you get a bowl of ramen, a side dish, and an egg! This time I got the spicy miso, which is a good mild spice, with chashu gohan side, and the egg. I only got the chashu gohan because you get extra bits of chashu that I can eat with my ramen. My fiancee got the regular ramen with 2 eggs! By the time we finished, a line outside the restaurant was forming. Overall very delicious ramen at an even more delicious price!"
52,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,6/24/2021,Small and well-staffed. Menu is available by scan and strangers may be seated next to you at the same table. The food was really good and service was efficient. Get there early because they don't take reservations.
53,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,3/31/2021,"This is hands down probably one of the best ramen places I've had in my life. Been here multiple times (including the one in Harvard) and I've always just been blown away. Only downside is that there is ALWAYS a wait, especially in the back bay location and they require you to line up. Atleast the Harvard spot lets you leave a phone number. 

Regardless, the quality of the ramen is absolutely superb. The noodles are cooked to perfection and it carries the flavor of the broth extremely well. The broth itself isn't overly heavy or salty. It's perfectly balanced, as all things should be. The charsu is soft and savory, the Bamboo is crunchy yet not tough, the ear fungus give diversity to texture.

Also get the charshu rice. It's very simple but pair it with the sauces and it's an absolute pleasure. 

I can't compliment this place enough, I really really love it. Service is also always great!!"
54,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,12/19/2021,"there's a reason why this place always has such long lines no matter how hot or cold it is outside. partially it's because the inside of the restaurant can probably only fit 20 customers at once, but it's also because the ramen is amazing!
-they don't accept reservations. the lines are really long during lunch/dinner hours; we had to wait around 45 minutes for a table of 4. however, the service is really quick. because they have so many customers, the food is made very quickly; we only had to wait less than 10 minutes for our food after ordering. although, you're kind of pressured to leave the restaurant once you finish your food. we didn't mind though, because they have to move the line along one way or another. 
-i don't remember if they accept both cash and card, but i believe we paid for our food with cash.
-if you want to order takeout/pickup, you can do so through their website.

-tonkotsu shio ramen: this is one of their most popular bowls; it has a silky tonkotsu broth enhanced with a simple salt flavor. the default toppings are pork chasu, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and a small piece of narutomaki. if you want any additional toppings, like more pork or an egg, it'll cost extra. however, i just went with the standard option. you can get the bowl in small, medium, or large sizes, which are all different prices. i decided to get the medium bowl, which costs $12.57 including tax. although the bowl looks initially kind of small, it's actually quite filling, the toppings tasted great together, and the pork was tender and cooked just the right amount the broth was rich and super flavorful, and the ramen noodles soaked up the broth really well. it also wasn't too salty, but it did make me feel quite thirsty after eating. otherwise, i really couldn't find anything that i disliked about this bowl, and it was reasonably priced too! (4.5/5)

overall, the ramen is seriously is great. it's not anything super special or on the same level as ramen from japan, but it's one of the best options in boston. not to mention, the affordability makes the meal even more worth it. while i can't imagine myself coming back anytime soon since their lines are so long, i really did enjoy my experience here. i'd highly recommend that you must try their tonkotsu shio ramen!"

57,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,12/31/2021,Awesome as always. This combo is super filling. My only complaint is that the wait is too long esp in this weather
58,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,9/12/2021,My friends came over from Florida. I was really excited wanted them to try this place. But we were kind of disappointed with the broth. My order was not very flavorful at all
59,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,5/3/2021,"I always wanted to try this location for long time and finally after getting Covid Vaccine Me and my wife had extra time to have ramen brunch there.
We ordered Mazemen, Kara Rammen, and Natto Gohan.
Maybe we had too much expectation but all of them were just average, or less. Mazemen was super salty and the noodles were little uncooked. Kara Ramen was the best among three dishes we had but it was too salty as well. Natto Gohan (Rice with fermented beans) is nothing write home about. It was just white rice with natto with just some scallion."
60,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,2/21/2022,"This is one of my favorite ramen places in Boston. Although there is often a line and a wait, it is well worth it. There are three different sizes you can get, however, the regular was plenty in my opinion. The Kara Miso Ramen is definitely my favorite. The broth is perfect and did not taste too salty. I love the marinated egg that you can add! Sometimes when it is very busy, you might have to share a table with another party but I truly believe this is all part of the experience and I love that! The restaurant is small but quality over quantity is important. Their ramen is PERFECT for a cold day but also very satisfying for a warmer day too."
61,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,7/19/2021,"My girlfriend and I went for lunch on a Monday and were luckily able to sit down immediately (this place is normally packed with a line stretching down the block). They have ~5 tables outside on the street and more seating inside. We elected to sit outside. I think they also do a lot of takeout business.  

I got the Kara Miso Ramen, which was fantastic. I believe this was the second spiciest option on the menu, behind the Negi Namben Ramen. Also very good from a price standpoint compared to other restaurants in Boston and Back Bay in particular. 

Only wrinkle was that their credit card system was down when we went. We had cash so wasn't a problem but otherwise they were writing down credit card numbers. 

Overall, would highly recommend."
62,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,2/4/2021,"I got the Vegetarian ramen and it jus didn't have any depth of flavor. You may ask why get a vegetarian ramen at a ramen shop? I ask why have it on the menu if it's going to lack any flavor? Thankfully I had asked for chili oil and that added some flavor to it. 

The noodles were also mediocre. Nothing special. 

My packet of nongshim shin ramen black has more flavor in it for 1/6 of the price"
63,Santouka Back Bay,2 star rating,2/6/2021,"Santouka Back Bay attracts massive lines and widespread adulation for their flavorful ramen bowls, but they definitely have less to offer for plant-based visitors. Their vegetarian ramen was bland, salty, and oily, leaving much to be desired. I hoped for more tofu, vegetables, and real flavor, but the experience really disappointed. Overall, Santouka wins points for their small-shop ambiance, great location, and passion for the perfection of a precise craft, but Red White (nearby on Newbury) will provide a much tastier experience for vegetarian ramen enthusiasts."
64,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,1/14/2021,Waited an hour in rain and snow due to 4 person at a time capacity because of COVID. Pretty good soup ramen and soup base. But i like their butter corns. Ordered two of those along with the spicy miso with extra spicy

67,Santouka Back Bay,1 star rating,12/27/2020,"Christmas letdown

It was a rainy Christmas Day this year. It was 2:25pm and had been raining all day on the 25th. It was hard deciding what to eat with most restaurants closing for Christmas Day. Luckily I find Santouka back bay open. Without hesitation, I called at 2:30pm to make sure I wasn't dreaming. 

""Hey are you guys really open today?"" 

The host curtly answers, ""yes.""

""I know there is usually a line out the door. Is that the case today? What's the volume like?""

The host answers, ""no, when are you coming? And for how many?"" 

""I roughly estimate 15 minutes for two?""

The host answers, ""should be fine"" 

""Perfect. We will be there soon. Thanks"" 

As soon as I hang up, my girlfriend and I grab our umbrellas and immediately start walking over at 2:30pm. She mentions that she saw a closing time of 3pm online today, so we acknowledge it and briskly start walking to the restaurant. Because of the rain, wind and puddles, it was a long 15 minutes, and we ended up at the front of the restaurant at 2:52pm. 22 minutes. 

The host sees us struggling to open the door against the wind and just watches us. As soon as we open the door, he quietly points towards the sign saying they are closed at 3pm today. Cool. So we're just in time! 

NOPE. Last call was 2:45pm and we won't be seated. I tried appealing to him that it's Christmas Day, we walked in the rain for over 15 minutes to get here, there's a table clearly empty for us, no one else is outside except us so its not a big deal to make a one time exception. Nope. He did not give a damn. He could've told us, if we called at 2:30pm saying we'll be there by 2:45pm, that they are taking last call at 2:45. 

It is what it is. He probably wants to get off work on Christmas Day as early as possible. It was disappointing that he wouldn't mention last call or closing up shop when it was THAT close to the deadline. 

To my dear readers who may think this review comes off harsh, please think back on any time that you asked for operating hours of a restaurant over the phone: was it not customary for the host to tell you the last call for kitchen/bar should it differ from a published closing time? If I called the restaurant at 2:30 with an eta of 15 mins, should that not have warranted some kind of disclosure from the host's part? The behavior of that host was frustrating and, frankly, negligent.

I am leaving a one star review not because of this one incident but after numerous instances where the same host has manifested zero hospitality. I honestly love the food so I keep going back but the host leaves too much to be desired for a higher review."
68,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,10/21/2021,"The line for this place was long when we arrived because the inside of this place is small, but it went quickly and the food was worth the wait. The service is quick and the ramen was delicious. I ordered the char siu ramen!"
69,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/16/2022,"Their takeout is amazing. In my opinion it's the best tasting ramen in Back Bay/Fenway, and a great value too. I personally don't like waiting in line for a table, but they are good at predicting when their takeout orders will be ready and I'm always surprised by how fast their kitchen is."
70,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,8/22/2019,"Santouka Back Bay had a long line when we initially passed by so we decided to come back the following day for dinner.

We arrived at around 5 pm and there was
already a line about 7 people ahead of us. We waited about 10 minutes and then we were seated. 

The restaurant is very small. Probably seats max 20 people. 

We ordered the Combo Shoyu Ramen with variations of added ingredients (such as egg, corn or pork with rice in side). 

Shortly later, our ramen came piping hot and steaming to our table. The broth and noodles were rich and tasty and there was a good amount of pork included. 

We were looking for a good place in Boston for our Ramen fix and found one!

Tip:  As the line gets very long to get in try and get there before the open for a reduced wait."
71,Santouka Back Bay,2 star rating,2/8/2021,"I have been an avid visitor of this location, eating lunch here at least once-twice a week in the summer until November, but I stopped going because of the terrible service..
The host and the other staff are so rude to customers!! My partner and I are both international and our first language is not English, therefore, sometimes it's hard to understand English from hearing. My partner was asking a host for a seat outside because inside they are really shoddy on following the regulations. The host said something and my partner couldn't hear it properly because of the language barrier, the host had an audacity to roll his eyes, point to the table and slap the glasses of water on a shaky table after.
I am not coming back, ever."
72,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,1/4/2021,"Very small eatery, good food and service. I will order online via their original website and pick up next time to avoid queuing up"
73,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,8/19/2019,"I heard this was the place to go in Boston--had to check it out. I got the $15 combo with kara miso. 

BROTH: So flavorful but not too rich. I personally prefer a slightly richer broth, but the flavors here are impeccable. The spicy miso broth wasn't spicy for someone like me who has a higher tolerance, but it packs a nice kick that still makes the broth enjoyable to consume. In comparison, the stranger who sat next to me was coughing in response to the spicy broth. So maybe not the choice for those with a low tolerance. 

NOODLES: I'm a fan of al dente noodles. These still held a slightly chewy texture, but were a touch on the softer side. The portion isn't too heavy either for the regular size. You leave feeling satisfied, not too full. 

LINE: I got there around 1:15pm on a Sunday and waited around 20-25 minutes for one seat. Not bad at all, but I don't think I'd ever find myself waiting for an hour here like I would elsewhere.  

SERVICE: I was in and out faster than my wait time for a seat. To maximize efficiency/turnover rates, you're seated across/next to people in other parties. The fewer people in your party, the easier is will be to seat you at these communal tables. Because I was a party of one, it made sense that I sat down, ordered, and was served all under 10 minutes. Staff was efficient, good at scanning tables, but all in the name of quick turnover. If you're looking for a calm sit down meal where you don't feel pressured to eat fast, this place isn't it. Take your conversation elsewhere. 

Overall, I've had better ramen. But this place puts up a good fight. I'd consider coming back if I'm in the area, but only if the line isn't too long."
74,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,12/3/2019,"Yu um!!! We went here on a Wednesday evening at 5pm and waited about 10-15ish minutes. Not bad! Way less than I expected. 

Their service is speedy! which makes sense since they always have a huge line outside their door. We received our food shortly after we ordered. I got the kara miso ramen combo with corn. DELICIOUS! The perfect amount of spice and food. The noodles and broth were perfect and the corn was so good. I love the butter that they pair with it. 

It's definitely worth the wait and it's quite inexpensive!"
75,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,12/1/2019,"Solid ramen shop in the city. Having read the reviews and it being Thanksgiving weekend, our table of 3 arrived a few minutes after opening on a Sunday and was second in line. Our total wait time was 30min however due to the venue only seating ~18. 

Food: The regular size filled me up. If you're hungry, I'd recommend a large. The price was on par with the bowl size. We got miso and shoyu ramen. Both very rich in flavor. Noods good. Pork belly was so-so. 

Service: Quick. We were able to order in line and have our ramen ready when we got seated! 

I wouldn't say it was worth the wait in the WINTER bc we were freezing in the cold. So just get to the restaurant a little before it opens!"
76,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,12/19/2020,"My go-to place for ramen! Perfect for a cold winter day. I was seated at the bar and they had plastic dividers for COVID (reminded me a bit of eating ramen in single booths in Japan). The $15 combo is a steal -- I love their chashu gohan, and ajitama is a must. I got the karamiso ramen this time and it was only mildly spicy, which was perfect for me. The service was nice as well, and overall it was a great experience!"
77,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,5/16/2020,"After 3 years of living in Back Bay and having Santouka always be my go-to hang-over cure. I've decided its time to give them a solid review, after all the unknowing times they were there for me.

True to their motto, their ramen soup really does provide: the essence of simplicity and deep umami flavors.

I always order:
-the signature tonkotsu shio ramen
-cha-shu gohan rice bowl

The cha-shu rice is bomb! Japanese rice with perfectly salted cha-shu chunks. The cha-shu is fresh and not fatty/greasy. The green onions make for the perfect compliment. Who knew such a simple dish could be so satisfyingly good?!

I one time ordered to-go and my initial thought was *wow, impressive, well-thought of to-go packing for ramen. Usually, Asian to-go order noodle soups come with noodles and soup in 2 separate styrofoam containers. Santouka has their noodles and toppings placed neatly divided & stacked on top of the soup! Just, a detail appreciation! As far as flavor goes, the soup has so much depth. I could drink it all the time. The noodles are a bit hard and could use some work. The cost is also moderately overpriced for the portion, but I get it Back Bay rent ain't cheap!"

Loved it here and will be back."
79,Santouka Back Bay,2 star rating,7/16/2021,"It seems like their karamiso does not contain Tonkotsu soup, and is not specified by any description. I tried their gomamiso soup which does coagulate after refrigerated. So their Tonkotsu soup is not fake."
80,Santouka Back Bay,1 star rating,10/2/2021,"Rude wait staff. I asked if I could sit outside, when there were 4-5 empty tables, and the response was ""no.""

Then he told me to stand in the line (there was no one in line).

Also the space is extremely small with everyone basically sitting elbow to elbow with no ventilation. Your stereotypical COVID trap.

Why anyone would want to pay money to this place and get treated like trash + contract COVID is beyond me."
81,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,8/21/2021,"Delicious broth and cozy vibes. I once waited in pouring rain with friends thinking it wouldn't be as busy, but others must have been thinking the same and there was still a decent line outside the door. Worth tho"
82,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,4/15/2019,"Now listen, no one wants to wait in line to eat but at the same time, when you see a line for a restaurant you know it's probably worth the wait. Needless to say, if you decide to visit this location you will definitely be waiting in line to get your bowl of ramen. The restaurant itself is pretty small so be prepared to eat your dinner in a very close proximity to strangers. 

As a ramen connoisseur I can tell you that this ramen was definitely worth the wait. I ordered the miso ramen combo which was $15 and came with a side of corn and butter and a tea egg. The noodles were thinner than some of the other ramen places I have been to, but they tasted fresh and firm,but not too firm . The tea egg was also just the right amount of soft and complimented the rest of the dish. 

Overall you will leave with a full belly and a happy heart. It's definitely worth the wait."
83,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,3/29/2019,"I think I'm a little spoiled coming from the SF Bay Area where ramen is abundant and amazing. This is the first ramen place in Boston I've had and it just didn't impress me. 

The price is a little high. It's a filling size, but don't expect to have leftovers if you get the regular size. 

I ordered the Char Siu Ramen with Miso broth, which gives a substantial amount of pork. The noodles have a nice chew to them, but the broth was too thick and salty. It's just not really drinkable which is unfortunate. 

There's not much seating inside, so if you don't come before 5, expect to wait a little while (we waited ~15 minutes). Overall, I won't be coming back unless a friend wants to try."
84,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,3/27/2019,"You know you're in for a treat if there's a line outside . . . IN FEBRUARY, IN BOSTON. I'll be honest - I hesitated waiting in line. It was so cold and I'm from Miami which means I don't have thick skin or any cold tolerance whatsoever.

The result - it was so good! I'm glad we waited. I'm sure the line would have been much worse had we gotten there earlier. I believe most of the broths are tonkotsu-based but there is a veggie option. I chose the Negi Namban Ramen with a side of an egg and corn. So much flavor and on such a cold evening, my belly was so happy. There were a lot more onions that I anticipated but that's on me for not fully reading the menu.

The restaurant is very small. It only fits about 18 people but the food comes out fairly quick so the tables turn quick. Do not expect to ""eat alone"". You will be sat next to your fellow diners but don't fret, make friends! You're all there to enjoy a nice, warm bowl of soup! I can't wait to go back . . . not in the winter, lol."
85,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,6/2/2019,"One of my favorite ramen shops in Boston!

This place is tiny though - ended up waiting over 45 minutes to be seated for a party of two. However, I think that it is well worth the wait to try for the first time. Their shio ramen is here is just so good - the broth is quite pork-y and has a great consistency and the pork here is the perfect mix of fatty and lean. Super tender. I highly recommend!"
86,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/19/2020,"RAMEN SOLO

I feel like a ramen Jedi because I used the force in my favor. This place is packed. I walked by on a Friday night and there were 40 people in line. I checked out the menu and I knew I had to eat here. It was now Saturday night and again there were 40 people in line at 6:30pm. It didn't help that it was January and it was a high of 68, in fact it probably made the line even longer. 

The best part of traveling for work is dining solo and sometimes it has its advantages. While I was in the back of the line the server was looking for just one person and I was the lucky solo that literally got to skip the line. Honestly I was only in line for about 5 minutes. This was my lucky day to Ramen. 

The menu is not very friendly on line and it's inconsistent because there locations can have different items. They have a great $15 deal where you pick 3 items. I decided to go for it. I wanted to go spicy and decided to order the spicy miso ramen, Cha-Shu Gohan which is Pork and Rice and Aji Tama which is a soft boiled egg marinated in soy-based sauce. The egg was cooked perfectly. The broth for the ramen was crazy good. The menu says the broth takes 18 hours to make from beef bones. The Cha-Shu Gohan was really good. I added spicy broth to it and took it back to my hotel for breakfast. I'm a lucky man. 

The restaurant is tiny. It literally has 18 seats located at 2 tables and 1 bar that faces the kitchen. I was seated at a table of complete strangers. I honestly felt like I was traveling around the world by sharing a community table. Those people finished and I was introduced to a whole new group that joined me. Yes a party of 5 joined me at my table. As I enjoyed my ramen I listened to the girl next to me talk about her upcoming wedding. She shared the planing, the church, the dress and much more. I wanted to jump in but kept focusing on my ramen. The cutest part was when I went to leave she told me to have a nice night. That was really sweet considering we ate dinner together but never had a conversation with each other. I felt a little bad but it's best I kept quite because they would have never got me to stop talking. 

It is worth the wait. They really serve fast and keep the line moving. My waiter was really nice. I've read review that the servers are mean. I have to disagree with this. Hey have a job to do and that is to move people in and out. There was a group of four that had paid their bill and were still hanging out. The waiter politely asked them to leave. He did it in a nice manner but I'm sure someone in the group will write a bad review because the lu felt rushed. I could see that my waiter hates having to do this but it's the only way he can get diners in. My advice is to know what you want, eat your food, pay your bill and get out. It's your duty to help your fellow ramen lover waiting in line. I was lucky enough to have to force in my side and I hope you have the same luck that I did when you dine"
87,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,6/26/2019,"TLDR: small space, great ramen. 

Always a line the inside fits around 25 at most. Don't come here if you've got a group bigger than 4.  Anyways, ramen is super solid. It's a tonkotsu broth so pork based. They do have a veggie broth as well as long as supplies last. Broth is great, the chashu wonderful and all around a great bowl of ramen. Be prepared to wait 15 minutes when you get here, but it's definitely good."
88,Santouka Back Bay,1 star rating,12/11/2021,"Gave a ten percent tip and the busk boy asked to fight and cursed me out. He then proceeded to tell the waiter who helped me that I didn't pay even though he swiped my card, when I started to say if he needed the money I can put down more and then proceeded to say he didn't want my money and he never wanted me back inside of the restaurant."
89,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,6/11/2019,"I had no idea that a Santouka opened up here! I haven't walked past this street in what it seems to be a VERY long time to notice that it's no longer an Indian Cuisine place.

I was starving and was actually on the hunt for some soup and when I spotted here I came in. It's very small inside so minimal seating. But I came outside of peak hours so it was pretty empty. They have all the ramen bowls as the one in Harvard but not as many side items. 

Items NOT on the menu here that I noticed:
- takoyaki
- Karaage
- Gyoza
- Green Salad
- Shiyake Ikura Gohan

I was served very quickly. The staff is very attentive. I took up the menu from the chair next to me while I had my Cha-Shu Ramen to see if there was anything I could order for my husband to take out (which by the way the do not do) and the waiter was attentive to ask if I was ok and needed anything else."
0,Krasi,5 star rating,3/28/2022,"I had an incredible experience at Krasi and think that this may be my new favorite restaurant in Boston. Everything was perfect.

FOOD
Each dish was perfect. My friend and I shared the following:
* Taramosalata
* Pantzaria 
* Pita - changes daily; was amazing
* Giouvetsi - this lamb osso buco + orzo combo was amazing
* Halva ice cream + chocolate cake - so good

DRANK
Greek white wines are delicious! I had a glass of Malagousia. It was fruity and went well with all the food. They also have the Xynisteri from Tsiakkas, which I've tried before and love - I highly recommend that, too!

VIBE
The vibe is chic, intimate, clean, and modern. Located right off of Newbury street, which is also great to explore. 

SERVICE
The service was outstanding! Everyone was so nice, helpful, and extremely quick. 

MONEY THO
Not bad at all! My friend and I had 5 dishes + 1 glass of wine each, and we paid less than $70/person. Great value."
1,Krasi,4 star rating,4/11/2022,"I came here for brunch on a Saturday with my friend. We originally got bar seating, but the hostess was able to get us a seat at the table which was much appreciated! The ambience of this place was very elegant with the thoughtfully selected Greek-inspired decor. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great suggestions. We ordered 3 dishes, which were just the right amount for the 2 of us, and they came fairly quickly after we ordered. Here's what we got, ranked from favorite to least favorite:

Solomo ($16)
The smoked salmon was delicious and paired well with all the other ingredients. It was well balanced with the acidity from the caper berries to the richness of the boiled egg and cream cheese.

Souvla
Delicious cuts of lamb that was extremely tender and flavorful. The char on the outside gave each piece a nice smoky flavor.

Pita with Fried Egg ($12 + $2 for egg)
The pie was good, but it wasn't as flavorful as the other dishes.

Besides the food, we also got 2 drinks: Aphrodite's Bellini ($12) and Greek Negroni ($16). They were both tasty. I recommend the Bellini if you prefer a sweeter drink."
2,Krasi,5 star rating,3/26/2022,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday with my fiancé. Place was really nice and tables felt roomy when sitting down. The waiter was super nice and gave us a ton of suggestions, most of which we ended up taking. The best part was the food. 

First thing we had were the Dips. Bread was top notch, and the spicy feta was unique. Next we were brought the Solomo. The lox was delicious, definitely recommend. We also had the Pita and the Avga Me Patates. My favorite out of everything though was the Orange Cake. Please don't skimp out on the Orange Cake, trust me it's worth coming here just for that."
3,Krasi,5 star rating,4/9/2022,"The atmosphere of this place is so cute. Very good for weekend brunch. The coffee was good, nothing special. You must get the tsoureki. It was almost like a breakfast apple pie with this delicious granola and a very mild chocolate sauce. Incredible. 2nd favorite dish was the avga me patates. We got without goat cheese but it was really good. The  bougatsa was good but nothing special. The pancakes had an interesting filling I wasn't a fan of personally. It was a crumbly whey like texture. Service was excellent! Food came super fast."
4,Krasi,5 star rating,1/9/2022,"We came here as a last night of vacation dinner and I'm still thinking about it. I haven't been able to find a Greek restaurant like this anywhere near me and it's so upsetting. This was such a great restaurant to have ended our time in Boston!
We ended up getting a few different things to share and every bit was so delicious so I can only imagine how great the whole menu is. We also got some wonderful greek wines that we plan to purchase to have at home. 
I really loved the vibes of this restaurant and how trendy, but cozy it was inside. I also loved how the menu was traditional Greek foods. It really felt like we were getting what we would find in Greece. The employees were all so knowledgeable about the menu and we had great service. 
I recommend this place to anyone I know visiting Boston and we would definitely come back!"
5,Krasi,5 star rating,1/1/2022,"My friend and I came here for dinner and the food was PHENOMENAL. I would say it was in the top five best meals either of us have ever had. 

We started with the Tiropita Rolls and the Htipiti dip. The bread itself was probably the best bread I've ever had. It was perfectly warm, moist, and delicious. I could've eaten the rolls all night. The whipped feta had so much flavor and had a little kick to it. It paired so well with the veggies we ordered on the side. 

Our favorite thing we ordered was the Papoutsakia - it was so flavorful and creamy. We also got the Patates and Pantzaria. 

Our server was incredible - we unfortunately didn't catch her name, but she was so helpful in guiding us through the menu and the wine list. She gave us a little wine tasting based on a little information on which wines we prefer, and picked the most delicious wines for both of us. Overall, incredible service and incredible food. We cant wait to come back here!"
6,Krasi,5 star rating,1/6/2022,"I had a great experience dining here at Krasi! We were seated quickly, the service was attentive without being overbearing, and the food was unique and tasty.

We ordered 4 dishes to share between 2 people, which was more than enough food! My favorite item by far was the Taramosalata dip. The tarama was light, creamy, and flavorful. The monkfish was also delicious.

They also have an extensive wine list that was a bit too long for me to make a decision on my own. Our server was very helpful with this! After asking for our wine preferences, she brought over two wines for us to taste before we made our selection. Any restaurant that provides a tasting before making a selection on beer/wine is highly ranked in my book!

I was able to book a table for a late (8:45pm) dinner 1 week in advance, so I would definitely look into reservations earlier if you have a bigger group or want a specific dining time. 

Overall, this is a great spot for a dinner date or simply a delicious meal with friends and family."
7,Krasi,5 star rating,11/26/2021,"Just about everything was delicious. Came for dinner and brunch in the same weekend. Perhaps it was because it was our first time there, but I think the brunch is better than the dinner. The dips were all great, the bread was phenomenal, the salad was incredibly tasty with so many flavors. 

For the brunch the shredded potato dish was my favorite. I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese normally, but it definitely complimented the dish, adding a bit of tartness to every bite.

For dinner, the lamb osso buco was very good, but not great. The meat itself could have been a bit more tender in my opinion. The orzo tasted tomatoey. It was all very filling. The octopus dish was confusing and unexpected. There was no indication on the menu that the octopus was ground up, so it was hard to tell there was even octopus in the dish."
8,Krasi,4 star rating,12/9/2021,"My friends and I came here for brunch on a Sunday and sat inside. The ambiance when you first enter is amazing! The bar is really lavish and the decor feels really luxurious. We had a reservation-- I'm not sure why Yelp says no reservations but they do take them! 

We saw that they had carafes of wine for $20, so naturally we had to get that. We went with white and it was more than enough for our table! 

For dishes we ordered Lalagites, Solomo, Avga me Patates, and the Pita. The dishes were smaller than we imagined unfortunately but each one tasted really good! Other than the Solomo, the dishes were a little hard to share. We ordered with the intention of sharing each dish, but I think everyone having their own plate would work better. 

Bonus point for having Aesop hand soap and hand cream in the bathrooms!!"
9,Krasi,5 star rating,11/9/2021,"Came here a few weeks ago with my husband!

Just wow. We had reserved two seats at the bar which was fun because we got to talk to our bartender/server more. The ambiance is that of a lovely, upscale wine bar and it was bustling on a Friday night.

Some must haves :

The  tiropita rolls are delectable, warm, soft, fresh, and amazing! Don't come here and pass on these, trust me. 

We also really enjoyed the htipiti which is their whipped feta dip. It has a kick and is super flavorful. We ate the dip mostly with the chicken skins which was a fun twist, but we also enjoyed the dip with some side bread. Would absolutely get this again as well.

We enjoyed the Tonos sashimi for dinner which was a plentiful portion of Mediterranean inspired sashimi. It was light, fresh, and prepared well. 

We did the short rib after which was definitely heavier and meaty-at that point we were rather full and could only have half. It was served almost like a meat lasagna which I don't think we were expecting. It was flavorful, just a little heavier than I think we were aiming for.

Nonetheless, it was all amazing and enjoyed with a wonderful bottle of wine. Our server truly was passionate about the menu and answered all of our questions eagerly. Overall, an amazing night out for date night. 

I definitely want to return for brunch and try the lamb entree based on reviews!"
10,Krasi,5 star rating,3/1/2022,"One of my all-time favorite restaurants in Boston! I went here during the summer with my friend. It was such an amazing dining experience. So I went back the second time with my boyfriend this Valentine's weekend and he also fell in love! 

We got their Solomo, Dips, Lalagites, Strapasada, and their Agva Me Patates. The Patates are perhaps their most famous brunch dish, but everything was exceptionally tasty. Our surprise favorite was actually the dips, specifically the rich and creamy taramasalata (salted cod roe). If we could order the taramasalata dip in a bucket we would!

The atmosphere is amazing. The cocktails are great! Definitely check it out!!"
11,Krasi,5 star rating,11/13/2021,"So we're standing in line for lobster rolls in ME and the couple ahead of us is from Boston and highly recommended this place. They looked like they took food seriously so we decided to give it a try. Wow, did not disappoint. We did make reservations and I would recommend it because this place looks to get pretty busy. We sat at the bar and it was perfect.

We tried the fried chicken skins with whipped feta dip. Thought it would be salty but it wasn't, the skin had a great crisp and honestly, I prob could eat this every day. We also got the grilled octopus which was super tender and beets that were delicious. Their rolls were delicious with a honey butter. What can I say when pillowy yeasty bread melts in your mouth? Besides can I have two more! We also got their grilled special of the day which was pork tenderloin. Usually I don't get tenderloin in restaurants because it's tender but lacks in flavor. Not this one, it's well seasoned and the grilling flavor comes out. The orange honey cake and ice cream was ok, might have been to satiated by the meal to fully enjoy. 

The service was awesome, our server was knowledgeable and steered us well. I would come back here in a heartbeat and try the other offerings. Or get all the same dishes again!"
12,Krasi,5 star rating,1/26/2022,"Krasi serves delicious small plates and an unique selection of Greek wines! The portions are on the bigger end for small plates, so I'd recommend going with at least 3-4 people to be able to order some more dishes across the menu! Of our meal, I enjoyed the ""Little Shoes"" eggplant and the Lamb osso bucco which had an amazingly fragrant orzo paired with it."
13,Krasi,1 star rating,2/20/2022,"The place is super nice and pretty but the food, I would, say was SO MEDIOCRE and it literally does not worth the price.

I ordered the pita and it tasted like the dough was raw and there was way too much cheese in it. I took two bites and brought the rest home.

The scrambled egg with tomato sauce was also super mediocre. It is just plain eggs plus tomato plus cheese and I left half of the plate over.

Went with great expectation but probably no second visit. Service was just okay. Manager guy is nice."
14,Krasi,5 star rating,10/17/2021,"Krasi is an excellent restaurant that serves modern takes on classic Greek cuisine. I've been for dinner and brunch and neither disappointed, but their brunch is seriously out of this world. 

I most recently went for brunch so that's what I'll be reviewing / posting. Their bougatsa was pretty good (I'm Greek and from Thessaloniki so I'm very hard to please in this department) - not too sweet but filo could be crispier. Their saganaki was insane with a jammy egg on top and a bit of spicy pepper it was probably my favourite dish. We also had the strata - an egg type pie like a quiche with loukaniko stuffed inside. Their pita was also excellent, with vegetables and cheese this was also a favourite for me. The avga me patates were a different style than I'm used to but still good with bacon served underneath. I got the Aphrodite's Bellini to drink and it was delicious. 

Overall excellent experience - I definitely recommend. Probably best brunch I've had in a long while that wasn't just over priced eggs on toast. 

Follow me on ig for more recs @ sophiaeaaats !"
15,Krasi,4 star rating,10/23/2021,"Had an excellent brunch at Krasi this morning! We originally had an outdoor reservation but it was rather cold and breezy so I reached out to switch it to indoors. They are a text only restaurant, so I was first referred to their AI messaging but when my specific question couldn't be answered, a manager texted me back. They amazingly were able to switch my reservation to inside on short notice which I really appreciated. 

We ordered several mezze dishes, most of which were amazing. The dips platter was super tasty although the ratio of dips to bread pieces felt a little off - other reviewers have mentioned you could ask for more bread but that felt tough on a busy morning. Their pita pie and peirili were really well made - I would order them again. The baklava muffin sounded good but in practice was a little dry/tough - I don't think I would get it again but it was a small sweet bite to end the meal. The coffee was truly excellent and they refilled it which I appreciated. 

All in all I would return here for brunch, and was impressed by the flexibility of reservations."
16,Krasi,5 star rating,8/16/2021,"We visited Krasi with my friend who is extremely into their food and has tried every dish on the menu. She said that Krasi is one of her favorite places for dining out. 

The options are limited on their brunch menu and we had 4 dishes to share with a group of three: Souvla, Bougatsa for 2, Pita and Lalagites. The food was great with appealing presentation especially the Lalagites which was fried pancakes, fluffy and soft inside with crispy layer. 

We also got 2 drinks, Krasi Mimosa which was specially made with Mango base and Otto Sprizitz. Both were refreshing and went perfectly with the food. 

My friend strongly recommend us to visit again for their dinner menu so we will definitely plan it when we visit Boston next time."
17,Krasi,5 star rating,8/13/2021,"Another great tapas-style spot in Boston you can't miss. Greek food, delicious wine, what's not to like!
We ordered the Salata, the daily Pita (which was stuffed with spinach and cheese), and the Skioufikta (a gnocchi-type pasta). Not only was everything delicious, where you could taste the quality of the ingredients, but also presented beautifully. We ended the night by ordering all three desserts, because we simply couldn't choose. we got the almond cookies, which came with tahini and chocolate dips, as well as some homemade orange marmalade they went so well with, and an orange-honey cake, and the chocolate salami. I've had chocolate salami from other cuisines, such as italian and portuguese, and it was very fun to taste this version, with hazelnuts in it. The last two desserts both came with ice cream which was a very good pairing."
18,Krasi,5 star rating,1/14/2022,"I came to Krasi on a whim when looking for a new restaurant to try. It was great to snag a seat at the bar at Krasi, where the menu, artwork, and vibes are decidedly and unapologetically Greek.

Jimmy was a super friendly bartender and offered recommendations. He guided me toward my entree (more on that later) and I asked for a pairing recommendation. He pointed me to one bold wine that I tasted, although I wasn't in love with it and so I tried a second. While it was lighter and a little out of the way of my typically favorite grapes, that's part of the fun. It was the Plakota from Cyprus. The wine menu is intentionally 100% Greek, and I've had fun at a few Greek restaurants learning about Greek wines. 

The tables were pretty busy on this particular Saturday night, although the bar area cleared out quickly. It smells faintly of good olive oil in the restaurant, which I take as a great sign. 

Mastija apertif was super interesting! You really have to try it, as a text description doesn't begin to capture the melange of flavors...but I'll try: Meyer lemon, freshly cut grass (in a good way), and a ton of herbs packed into a little glass!

I had the pastitsio rollo, which is made with egg pasta, braised short rib, and among other things, cinnamon. My interest was piqued by the cinnamon, but I have to say, the cinnamon was perfectly noticeable but NOT overpowering. It was really an amazing balance that I am impressed they pulled off so nicely. I followed this up with a dessert wine, courtesy of Jimmy's recommendations.

All in all, this was great! All the servers seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs and each other's company, and everyone who worked there seemed to radiate friendliness. That sounds extra, but it was true. I'm super excited to come back and get some more of Jimmy's recommendations!"
19,Krasi,5 star rating,2/7/2022,"Lovedddd this place. If you want an elegant Greek-themed date night place, def check this place out! 
**They have both vegetarian & meat options, small plates & shareables, AND everything is super appetizing & aesthetic! To top it all off, the service was warm & welcoming too, highly recommend this place if you're in the Newbury/Back Bay Area :)"
20,Krasi,5 star rating,12/7/2021,"This place was spectacular!! I was shocked how busy it gets, definitely recommend making reservations in advance especially for a big party. I had gone to celebrate a engagement and staff was very attentive and answered all our questions. We ended up doing feast for gods, which basically consisted of each plate menu other than a few items that ranged from vegetarian to meat dishes. It's definitely worth it if you have 8+ people. Dishes are family style sharing. Extremely organic and authentic food. Highly recommend. The setting is great for special dates or celebration. Adult setting not really a family setting."
21,Krasi,4 star rating,8/4/2021,"They recently introduced the brunch menu and I highly recommend for the aesthetics, taste, and service! 

Peinirli ($12): this is the egg boat looking dish that was absolutely delicious! It was super flavorful and savory, the bread/crust had the right amount of doughyness. This was my favorite thing and I would go to Krasi again just for this! The runny egg yolk also adds a nice creamyness to the dish. The metsovone cheese was absolutely amazing, providing a subtle cheese flavor that complemented the dish.

Saganaki ($14): this was a quite interesting dish because it felt very familiar and new at the same time. I liked the combination of the cheese (feta and kasseri), the egg, and the tomatoes. However, I felt like the cheese was slightly too salty for me. I've never had barley rusk but I liked that it added a crunchy texture that never became soggy! It reminded me of croutons :)

For drinks, I got the Aphrodite's Bellini and the Otto's Spritz. I personally liked the Bellini a little more because it wasn't as sweet and the spritz. I don't think that the drinks are necessarily strong but they were very delicious. 

I would definitely recommend Krasi for a nice brunch on newbury. The price point was great and I would recommend 3 dishes for 2 people to enjoy. Definitely get the drinks and the peinirli!!"
22,Krasi,4 star rating,3/15/2022,"It's a great place to meet friends for brunch or dinner. Drinks really rack up the bill here; the food is actually decently priced. 

The food is good but nothing is really memorable besides their dinner bread. Definitely not a place I'd crave but, again, good for the ambience."
23,Krasi,5 star rating,8/2/2021,"For all the places in the downtown Boston area, you would never think to find a decent new age Mediterranean spot that would blow your expectations away, but here we are! Krasi is a vibrant spot located in the Back Bay that you should definitely bookmark if you're a fan of Greek cuisine.

This place will be crowded, so book your reservation as soon as possible. Sometimes you can luck out with patio seating, but it's always good to cover your bases just in case you don't have a backup plan.

The menu is an imaginative take on traditional Greek dishes and the servings are mainly sharing plates with something for everyone, so whatever you order will be amazingly executed and satisfying. We ordered the Tzatziki Dip which was so amazing and simple, we finished the entire thing before the other dishes came out! The Tsipoura was a grilled sea bream that was not too filling. The highlight for me was their Giouvetsi (Lamb Osso Bucco). Definitely recommend ordering this if you come here. Talk about flavors that blow your mind... this is it right here.

What's even more impressive is their wine selection. If you have the appetite for it, I would suggest trying some of their selection. After all, Krasi does mean 'wine' in Greek... so why not?

A solid 5 stars all around. Thank you for your hospitality! Will definitely be back!"
24,Krasi,5 star rating,11/30/2021,"I cannot recommend Krasi enough. It is probably the best restaurant in Boston that I've been to. Everything from the ambiance to the food is so tastefully done, with impeccable service (thanks James!). Kudos for having many vegetarian and vegan options. I would list out my favorites but every single item we tried was fabulous, you can't go wrong! I especially loved how the tzatziki came out and you ""make it yourself""- it was a playful touch."
25,Krasi,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"Updating my review to 5 stars! Came back and I tried other dinner dishes and they were great - the baked chicken and pork pasta dish are incredible, as was the fried bread. I did vastly prefer the orange cake over their other desserts.

Super friendly service and more peaceful vibe when it's slower!"
26,Krasi,5 star rating,8/10/2021,"Made a reservation for dinner at Krasi. It is conveniently located between Newbury st and Boylston Street, we sat outside. The food here is served as tapas so we ordered four dishes for a party of two:
- Tableside Tzatziki 
- The octopus 
- The Artichoke 
- The Veal 

The table side Tzatziki is a lot of fun, served 4 slides of toasted and buttered bread with spices and a big bowl of Greek yogurt the waiter adds in Olive Oil with Salt and Pepper. Then gives you instructions where you can add vinegar, garlic, and dill then you can mix and eat it. The portion of the Tzatziki is huge but the flavors of the yogurt is fantastic and so fun to make. 

The octopus (xtapodi) was grilled octopus that was very tender you could cut the octopus with your fork and did not need a knife, it was not too chewy and had a wonderful grilled taste. Underneath there was this pure made of yellow split beans with a subtle sweetness of honey, it was quite delicious. On top there were micro greens which added a crispness. 

The Artichoke had a vinegary taste with baby artichokes, this little whole pearl onions, peas, sunchokes, and carrots. The flavors were quite good and they worked fairly well together but did not taste as much artichoke as I expected. 

The veal (sofrito) which was like served almost in a stew like consistency had very tender veal with veggies around it like shallots and garlic. The presentation for this dish was very home style and nothing fancy. 

Overall, the food was delicious and I will certainly be back"
27,Krasi,5 star rating,12/6/2021,"My best part of the Boston trip! Absolutely fall in love with this place. The interior was well decorated and the server at the bar table was so nice. She did give us good recommendations on food choices and the dishes were so so good! The lamb is my fav, very well seasoned but not overwhelming, the texture was tender and moist. I also loved their chocolate dessert a lot! Prolly the best dessert I've had this year. If I ever visited Boston again I will def come back to Krasi!"
28,Krasi,5 star rating,4/11/2022,An incredible experience from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. The staff and owner were warm and welcoming. The ambiance was comfortable and cool. The food and wine selection were outstanding. They made my birthday extra special. Will definitely go back whenever in Boston.
29,Krasi,4 star rating,6/7/2021,"Love the food and ambiance here! I've been wanting to try krasi because we typically frequent tapas bars and I was hoping they would have some smaller items to share. We went late on a Sunday and were able to grab bar seats immediately. 

We ordered the htipiti (whipped feta with chicken skin chips), giouvariakia (steak taretare), and the bourdeto (grouper with sauce). The steak was presented beautifully and to die for. All the food is a bit small/pricey but good and worth trying.

Service was fine and wine recs were good. We will be be back!"
30,Krasi,5 star rating,4/11/2021,"Great place with amazing food, service( Amber was our server), music, vibes... everything about this place is top notch. 
Food was delicious! We came for brunch and loved it. Portions are quite big. They added dividers between the seats so there is more safe distance per Covid. 
I highly recommend this place!"
31,Krasi,5 star rating,3/30/2022,"I have been mulling over how to express my sheer delight in regards to the dinner I had at Krasi last night. Myself and a group of 6 others came to Krasi to celebrate my 29th birthday, and we were blown away by the quality and attention the staff put into every aspect of our meal. 5/7 of us have been in the service industry for 10+ years, myself included, so we've made it a goal to seek out some of the best places in Boston and beyond. 

Truly, Krasi has moved into the top 3 restaurants for me hands down. We chose to do the feast of the gods, an option that includes everything on the menu excluding the charcuterie and cheese (though we added a few cheeses for good measure- but my gods the feast is truly a feast). 4 bottles of wine and three courses later, we had to be wheeled out in a state of euphoria. Our server Alex was phenomenal, as were the back waiters and support staff. The made us all feel attended too and special without ever being overbearing, and their attention to detail was artful. Alex came through with two amazing orange wine recommendations, and sorted through our jumbled requests for a perfect light red. I can not sing my praises enough- I will be coming back again and again because what you all do here is inspiring. From the decor and table-wear (which is BEAUTIFUL) to the desserts and the espresso- I can not recommend Krasi enough. Do yourself a favor and reserve your next night out here  thank you for a phenomenal birthday."
32,Krasi,5 star rating,3/24/2022,We walked in without a reservation but were able to grab a spot at the bar and had a fantastic meal Alexandra as our bartender/server. Great Greek wines paired perfectly with some of the best ultra-fresh food we've ever had. We will absolutely be back!
33,Krasi,5 star rating,11/8/2021,We recently had brunch at Krasi- super good food wine and cocktails. The menu reads from sweet to savory - we tried fried pancakes - savory pita with fried egg - excellent lamb special - amazing - bloody Mary's and then some vino - service great - food delicious - great start to the day! We will be back.
34,Krasi,5 star rating,9/16/2021,"Absolutely wonderful. Krasi is a well oiled machine run by knowledgeable servers and talented chefs. 

Fit with majority of small, shareable dishes, this place was perfect for a birthday dinner with friends. We split a bottle of delicious and reasonably priced wine. And ordered about 10 small plates to share amongst the group. 

Everything that came out was absolutely delicious. If you're with a bigger group, they offer a deal where you can get everything on the menu for under $400. 

Aside from the food, the restaurant is clean, inviting, and stunning.

I would come back any day."
35,Krasi,4 star rating,11/27/2021,"I've come to Krasi twice now, and both times enjoyed the experience but had some mixed feelings.

Service:
The servers are really nice and helpful. In terms if ambience, I wish that their outdoor patio were heated, as it can get quite cold having dinner at night.

Food:
Some highlights include the make your own Tzatziki sauce: it's a hit with groups and comes with some humorous instructions. The tzatziki comes with bread but could perhaps use some more bread. 

The salata is one of my favorite salads of all time - it tastes very fresh and has a good mix of textures. 

I was a little disappointed by the chicken (KOTOPOULO LEMONATO), which lacked flavor and had bones inside. 

The orange cake for dessert redeemed it though - I might come here in the future just for this cake! It is somehow infused with orange flavor and comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that pairs perfectly."
36,Krasi,5 star rating,4/19/2021,"Was able to squeeze in a last call brunch yesterday. Note that they don't seat in between brunch and dinner so ensure that you aren't going in an off hour because I did see some folks get turned away.

Was popping in just for a snack and a glass of wine but I will 100% be back for more! The dips were out of this world, so flavorful, and beautifully plated. It was accompanied with some toasted bread, a bit oily, but I loved it. Only thing I wished for was some more bread to finish off the dips with but we got the pita which went well with the leftover dip. Not sure it's totally clear but the pita is filled with cooked veggies (no meat). 

Service was great, bathrooms were clean (Aesop soup and lotion!!), atmosphere vibrant. Definitely recommend - go now!"
37,Krasi,5 star rating,2/8/2022,"Fun spot for brunch! Tapas style Greek dishes, a unique brunch experience! Sweet and savory options, as well as brunch cocktails."
38,Krasi,3 star rating,1/19/2021,"Been dying to try Krasi ever since I walked by it on my way to Select Oyster a few months ago.   Decor is trendy and romantic and it felt as if everything was by candlelight.  Pictures on the wall were of various prominent Greek figures (e.g., Pythagoras and Poseidon) in humorous poses which we thought were cool.   Service won points as well as our friendly server was professional, attentive and offered us menu suggestions and guided us on the number of dishes to order.

As for the meal itself, there were some dishes that we enjoyed more than others but the common undertone throughout was that they were all quite salty.  Since I lean on the side of savory over sweet, I was surprised that even I thought the food had too much salt.  

Out of the 3 dishes I personally had (SO had other meat items), the Xtapodi which is the brussels sprouts salad was the favorite.  The preparation was very unique with lots of added crunch from the pomegranate and pumpkin seeds.   This is a must order.

As another app, we tried the papoutsakia ""little shoes"" and while I loved the eggplant and mushrooms mix, we thought it had a little too much cheese for the veggie ratio; Could be a personal preference though.  

The politiki came out last as the larger dish and the octopus was very very tender.  However, the rest of the dish with the hilopites (greek pasta) was heavy handed with salt and tomato sauce.   

Overall, it was more like a 3.5 rating with a 5 for ambience and service but lowered for some of the food.  I would give it another go though if someone suggested it.  Could be that there are other dishes like the Xtapodi that we didn't get to try!"
39,Krasi,5 star rating,7/22/2021,"Krasi has one of the most beautiful interiors out of all the restaurants I have been to. Honestly, I didn't really understand their menu dish names, but just show your server pictures and it'll be all good. Each dish was gorgeous and also tasted great. My favorite was the french toast, and we also ordered the omelet and smoked salmon plate which was both really good. 

The prices aren't too bad, especially for Back Bay. Two of us were full after 3 plates (they are meant to be shared) which totaled to about $65 after tip. Expect a wait even at uncommon hours, but the staff is very nice and accomodating about seating. We didn't have a reservation for Saturday at 1 PM but were given two bar seats!"
40,Krasi,4 star rating,12/16/2021,"This place has a wonderful cozy atmosphere, good service, interesting food, and great wines. I especially liked that they had retsina and a variety of spirits. We probably had ten different dishes and enjoyed almost all of them. I liked the meat dishes especially from the rotisserie. The space is small so seating is tight, noise level is high, and social distancing isnt happening. But I am a fan and look forward to going again."
41,Krasi,5 star rating,12/13/2021,"We stopped here for brunch on a Sunday at 10:30 and the place was already filled up. We didn't have reservations but only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. The restaurant is cozy and festive with all of the holiday decorations, lots of Britney Spears and lots of Santa hats. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and attentive. It is tapas style and recommended to have 1-2 tapas per person. For our party of 4, we ended up ordering 6 tapas and had leftovers to take home. Each dish was wonderfully presented and didn't disappoint. We did end up getting the lamb and I was surprised how tender and delicious it was. I'm not usually a fan of lamb since it needs to be prepared a certain way, but they did a great job. I tried the Bellini which was quite good and I ended up ordering another. Not too sweet. I'd caution against eating the apricot, it tastes like it is infused with some type of liquor. My friend got the Bloody Mary which isn't a traditional Bloody Mary and ended up being more on the sweet side. Overall, a great experience. Would return again soon!"
42,Krasi,4 star rating,1/16/2021,"Krasi is a great little restaurant in Back Bay! Our server, Amber, was so great and very knowledgeable. We weren't too familiar with fancy Greek food, so she told us a bit about it. She recommended 4 plates between 2 people as they are shared plates. 
Our favorite plate were the Brussels sprouts that tasted so light and fresh with some pomegranate seeds. Next, we loved the mushroom pita (the pita is a special which changes). The veal dish was also very good -- a bit on the heavier side but the flavor is was very good and veal was very tender. We also had the octopus which we had high hopes for! We didn't love the acidity of the tomato sauce with the octopus. Our least favorite was the salted cod, as it was too salty and reminded me of fish and chips. 
Overall, a very good experience that had some surprising hits and misses. I would recommend to try as something different!"
43,Krasi,5 star rating,6/18/2021,"Just picture yourself in one of those Greek Islands. I haven't been to the Greek Islands yet but this restaurant probably gave me a big push to imagine what it's like and hop on a plane. The food is amazing in Krasi. The food is authentic Greek and they make everything fresh on site. I am going to go here on a regular basis. I fell in love with the Teramasalata, the lamb shank and the grilled octopus. It was sooooo good. The eggplant was just as good and I really enjoyed the orange cake for dessert. The service and staff were delightful.  I can't say anything more than I love this place and you'd be a fool not to try this restaurant out."
44,Krasi,5 star rating,2/27/2022,"I went to this place the other night with a friend and we had a great experience. Although it was busy, it was still great service. The food we got was outstanding, and though we aren't big drinkers - drinks were great too. Can't wait to go back!"
45,Krasi,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"Delicious food through and through. If you come here, you have to have the Portokalopita for dessert. Truly amazing! Lovely ambiance. This is perfect for a date"
46,Krasi,5 star rating,6/12/2021,"Absolutely love this place! I came for brunch with some of my friends and we were seated in the front by the windows. Really beautiful restaurant, from the decor to the furniture and plates, it had a really classic city-restaurant vibes. 

Everything is to share so between the 3 of us, we ordered 4 main dishes and it was perfect. We had the trahana, the dips, the strapatsada, and the avga me patates. We also ordered one baklava muffin just to try! Honestly everything was SO good!!! Both savory plates (strapatsada and avga) were delicious and I'd highly recommend trying both! I can't pick just one! The dips were a nice side, and they offered you more bread if you ran out. The baklava muffin was so yummy, I probably could have ordered my own! It was sweet but a nice extra little side to accompany everything else. My least favorite was the trahana. Nothing wrong with it, it just wasn't my cup of tea. It reminded me of an acai bowl in a way with all the things inside of it. Probably wouldn't get this one again. I also ordered the Aphrodite's Bellini for a cocktail. Perfect, sweet, brunch drink if you want something other than a classic mimosa! 

Overall my experience here was 10/10. From the food to the service to the atmosphere, I get why people love this place so much. I will most definitely be back for brunch again and to try their dinner menu!!"
47,Krasi,5 star rating,12/26/2021,Stopped in on a whim and luckily they had one last table left. The food is AMAZING. Every single dish (and we had many) was special and fresh. This is a do not miss spot and definitely one of the best on Newbury.
48,Krasi,4 star rating,9/24/2021,"Heard about Krasi through a friend and decided to try it out with my sister. The hostess was a bit rude but other than that everything was amazing. The l tzatziki was *chefs kiss*
I would definitely recommend but make a reservation! The bartender was also super friendly and walked us through the menu/different tapas options."
49,Krasi,4 star rating,5/17/2021,"I'm quickly coming to the realization that most (not all) of the restaurants on Newbury street are super overpriced, and Krasi is no exception. Honestly, I Loved Krasi for what it was - super unique mediterranean tapas with a boujee twist. The ambiance is amazing (rustic and fancy) and the plating is beautiful. A lot of the dishes were things I have never head of or tried before, let alone things I could pronounce properly (try saying giouvarlakia three times) but was pleasantly surprised. I came with a group of 6 people and the bill came out to about $450 not including tip (we also ordered a $75 bottle of wine to share for the table). 

We ordered:
Charcuterie & Cheese 
+ OCTOPUS MORTADELLA - House made pistachio, peppercorns, lamb suet
+ LOUKANIKO - Attica, pork, orange zest, cognac
+ SFELA - Messinia, sheep milk
+ METSOVONE - Metsovo, cow's milk, semi-hard, smoked

Apps
+ TZATZIKI  - Greek yogurt, cucumber, dill, garlic, sea salt, sourdough, make it yourself
+ LALANGIA - fried dough, thyme honey
+ PITA - fresh oven-baked savory pie,

Entrees
+ XTAPODI - grilled octopus, Santorini fava, carob honey
+ GIOUVARLAKIA - filet mignon tartare, crispy rice, Krokos Kozanis, chilled avgolemono, dill oil
+ BOURDETO - fresh catch, onion, garlic, red pepper, spicy tomato broth

Out of everything, we loved the tzatziki (a fun group activity) and the bourdeto (super hefty and best bang for your buck) and grilled octopus, which is a staple in any mediterranean meal. The charcuterie and cheese boards were super easy to share and the bread that comes with this for dipping to die for. I thought the portion sizes for most of the things we ordered (except for the tzatziki which was enough for 6 people) were severely lacking relative to the price. I'd highly recommend ordering at least 3-4 items per person if you're coming in a group since the sizes are tapas sized and not ""regular"" entrees. They also have something called the feast of the gods which comes at a hefty $349 with additional $$ if you want wine pairings, however this is a good way to get a taste of everything and leave full. 

Overall, I thought the food was presented beautifully. Definitely was overpriced for what you get but at the end of the day, my friends and I had a great time and loved how shareable most of the food was (ie. One bite each and it's gone). Wish the table space was a bit bigger - felt like we were sitting on top of each other and constantly elbowing each other since all of the tapas couldn't fit on top of the table when they came out. this isn't a place I'd frequent on the regular but it's definitely somewhere I would come for a special occasion on a beautiful spring day!"
50,Krasi,2 star rating,12/20/2021,"Went with one of my Greek friends, super excited to try this place out. Had to make a reservation 2 weeks ahead of time and didn't get anything until 9pm. Ordered tzatziki which you have to make yourself, sorry but I'm not there to be a chef. Ordered the octopus motradella, it was ok but nothing out of this world. Just some octopus with bread. For entree ordered the pastitio rollo, cinnamon flavor was very strong but pretty good, nothing out of this world. Then we also ordered the giouvetsi which was not great. The orzo was good but the meat was all fat and honestly not flavorful. The only good thing was the desert. Waiters were very nice. Very disappointed in the quality of food here. would not come back"
51,Krasi,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"Super cute brunch place! The vibes and staff were so lively and inviting and the food was amazing. The menu goes from sweet at the top to savory at the bottom. Portion-wise, the plates were smaller than a full meal but larger than tapas style. (To give you an idea of it, we ordered 4 dishes for 3 people) 

My favorite amongst all that I ordered was the avga me patates. I loved their savory flavors more but that's also just because I love savory. 

I also got their iced latte to help me start the morning and it was pretty strong, just what I needed. 

Overall, amazing experience. 10/10 would recommend!"
52,Krasi,4 star rating,1/31/2022,"What an excellent new restaurant in Boston's Bay Bay!! This is a great spot for high end Greek food. I came here with my work colleague on a Sunday evening and the vibes were immaculate. Very clean and modern restaurant with an extensive wine menu. We ordered a beautiful orange wine called Paleokerisio that had a hint of sparkle. For food, we ordered the Tiropita honey rolls with Htipiti whipped feta dip. We also ordered the Papoutsakia Little Shoes eggplant and Pastisio Rollo braised short rib. The food was wonderfully prepared and fresh off the stove, I could tell each dish was made with love! The textures and presentation were on point. I personally would have preferred a bit more flavor in every dish but this could perhaps be because I'm Indian and I love my spices! The Tiropita honey rolls could have had more filling but they were soft and decadent. I thought the portion size was large for being mezzo style, I wasn't able to finish my meal but I took it to go! Overall an excellent new restaurant in Boston with a prime location across from Prudential Center. I highly recommend checking out this place if you're looking for new European with excellent wine pairings. Staff are very hospitable as well!"
53,Krasi,5 star rating,12/3/2021,"I am still a huge fan of this place. Have since taken a couple of Michelin-level foodies & budding oenophiles and everyone has been impressed (even those coming from LA & London). Love the selection of orange and natural wines. Have found their servers are always knowledgeable and helpful. Shout out to Nick, who I think has helped us out a couple of times. Our group sampled the tableside tzatziki (HUGE), fried potatoes, olives (available off-menu), & olive bread and everything was delicious. The vibe is trendy & sexy and a little loud. 

Excellent service touches, from the pressed herbs in the menu to wine tastes and occasional bonus dishes. I am blown away by them having not one but TWO Aesop hand soaps in the restrooms. Make sure you visit the restroom for those luxury botanicals. Hand hygiene is very important these days!"
54,Krasi,4 star rating,5/22/2021,"I came here with some of my friends to celebrate our college graduation. We made a reservation and were seated right when we got there at the large table all the way in the back. The menu was very new to us as we weren't familiar with Greek cuisine. Our server was very helpful in explaining the menu items, answering questions, and offering suggestions. 

We got a bottle of white wine to split among the 5 of us. We chose it based on the server's recommendation after we told him we wanted something sweeter and not too pricey. 

As for food, we were quite overwhelmed with all the different options despite our server helping us as much as he could. He suggested that we just do a ""chef's choice"" type of thing, which sounded great to us. We opted for around 10 dishes, and we got to try a wide range of things from pretty much every section of the menu.

Some of my favorites were from the seafood section: makaronada (lobster pasta), xtapodi (grilled octopus), and bourdeto (fish of the day in a spicy tomato broth). 

We also had the giouvetsi (lamb osso buco with orzo) which was great as well.

The other dishes I tried were also good but not as memorable to me so I probably wouldn't order them again.

Overall I would recommend this place! It's a bit expensive, especially considering the dishes are meant to be shared tapas style so you should order 2+ plates per person. However, the atmosphere is nice and the service is great so it would be a good setting to celebrate a graduation, birthday, anniversary, etc."
55,Krasi,5 star rating,11/9/2021,I've been for both brunch and dinner. All I can say is I'm so glad this restaurant opened. I love Greek food and there were enough vegetarian options. The outside and inside are both amazing. Highly recommend.
56,Krasi,5 star rating,12/27/2021,"We had our first (but not last) visit to Krasi last night.  The restaurant is super cute and cozy.  Our server, Jeremiah, was amazing.  He was upbeat, attentive and knew the menu very well.  He made great recommendations and we were not disappointed!

The restaurant has a pretty impressive wine selection.  The food was delicious and portioned to share.  We tried Louza (under charcuterie), paired with a selection of a couple of cheeses.  The board was beautiful and the food was great!  We also tried the Souvla (which happened to be pork) and the Pastitsio Rollo....amazing!  The star of our selection for me, however, were the Trahano Kroketes.  That was incredibly amazing!

My now fiancée proposed to me during this dinner.  The staff was super helpful and sweet helping him get it all ready and presented us with champagne to toast.  Overall, it was a pretty amazing experience.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone and I can't wait to visit and bring friends!"
57,Krasi,5 star rating,7/26/2021,"You must go to krasi IMMEDIATELY!! This is hands down the best restaurant in Boston, not an exaggeration!! I've been to a lot of restos in this city, and never have I ever been transported to another world through the flavors and ambiance I was experiencing. Not only is the food AMAZING, but the vibes were great, the staff was helpful and friendly, and my friend and I truly felt welcomed. We will definitely be coming here until the end of time. 

Also, great date spot!"
58,Krasi,3 star rating,5/11/2021,"TDLR: Krasi has a really well designed trendy look with nice ambiance. You can see the cooks cooking as they are seated on the other side of the bar. The food is decently priced however the flavours just aren't there and dishes lack a well paired sauce like you might expect at a Mediterranean place. 

The long:
 It's clear the owner hired a designer for this place. Everything from the flatware to the plates is gorgeous. The look of everything there has been carefully selected to flow with everything else and it does. This results in a really nice ambiance and atmosphere. 
The staff are very relaxed and the right amount of attentive. One of our main dishes the veal just wasn't pleasant and our waitress without asking brought it away and subbed the chicken in for us. I hate sending anything back but this was truly appreciated. 

The wild boar appetizer we ordered was by far the best thing there with homemade mustard and olive oiled bread. It tasted great and everything complimented each other nicely. 
The lobster pasta had a very healthy amount of lobster in it however they were all tails which disappointed me a little as the tails are far more chewy then claws. This results in a situation where you finish the pasta but just keep chewing on this lobster. The lobster was just boiled and the dish in whole lacked a specific direction of flavour or any sauce, it heavily relied on the natural flavor of the lobster. 
The slow cooker veal was more a soggy kind of mush unfortunately. There wasn't much flavour and was just unpleasant at least for me. I really wish it had some crispy something going on so everything wasn't just mush and some type of sauce with some serious direction of flavour. 
The chicken, this was good but a bit dry and overall again lacked suace or flavour. It was alright chicken, but for the 16 or 18 they charge I wish it wasn't so dry and had a creative direction taken to it as far as falvour goes 

Don't get me wrong the food wasn't bad by any means, it was alright but it was just alright. The service is pretty good, and the place looks gorgeous and very trendy. They definitely have something going here the food just needs to be worked on a little in my opinion."
59,Krasi,5 star rating,3/9/2022,This must be visit restaurant. Its one the best and fantastic place. This place is really wonderful and has excellent interior setting with pleasant atmosphere. The menu is fantastic. The food is really well-prepared and never so disappointing. I like the Tiropita Rolls and Lamb Osso Buco taste really delicious. Other food is must try! So keep coming back for more.
60,Krasi,5 star rating,4/24/2021,"Amazing meal- had such a nice vibe & was fairly priced.  This place allows you to try many different flavors through small plates & served elevated Greek food.  My favorites of the night were the Giouvetsi (lamb orzo) & the Portokalopita (orange cake).  

There's something for everybody- definitely check this place out!!!"
61,Krasi,5 star rating,6/12/2021,"An absolutely wonderful experience! Every dish was amazing but surprisingly the tiropita rolls were the star of the show! If you come, definitely start your meal with a few rolls. 

Every dish that came out was so flavorful and each had a unique taste. One of the dishes you must try is the ARTICHOKE A LA POLITA! Everyone at my table LOVED this dish.

Are server was awesome and even ended out night with delicious complimentary shots! 

Next time I come, I will definitely bring a larger group and try the FEAST OF THE GODS which has pretty much everything on the menu other than the cheese and charcuterie items."
62,Krasi,5 star rating,3/28/2021,"Such a great take out meal! I havent had a meal that I enjoyed everything from beginning to end in a while. Everything was delicious! Savory pie had a nice crust, braised octopus was perfect, enjoyed the sea bass crudo, orzo in lamb osso buco was nice and creamy, and the brussel sprouts and promegranate  combination was just right to cut through the heaviness of some of the other dishes. For dessert,  orange cake and kaimaki ice cream!! Cant wait to try some of their other menu items!"
63,Krasi,5 star rating,12/16/2021,The food here is so incredible. And if you don't know what to get the staff will walk you through the menu. I love bringing friends here for dinner it's a whole experience. So unique. Amazing wine list.
64,Krasi,4 star rating,4/6/2021,"A very fun night out for Greek tapas with options to dine outside on Gloucester Street, inside at a table or bar-side.  We had fun mixing our own tzaziki followed by more shared small plates of moussaka (rich eggplant bechamel), pita (reminds me of pizza- not my fav of the 6 we tried), lamb osso buco ( fabulous), pork rotisserie, fresh catch grouper (melt in your mouth).  Service was very attentive with our friendly server in training and his mentor and he made wine recommendations.  We felt well looked after with others dropping off items to the table so everything was served as soon as it came out.  We did not have room for dessert.  Would definitely go back."
65,Krasi,1 star rating,10/18/2021,"Honestly, the food here is average at best and IMO it's overrated and too expensive for what it is. But the reason for the 1 star? This place does fine in terms of business and they aren't hurting for money. For an establishment off Newbury street, this place sure does skimp on customer comfort. We were seated outside along with the other half of the restaurant with weather in the low 50s with a strong breeze and they don't even have heat lamps out here. I'm shivering my ass off as I write this and can't even seem to get a waiters attention to put our food in. Not rushing back here anytime soon, but def avoid at all costs in the cooler months if they do not have indoor seating available.

EDIT: Just had a massive Rat run into my leg. I guess this isn't their fault as we're eating outside, but this is the first time in my life this has happened, even after living in NY 10 years"
66,Krasi,5 star rating,10/10/2021,"I've been here twice: once on my own and once with my husband.  I absolutely love sitting at the bar, which overlooks the grill/cook area.  It's dinner & a show.   The food is amazing but what makes things extra special is the amazing friendly staff.  They make you feel so welcome and special.  We tried a bunch of the dishes and all were amazing but my favourites are: the TZATZIKI dip, PAPOUTSAKIA ""LITTLE SHOES""  eggplant, TSIPOURA  grilled sea bream, and the lamb Osso buco.  This is the kind of place I could become a regular!"
67,Krasi,5 star rating,5/14/2021,"This place was amazing!! The waiter was very knowledgeable about the wines and he let me try a bunch of wines to make sure I liked them. You can describe the type of wine you typically like and they'll suggest a wine for you. 

The food was delicious. Definitely come here with someone who will share plates with you and make sure to sit at the bar on the very right side. You get to see all the food being prepped and scope out what dishes to order. Also the guy prepping and directing the food was my favorite. I asked him what every dish coming out of the kitchen was and he was super helpful and made the dinner so much more enjoyable."
68,Krasi,5 star rating,8/30/2021,"This is one of those places you think about not reviewing so no one else can find it but...obviously people will find it, and honestly they deserve all the stars. Came in for a late night snack and wine date and were happy with all of our choices. Our waiter (I'm sorry I forgot your name!) Had wonderful recommendations for folks new to Greek wines and the orange and red we had were spot on to the preferences we had mentioned. Topped things off with some bread (you could come for just the bread...) and octopus, and know we'll be back soon to try other parts of the menu. 

Ambiance was beautiful, we were neatly spaced out from others at the bar, and getting to watch the kitchen do their magic was just the cherry on top. If you catch them on a good weather night, their outdoor setup is real cute too."
69,Krasi,5 star rating,4/30/2021,"This place was AMAZING. The staff, the food, the atmosphere, all great! To start off I had made a reservation for a Wednesday evening (didn't think it would be busy but it was so make a reservation) and the staff member had called to confirm that day. I had mentioned that the website said only bar seating was available so I booked that, but asked if we could have a table, if they happen to have one open when we showed up. No worries if they didn't. 

When we showed up the place was very busy, and they had actually given us this giant table for about 8 in the back, just us two. It was very kind of them to do this. Next, we had both gotten sparkling rosé, which my boyfriend was not very familiar with but loved. The waiter was very patient with us and explained how the ordering/meal was supposed to go, and when we did order he made it so we would get things at different times (in an order he chose with us), to make it so we didn't just get everything at one. 

Here's what we got and in which order he did it for us: 
1. Lalangia bread (so warm and sweet, highly recommend)
2. Mastelo cheese (also highly recommend)
3. Tzatziki (make it yourself, which was a very cool concept. Ran out of bread so they brought us over veggies as well!)
4. Lavraki (I've never had sea bass, and just the presentation in itself was awesome)
5. Giouvetsi (This lamb plate was like a stew, and was very heavy, but tasty) 

Overall I would recommend getting about 4 plates for 2 people, even though 5 is recommended. 

We finished off with the kormos which was also different and delicious!"
70,Krasi,5 star rating,4/5/2021,"I don't know what I was expecting but this blew us all away. Each dish was better than the first. A restaurant that can serve ""plain"" rotisserie chicken and makes you want 10 orders of it- that's a best of the best restaurant. We started with cocktails- the mango mimosa was so delicious. smoked salmon. dips. Two different egg dishes. The chicken. And ended with the sweet bread- I can't wait to go back here."
71,Krasi,5 star rating,4/4/2021,Went there again for brunch! Great service and great food! Krasi never disappoints me! Highly recommend the Greek coffee! It tastes like Turkish coffee and I loved it!
72,Krasi,5 star rating,7/28/2021,"So Krasi is the best restaurant in Boston for Greek and Mediterranean food. I'd end my review there but I will highlight why Krasi needs to be the next restaurant you visit.

Krasi doesn't just pass the vibe check, it is the vibe. It's an intimate location tucked between Boylston and Newbury. The place is buzzing and always has groups of people waiting outside in hopes of snagging a last minute cancelled reservation. I once made a 10pm reservation because I simply couldn't end my night without eating here.

The wine and drink list is A+. I highly recommend the orange wine. I'm not much of a wine drinker but the orange wine on their menu is light and refreshing.

When you're ready to order, there is nothing you could get that wouldn't be good. Seriously every single item on the menu is fantastic. However you must get the Htipiti, the table side tzatziki, the patates (omfg my mouth is watering), daily pita, Skioufikta, and daily souvla. Oh and I just made a reservation for this weekend.

The service is also top notch. The staff is knowledgeable and very good with recommendations for food and drink pairings.

I really can't say enough good things about Krasi. If people ask me where they should eat when visiting or locals wanting to try something new, Krasi is the first restaurant I recommend. Thank you for existing"
73,Krasi,5 star rating,3/15/2022,"Do you go to other restaurants? Stop. Just stop, and before you do, come here first because wherever you are going isn't as good as here. Still the best restaurant in the city for two years. chris is still running this place better than ever."
74,Krasi,3 star rating,7/16/2021,"Beautiful, friendly and super hot spot. We dined at the bar and could not have been more graciously trreated. The food unfortunately was mostly a chip dip small plated. The deconstructed taromasolata was terrible. If you can imagine ordered pimento cheese and getting a block of cheese with peppers poured overtop, you get the idea. All Greek wine list no AF options."
75,Krasi,5 star rating,8/17/2021,"Delicious food and great service! Especially loved the table Tzaziki which involves the customer, having you mix the ingredients into the yogurt. Really fresh food and amazing wine."
76,Krasi,5 star rating,1/15/2022,"Incredible. We got the Noumboulo, Htipiti, TRAHANO KROKETES, GIOUVETSI, and PORTOKALOPITA. Would recomend all. Smaller dishes so I recommend sharing about four between two people. Incredible service and a great music selection."
77,Krasi,5 star rating,9/24/2021,"Went for dinner and drinks on a week day afternoon. Krasi was bustling, with great food and an extensive Greek wine list. The service was wonderful. We also really enjoyed the atmosphere. Would definitely recommend!"
78,Krasi,5 star rating,7/8/2021,"I stumbled on this place upon my Yelp searches and had been wanting to try it for some time. We decided to go with another couple and made a reservation- which is a must! Even with our reservation, we still needed to wait for about 20 minutes before we were able to be seated. This was ok as our friends were running a little behind. The place was absolutely packed, and rightfully so. We were seated and our waiter gave us the low down of the menu. He was extremely friendly and helpful. A friend of mine had recommended the orange wine that they serve there so that was immediately what we asked for. They have 3 types of orange wine so we were unsure of which one to get. The waiter was very helpful and pointed us to their most popular orange wine- Vlahiko/DEBINA. It's a semi-sparkling wine with almost a beer after taste. Definitely unique. 

As Krasi is a a tapas bar essentially, we were told that for 4 people we should order anywhere from 8-10 dishes. We opted in for the following: 

-Lanlangia: their freshly baked fried dough. Very tasty and definitely worth trying! (8.6/10) 
-Graviera: a hard nutty sheep milk cheese. Comes with bread too! (8.2/10)
-Tzatziki: this was a fun one! We actually were able to make the dip in front of us. The waiter brought out all of the ingredients with some directions of how and what to add to make it just right. We were also able to take the directions home so we could make the dip there as well! The dip also comes with a basket of bread so no need to order extra. (8.7/10)
-Salata: this was a super flavorful salad. I'm not much of a salad gal but I would 100% order this again. Super refreshing and tasty. (8.9/10)
-Patates: exactly what it sounds like. They are essentially like home fries with a very faint lemon flavor. (7.8/10)
-Papoutsakia ""Little Shoes"": very good! Especially if you like eggplant and cheese and mushrooms! Worth the try! (8.5/10)
-Makaronada: tasty lobster dish! (8.5/10)
-Skioufikta: was not a fan of this. Was VERY Smokey in flavor. However, the others seemed to like it! (7.2/10)
-Giovetsi: I thought this was decent, but everything else we ordered seemed to be better than this (7.8/10) 

We definitely ordered the right amount. I started to fill up quickly as they bring out the plates as it is ready to be served. The boys left still feeling hungry though. 

I would definitely go back! The ambiance is great, and it's a fun dining experience with great food! Highly recommend!"
79,Krasi,5 star rating,8/17/2020,"Really good spot! 
They have a very solid wine selection. Definitely something for every taste and prices are relatively reasonable. 
Service was really good! 
But the most important, the food, was definitely excellent! 
We had 9 dishes for 3 people, a lot of food since the portions are quite generous but everything was tasty! 
The slow cooked veal, the dips and the peach salad were our favorite!"
80,Krasi,5 star rating,2/2/2021,"Wow. Krasi knocked it out of the park. I cant believe this is the same owned as Committee, because I think Krasi blows that place out of the water. Similar to Committee, Krasi has a ""see-and-be-seen"" type of vibe, which is always entertaining, and the space is beautiful. I love the open kitchen concept.

It all starts with the wine list, which is comprised of nothing I've ever heard of before or could ever pronounce. Greek wine isn't massed produced like other regions of the world, so this was really neat to get to try different ones. Our waitress was very helpful to pick something out for us, based on flavor profiles that we asked for. They also had more than one orange wine, which was great to see, as its rare to see in a restaurant, but something I personally love to have to kick off a meal.

The food was all extremely flavorful and well executed. The whipped feta had a mildly spicy oil drizzled over top, and was accompanied by uber-crispy chicken skins --- such a wonderful cheat food item. The beer battered salt cod was a well balanced dish of creamy, salty, and crunchy. As far as the savory side is concerned, I thought the octopus was the star. I don't know that I've ever experienced such a subtle piece of octopus in my life; I could cut it only using a fork, which is unheard of. The Orange Cake, to end the meal, was also a delight, as it was extraordinarily moist and tasted like a freshly squeezed (but slightly sweetened) orange. Like every dish at Krasi, it was expertly balanced."
81,Krasi,4 star rating,8/10/2020,"Krasi was an absolute delight! I did think the meal overall was pretty expensive, but if you're going to treat yourself do it right and come here. It's a shareable small plate vibe so come with friends or go on your own, can't go wrong!

Their Htipiti dip and Midia are both must-haves! The Htipiti comes with these delicate crisp chicken skins that you basically use as chips. Perfect combo! You only get three so be sure to make the most of it. They do charge for extra chicken crisps so beware of that when they make the offer (didn't know this until we saw the check). I would encourage everyone to get some bread to start so that you can also spread the dip from the Htipiti on that as well. You will most likely have extra dip.

Now when it comes to the Midia (instantly salivates)...it literally melts in your mouth! As soon as I took the first bite I knew I ate what is my favorite dish at this restaurant. It has a sort of tempura look and flavor. Comes with 5 mussels so I recommend everyone at the table get their own so you don't have to share with anyone at your table hehehe!

FYI- If you come with a big group (5-7) consider ordering the Feast of the Gods! This includes everything on the menu except for the cheese and charcuterie boards. Great way to try everything if your group is interested."
82,Krasi,5 star rating,12/6/2020,"WOW WOW!

This is a must go, folks! Cuddle up in this cozy joint and enjoy some of the most authentic Greek plates offered in Boston. Upon arrival, be prepared to wine. Our fantastic waitress (Amber) took the time to walk us through the extensive wine list. 

Food, ambiance, service and so on is all 5/5. Kudos to you, Krasi!"
83,Krasi,4 star rating,8/1/2021,"Krasi is in a very good location and has a decent sized outdoor patio. 
It gets a 4/5 solely for the suboptimal service.  The ambience is very sweet and their cutlery is very ""old world"" and has a certain charm to it. 

Brunch: 
Strapatsada- this truly stole the show! I'm not the biggest fan of eggs or omelets, but this was absolutely delicious. The feta was not overpowering and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly. The entire dish came together really well. 5/5 ! 

Brunch dips- delicious! The htipiti and tzatziki were very delicious. The sourdough was buttery and delicious, but certainly not enough for the amount of dips. 5/5! 

Baklava muffin- this was rather underwhelming. Tasted more like corn bread with honey than baklava muffin. I didn't taste any baklava in it. 3/5!

Drinks: 
Krasi mimosa- really delicious, but I wasn't the greatest fan of the mango juice. 4/5! 

Otto's Spritz- tart but fruity! The perfect summer drink! 5/5

Service: 
We were first greeted by someone who I can imagine was the owner/ manager. He was incredibly polite and welcoming and seated us right away. But unfortunately, things went downhill from there. Our waiter barely checked in on us and it took two attempts to just get water!!! At 3pm, told us that their kitchen would be closing and asked if we wanted to put in any other orders (which is rather odd for the kitchen to close between brunch and dinner on a weekend!). We thanked him and said no. We had finished our meal, 20 minutes went by and he didn't come by at all. Unfortunately, I think this may have been just this one waiter, as we noticed that another waiter was very attentive to other tables. Once he finally came back, he asked ""just the check then?"" Honestly, I really would have liked another drink, but I was very annoyed by him, so we just paid and left."
84,Krasi,5 star rating,1/8/2022,"Went here on a Saturday at 11 and got in right away with no wait or reservations. One thing that stood out to me were the delicious drinks! I tried both the Aphrodite's Bellini which had apricots and and the Krasi Mimosa with mango. The drinks were refreshing and delicious! In regards to food, I had the Solomo which had smoked salmon, lemon dill cream cheese and carob bread. Honestly it was one of the tastiest things I've ever had! The Trajan's was refreshing and tasty as well. It had fresh figs and fruits and was absolutely delicious. Overall, great experience and ambiance. Very vibrant and fun and the food and drinks were delicious."

86,Krasi,3 star rating,12/22/2021,"The place is a cute little Greek restaurant with excellent service! They have a great collection of Greek wines as well. 

The food - I ordered the lamb 'souvla' (grilled), the kale salad and the tuna sashimi. The lamb was very dry, tough and flavorless. The fish was not much more flavorful either. The salad was decent. 

I may give it another try"
87,Krasi,4 star rating,8/11/2021,"I literally don't know the name of these dishes, but we ordered the octopus and the lobster for two person. We also had a honey bread which is similar to churros. I really like the octopus especially the sauce underneath it was similar to hummus but so much better! Lobster was good too it's just a bit salty for me personally. The bread was alright it's a bit sweet and apparently my friend likes it a lot. I'll definitely come here another time just to explore some of the other things on the menu that I'm interested in."

3,SOJUba,5 star rating,3/26/2022,"10/10!!! Threw a 20+ person birthday party here and was super pleasantly surprised by how seamless and fun the experience was! 

They had some huge booths in the back to accommodate our large party and kept the rounds of drinks and food coming out consistently as we ordered. We tried a few different soju pitchers (lychee, strawberry yogurt, kiwi) and they were all delicious. Their appetizers were great too - some favs were the crunchy corn, soy garlic chicken wings, and kimchi pancake.

The vibes are quite dark and loud so maybe not the best place for conversations but it was great party atmosphere. Our server was super attentive and amazing - definitely order the birthday shot if you're celebrating!!!"
4,SOJUba,4 star rating,3/18/2022,"This place is huge. Unlike most Korean drinking spots, it is great for large groups and you can make reservations. When you walk in there is a giant soju bottle decoration with a tiny sign that says don't lean on it... I'm sure that request is never followed on the daily. This place seems to be more of a staging/pregame spot before the clubs and birthday party spot. There were 3 birthday's the night I was there giving out multiple liqueur shots to the birthday boy/gal.

The food was pretty solid. Avoid the bulgolgi nachos, it's movie theatre nachos and cheese, with lack luster tomatoes and a weird sprinkling of what looked like ground beef with bulgolgi seasoning.

What to order are the boneless fried chicken, soldier stew, and the chicken gizzards. I know, chicken gizzards sound bizarre but give it a shot! One cultures exotic is normal for for others! It's a great drinking dish while you take shots of soju and converse. They crisp it up with garlic and top it off with sesame oil. The boneless fried chicken has a nice sweet sauce topped with strips of fresh scallion that brighten the dish. When the soju starts kicking in, get the soldier stew (great group dish). The origins of this meal is from the Korean War. The soldiers cooked whatever was left behind by the Americans and cooked it up in a big hot pot. It has chunks of spam, hot dogs, ramen, rice cakes and kimchi in a spicy soupy stew."
5,SOJUba,3 star rating,3/14/2022,"The appetizers were extremely greasy and oily. We ordered onion rings and chicken wings (original korean fried and sweet chili) but didnt finish them. 

Soju was very good,we tried 7-8 flavors. The service is also quick. Good ambience with great music."
6,SOJUba,5 star rating,4/9/2022,"Went before 8pm...great service and a decent price. We got the corn cheese, japchae(without beef) bibimbap, and Tteok-bokki with cheese. It was 4 of us and we ended up paying about $25 each including tip. 

Highly recommend the japchae and cheese corn....my personal favorites"
7,SOJUba,4 star rating,1/12/2022,"I was so impressed with the kimchi pork belly and the kimchi pancake!! 

A really popular bar - it was my first stop after I got the plane and it was popping even at midnight. The watermelon w/ cotton candy was fun to drink with friends & overall I didn't expect to eat such yummy Korean food in Boston!"

11,SOJUba,5 star rating,3/21/2022,"Our server Winter was the best! She recommended the most amazing dishes when we were stuck between the two types of hot pots. In the end we got the boodae one with not only kimchi but also spam, sausages, rice cakes and rice! We also got the cylindrical spicy rice cakes on the seafood scallion pancake which was the perfect amount of thickness and quite crispy haha the vibes where immaculate but special shout-out our waiter who we love!"
12,SOJUba,3 star rating,12/13/2021,"** Bar / restaurant blend focused on Korean food / drinks located next to Fenway park. Good for a place to party with friends after a Sox game, but for anything else I would honestly say its extremely overpriced and not worth going out of your way for.

I came to the new location across the street on a trip to Boston after failing to get into the old location 3 years ago not knowing it was right after a Red Sox game with the entire street packed. It was absolutely a nightmare getting in and out after a game, so definitely keep that into consideration if you want to go.

I went with a group of around 5 friends, and it seems like the space has relatively bigger booths that can fit groups as well as longer tables as well. Out of the food we ordered - seafood pancake, chicken gizzard, chicken wings, jap chae, none of it was memorable or anything special. On top of all that, $18 for a bottle of soju is just straight up extortion, but I guess thats the premium you have to pay in Fenway. 

Overall the place has a bar atmosphere with loud party music playing, so if you're there to celebrate something or turn up you might enjoy it but otherwise I'd say this place is a pass."
13,SOJUba,2 star rating,10/23/2021,"Food: normal
Service: Shitty(not the waiters inside, but the staffs in charge of the queue)
Environment: noisy
*They check IDs for everyone no matter you order drinks or not. You should be 21+ to enter this place.

If you are looking for good foods, it's not a good choice. If the you wanna dance, the songs suck. Would not come back again. What a waste of time."
14,SOJUba,4 star rating,11/5/2021,"Came here on a Saturday night and the place was packed - I'd definitely recommend a reservation, especially if you're bringing more then 3 friends!

I haven't been here since they got the new space and it's HUGE - lots of tables, many TVs ( all playing kpop music videos ), and a lively atmosphere. We were seated at one of the booths and ordered over 5 pitchers throughout the course of the night along with some food. The service was pretty nice and attentive which was appreciated as our order load was gradual throughout the night. 

The food was pretty good - no complaints about anything other than the boodae jungol as the dish was just served on a plate without a heat source. As a result, the vegetables weren't cooked at all and it got cold quite quickly... Maybe they don't serve it over an open flame for security precautions? This took away from the quality of the meal overall though. 

I enjoyed the rest of the dishes - the corn was hard to eat without any spoons, but otherwise was really delicious. The chicken was crispy and cooked to perfection with a good amount of sauce, the pancake was the perfect amount of crunchy and savory, and the fries were plentiful and delicious. No complaints about those or the pitchers really - I found each one we tried ( kiwi, yogurt, lychee, and aloe ) to be flavored well. The amount of ice was a little disappointing, but there was enough for probably 8-9 shots per pitcher. My favorite flavors were probably yogurt and lychee, but all of them were delicious!

Overall, if you're looking for a fun night out with friends, SOJUba is a great place to go! I'll definitely be coming around again for another fun time, good food, nice vibes, and nice service!"
15,SOJUba,3 star rating,4/11/2021,"I came in a party of six on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. The front staff was kind of curt and aggressive, but I tried to not let that bother me. We were seated at two small round tables next to the bar. We asked to be moved to a booth since there were 6 of us, but the waitstaff said our party wasn't big enough... when I legit saw parties of 4 and 5 sitting at booths. It didn't make sense. 

We ordered the bugolgi, and the soy garlic fried chicken wings. The bugolgi was okay - I realized that this bar wasn't really the best place to order legit food. It tasted pretty bland, which was disappointing. The soy garlic wings, on the other hand, were so good! I literally devoured them! (I couldn't take a picture because I ate them too fast). We also got multiple beer towers and soju bottles to share. As you can imagine, the scene got pretty messy. However, everything seemed to be incredibly overpriced for the value we received. 

The service was poor. Our initial ""greeting"" from the front staff was very off-putting. Then, as we were looking at the menu, literally 3 different people came by and asked us if we were ready within a span of 3 minutes - either they don't communicate or they were being aggressive... I couldn't tell which one. Then, after we got our food, the waitstaff legit never came by. I saw them just standing in a clump and talking amongst themselves for a while. I had to walk up to the bartender to get anyone's attention. 

Overall, my friends and I had a great time, despite the overpriced food and drinks, and the less-than-stellar service. I don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon for the above two stated reasons, though."
16,SOJUba,3 star rating,1/10/2022,"Omg this place is so LOUD! It's definitely a club/lounge vibe. Don't come here to have conversations, because you will not be able to hear each other. 

I've gone here twice, and each time the music was trash. They were playing like Justin Bieber's baby...and a lot of other throwbacks. Wish they would've played more current music or kpop or something. It's like they're purposely trying to troll everyone. 

The watermelon soju is underwhelming...don't be fooled by the cotton candy. It looks aesthetic but is has a horrible flavor. 

I think the best drinks were probably the yogurt ones, though overpriced. The staff is also really unclear with their communication and are definitely hired based on looks rather than capability. Like either you have the drink or not, what does ""maybe"" mean  can you go check??"
17,SOJUba,5 star rating,3/25/2022,Wow amazing i love it so much. The store let me change music. Wowwwww. I will come back every weekeend
18,SOJUba,1 star rating,8/22/2021,"Worst Korean restaurant ever. First called in to see if they are open during the Hurricane Henri weekend, the server literally told us the hours are available on Google and Yelp. Let's start with service, our server was rude as hell, apparently she was upset because the bartender wasn't flirting back with her since he was talking to the other female server the whole time. We were in a party of 3, we got a small bar table instead. We ordered 5 dishes, a small bar table wasn't gonna fit all, and she won't give us a bigger table when the restaurant was only at 10% capacity at 6:30pm. 

She never checked in on us about the food we got either. How is this even considering 'restaurant industry' service? Service like this where they don't deserve a tip

Food: cheese Katsu, that was probably the worst appetizer they could have on the menu. The fried chicken, omg they were soooooo bland. They tasted like frozen packaged goods except 7-eleven chicken prob taste better and more flavorful LOL. Corn cheese and Japchae were pretty decent 

Suggestion for Management? Go train your employees again"
19,SOJUba,5 star rating,12/20/2021,This place was great.  The Omelet was waaay bigger than we expected but good.  The Bulgogi Nachos was just soso but the ambience and soju made up for it.  Def expect a very loud environment and to raise your voice when talking.  We enjoyed the soju and the Kpop blasting on the flat screens!
20,SOJUba,2 star rating,11/16/2021,Long line just to sit at a pocha w loud music where you can barely speak to your friends. bottle service at a restaurant- 300$ per bottle just to jam at your table. Kind of ridiculous. Service kinda sucks on top of all this. Don't waste your time or money here.
21,SOJUba,4 star rating,8/29/2021,"Food was good, alcoholic drinks made us sober, service was meh. Like a night club vibe with music and ambience on a Friday night. Plus points for being open late as there weren't many food options that late at night. Menu is huge and can get overwhelming.

Steamed dumpling: good, how a steamed dumpling should be. Nothing that I would remember. Did not enjoy the sauce. 
Korean Fried Chicken (soy and garlic): was a hit for us and one of the more memorable dishes we tried in Boston. It was crispy and sauce was addictive with slight sweetness to it. Not the best we've ever had but it hit the spot.
Lychee Soju Pitcher: we just had ciders some place else so thought this would be a good ending to the night and get us buzzed. Thought we were being smart by ordering a pitcher. Delicious lychee flavor, but the drink somehow made us REALLY SOBER. They mixed the drinks themselves. It would probably be more worth it to get a bottle instead.

Service and ambience: service was just ok. No one was really rude, but did not feel friendly either. More like indifference and they are just doing the work and trying to get it over with. So felt like we were bothering when asking for suggestions, etc. A little slow with following up with us later on in the night. Dark and club/bar vibes.  Huge restaurant but everyone seated on one side. 

COVID precaution: employees do not wear masks. Did not notice any sanitizers. Tables are spread out a little."
22,SOJUba,4 star rating,12/25/2020,"I was looking for an Asian restaurant with outdoor dining and ended up finding SOJUba on Yelp. Although they had closed down for outdoor dining already, there was plenty of seating indoors to space yourself from other groups of those within your oarty safely. 

I ordered the stone bowl bibimbap, and it really hit the spot! Not sure if it was the best one I've had, but it certainly is high up there. I also was able to try the watermelon soju, which comes in an actual half-cut watermelon with cotton candy attached to it. The drink's alcohol flavor was very apparent, and not to my liking, but this may be a personal preference thing! It was very cool to get to try this drink finally since it looks so cool in the pictures. 

Definitely also appreciate the BTS music playing on the screens. Would come back after COVID-19 ends with a group for sure."
23,SOJUba,3 star rating,4/3/2022,The ambiance of this place felt like a sports bar mixed with a night club. The food was just okay. Service just okay as well.
24,SOJUba,4 star rating,7/14/2021,"I went with a group of 7 on a Saturday night. I made a reservation and they told my friend that they couldn't find it. I got there a few minutes later and they suddenly found the reservation.

There's a two hour limit. We got a beer tower (64 oz for $85 of either budlight or Budweiser), beer and soju tower and two flavored soju bottles ($15). It is pricey. I've seen cheaper prices of flavored soju in nyc.

We also ordered three dishes: steamed dumplings, scallion pancakes, and ramyun ddok-bokghi. Steamed dumplings came within 15-20 minutes after ordering. Other dishes came an hour after ordering. Food is average, nothing special.

Came out to be about $40/person. You go for the experience and to have a good time with your friends. There are tons of big TV screens, some playing music videos (k-pop, hip-hop, pop) or sports (soccer and UFC that night)."

Don't come here unless you want to pay for a new ID. What a joke of a restaurant, all this to pay for marked up Soju and microwaved food lol"
26,SOJUba,4 star rating,11/15/2021,"Sojuba was really good. The soju pitchers are really good! Got the peach one and it was amazing. Also got the scallion pancake, spicy chicken bbq and spicy beef. They were not as spicy as I would have liked but both had a ton of flavor that made up for it. Both dishes come with rice as well. The ambience is interesting and I think it turns into a lounge later into the evening. Big screens to watch the game and other videos while you eat."
27,SOJUba,2 star rating,2/13/2022,"The atmosphere is interesting, but nicely fun and energetic. The service on the other hand is terrible, and we basically had to beg to put an order in. The quality of the beef is very low, and dishes were brought to the table 10 minutes apart. The Korean BBQ is by no means authentic, and is way too sweet. They automatically charge 20% gratuity (click the buttons for you) and make it awkward if you question it. 

All in all, not worth the price we paid. I would not recommend."
28,SOJUba,4 star rating,11/19/2020,"This was my first time coming with a few of my coworkers. 

For drinks we tried their mango ice cream soju and the aloe soju pitcher. I personally preferred the aloe soju as it was less sweet and something I was able to sip on while eating. However, the mango one was an especially satisfying drink after work. 

We ordered their crunchy corn as an appetizer which came out quickly. It was salty and slightly sweet with a caramelized coating for each kernel. A very addicting dish to order. 

The entrees were ordered family style including a small order of Korean chicken wings, beef japchae and bimimbap. I loved the japchae as it was served with plenty of vegetables and tons of flavor. The bimimbap was good, the rice and veggie proportions were appropriate. The Korean fried chicken had a beautifully crunchy layer on it with a brushed on coating of sauce. The flavoring was decent but not the best I've had.

Overall, good experience and definitely would come back. When we got there at 5, we were the first ones there but it was very busy by the time we left at 7 (plan ahead)."

34,SOJUba,4 star rating,10/1/2021,"The food was great 
The only 2 problem were 
1. It took them too long to bring the food
2. They didn't bring all of our order at the same time and the time difference between them was so long that we decide to share our food. So we eat one and when the new one came we all eat that one. 
It is ok when you are with your close friends 
But not acceptable 
Stuff are polite and fast"
35,SOJUba,2 star rating,8/8/2021,Came before a concert at Fenway. Hoping to go up to the roof deck but it was closed because the restaurant doesn't have enough help. It was ridiculously understaffed. On a concert day they should have been more prepared. It took 40 minutes to get our first round of drinks. 2 of us got our meals after 40 minutes and the rest of the group had to keep waiting another 30 minutes. The chicken wings were cold when they came. Food was relatively bland. Overall a bad experience. I won't be coming back. Do not recommend.
36,SOJUba,5 star rating,1/26/2022,Came here for my birthday awhile ago. Great music great atmosphere! Lots of fun. They have so many different kinds of soju and they all taste awesome
37,SOJUba,1 star rating,2/26/2022,"The bouncers refused entry for my friend, calling her fat which lead to her having to have an eating disorder. No woman should ever be called fat to her face and laughed at while trying to enter a bar. As an establishment they should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. Every time we call to speak with someone, it either goes to voicemail or they immediately hang up on us when we ask for the manager. Terrible management and even terrible bouncers."

39,SOJUba,4 star rating,7/29/2021,"I came here for the first time last weekend and I have to say it is unique compared to other places around the area. This is one of the more well known Asian bars in Boston. They have a large menu for drinks (mostly soju based as the name hints) and an ok menu of food. I would say the food here is just for you to snack on while drink with friends rather than a meal. We ordered the corn, japchae, and fried chicken (half soy garlic, half spicy). The spicy wasn't that spicy but overall the chicken was good. We only ordered bottles of soju and the soju pitchers for drinks. The soju is much more worth than anything else bc he pitchers are super small and I'm not eve hold more than what's in one bottle of soju. This place is great to come with a large group tho!"
40,SOJUba,5 star rating,10/29/2021,"this place has a great vibe and the staff are very friendly and inviting, I would highly recommend and get the green apple soju. The pork dumplings are very tasty too."
41,SOJUba,4 star rating,9/22/2021,Great vibes and drinks. We ordering the watermelon soju that actually came in a watermelon with cotton candy. Scallion fried chicken is now my favorite over the normal wings cuz it's boneless and tastes better! The army stew however is a let down probably because it didn't come with the gas stove. It got cold quickly and the ramen noodles were soggy from the soaking not from being cooked...
42,SOJUba,3 star rating,6/10/2021,"Came here on a Saturday night with some gf's for a GNO, and can only say that I'm not at all impressed.

FOOD: We ordered the fish cake soup and the bibimbap. The food was good, but not excitingly fantastic. If you're looking to dine, I'd go elsewhere. 

DRINKS: We ordered 3-4 bottles of soju. As what others have said, it's definitely pricey. We also ordered a round of ""birthday shots"" which I'm pretty sure is just straight sugar in each shot.

AMBIANCE and SERVICE: Loud DJ, loud music, dark room with colorful lights and TV screens everywhere. The music that night was just okay. I usually like to dance/move my body to music, but music wasn't cutting it. The crowd leans more towards the younger spectrum (which makes sense considering it's near many of the colleges in Boston). 

Service was just okay. It took us a bit to get both food dishes out and an even LONGER time to get the birthday shots. It took so long that the birthday girl couldn't even take her shots because she had to leave (about 30 minutes). Really?"
43,SOJUba,4 star rating,1/26/2021,"The service was good, covid procedures were in place. Can be a little pricey but the food was good! Would come back again for hangouts. A very large size bar with lots of TV. It seemed like there is a karaoke area but we didn't make sure. We got the army stew - very large portion and flavorful. Nothing fantastic"
44,SOJUba,2 star rating,12/20/2021,Good vibe and spacious restaurant. food is bad/ greasy / oil. I wouldn't be here for the food. 2 stars for the vibe and spacious restaurant. drink is expensive. $30 for a small pitcher of kiwi soju....with mostly ice
45,SOJUba,2 star rating,12/21/2021,"rating this PURELY on food. as a place i would hang and get drunk at, yes i think this place is a sick bar and is a weekend contender - they actually have some pretty good soju and its better than half the junk i had living in korea for a while. so being clear on that before what im saying

the food is horrible though. barely salty and not even spicy, which is a bare minimum for decent korean/bar food. this ranges from their stews to even their pancakes, which is incredible since its hard to undersalt a scallion pancake

just laying this down for people that have never had korean food and think this is the truth. it only is in so far as your drunken calorie intake is at a blind peak"
46,SOJUba,4 star rating,11/29/2020,"Wanna know what an ABG is? Come to Sojuba. 

atmosphere reminds me of koreatown/LA. Love the giant TVs playing super addicting and mesmerizing K pop music videos. People come here to get LIT. 

Food is 3.5-4 out of 5. Been here too many times to count in the last 2-3 years. yes you must try the yogurt soju. Bon Chon all flavors are bomb (the spicy one is actually spicy), chicken katsu, boodae jungol YES with spam, kalbi tang. The Korean bbq is alright... compared with LA I would give this a 2/5 but I guess for Boston it's probably a 4/5."

50,SOJUba,2 star rating,11/10/2020,"I appreciate their wide selection of soju drinks, but my experiences here have always left me confused.

I first came here over a year ago when they were at their smaller location across the street. All the napkins they gave us were wet and smelled moldy. The fruit cocktail ($25) was meant for 2 people but was barely alcoholic at all. We then ordered another bottle of soju and it was expired! For a place that literally has soju in its name, I was shocked. The music was quite loud and seemed to jump through a bunch of different genres. It seemed like they couldn't decide on what vibe they wanted.

I decided to give this place a second chance and to experience their new, larger location. The music choices were still VERY confusing, but I won't hold it against them. The napkins didn't smell like mold this time, but the cups and plates we were given were still wet. We ordered a makgeolli ($15) which came in a metal pot with metal serving bowls. Maybe this was for the ""authentic aesthetic"" but the serving bowls were dented, old, and looked dirty.

The food here is decent, but I wasn't blown away to the point where I would come back for the food. I tried their wings and kimchi pancake. Portions were on the smaller side for the price."
51,SOJUba,5 star rating,6/19/2021,"I really enjoyed my first experience at SOJUba. My friends and I were seated quickly and our server was very hospitable. I appreciated the Korean music playing, which I noticed changed to American rap as the night went on. Our food and drinks came out in a timely manner and we all had a great time! I loved the overall atmosphere of this establishment and will be sure to make another visit when I am back in the area."
52,SOJUba,5 star rating,11/7/2021,"Yummy Kalbitang soup! Was super congested all week with a head cold and this soup, ordered spicy, was just what  the doctor ordered. I woke up feeling amazing. The order was enough for me to have leftovers the next day. Can't wait to order this again."
53,SOJUba,5 star rating,10/6/2020,"Came here for dinner and so glad I did! If you're looking for good Korean food, good music, and a good ambiance, I would definitely recommend coming here! I got the mango ice cream soju- literally DELICIOUS and must get!! Very refreshing and such an easy drink. I also can't say enough about their CHEESY CORN!!! This is the best cheesy corn I've ever had, and I always order this dish when I visit Korean restaurants. It's very flavorful and cheesy. I highly recommend. Their crunchy corn was a great snack in addition If you're looking for something sweet. Their bibimbap was also a great choice to go along with all of the other food. Come here if you're looking for good food and a good time in the middle of the city!"
54,SOJUba,5 star rating,2/18/2022,I have been coming to this place for 3 years!! Amazing food and great vibe!  Love their sojus
55,SOJUba,2 star rating,4/18/2021,"I frequently come to sojuba the service has been great some days and awful some days. The drink selection is great! But the food has disappointed me every time I come. I've tried out countless items on the menu and I am always disappointed. I think the only food I like on the menu is the bibimbaps. The atmosphere is great if you're looking for a going out type of vibe with friends and want to enjoy drinks! I love that, but on super busy nights the service can be really slow, and everything is extremely pricey for what you get."

57,SOJUba,2 star rating,9/12/2021,"Came here for the dining because me and my partner were craving Korean bibimbap. I decided to get the stone bowl bulgogi bibimbap, which was 2$ more than the non stone bowl version. However when I got it, the rice was extremely overcooked, mushy, and the base wasn't even crispy like normal stone bowl bibimbap should be. On top of this, when we went to pay for the meal, our server added a 20% tip without our approval, and she was definitely not deserving of this! We had to always flag her down when we needed something and she was not attentive at all. Overall it was a great ambiance, but subpar service and food."

59,SOJUba,1 star rating,9/7/2021,"Terrible experience from staff to the wait time to the food quality. 

Table of 5, seated quickly. We ordered a round of drinks, 3 beers, a sangria and a cognac.  I asked the waiter what soju was, the drink, and his reply well it's the name of the restaurant... really buddy, I know that... what is it on the menu. Very rude, so I didn't order the soju drink. Are Drinks arrived staggered, no big deal. 

We placed our appetizers and they arrived staggered 15 minutes after the other....another inconvenience that we let go by. 

We then had to flag our waitress down to place our entree order. We ordered 3 garlic noodle and Korean hot plate. One garlic noodle arrived right away.....The hot plate which was spam, cut up hot dogs and kimchi with a .50 cent ramen noodle on top, it was disgusting, arrived 20 minutes later.... The last garlic noodle arrived after we flagged down the waitress and requested our check.... We told her we didn't want it and conveniently she could no longer understand us. So we said just pack it to go and she plops it down and says I can't do that I'll get boxes. Also very rude. 

At the end we were charged $290.00 for 5 people, among us 5 only one round of drinks were ordered and 3 appetizers an appetizer that didn't get eaten at that because it arrived as we were leaving. They also added a $50 tip to the order... doing the math our total is only $193.00 and the ""mandatory"" tip which isn't stated anywhere should only be $38.40.... 

Stay away from this place. Terrible service, subpar food and shady billing. 

I'm also going to be reporting them, I truly feel they overcharged us on purpose."
60,SOJUba,3 star rating,8/16/2020,"The new location is a lot bigger and has rooftop seating. Unfortunately if you sit on the rooftop there's a limited menu. Before being seated, we were told we couldn't order any hotpot, stone bowl, or watermelon soju on the roof, which we were fine with. However, when my friend tried to order a mango ice cream soju cocktail, she was told that wasn't allowed on the roof either (no ice cream cocktails on the roof at all). They should be more transparent about this limited rooftop menu to avoid frustrated/disappointed customers.

We were also given a shot glass that had cracks and chips in it, and I overheard this happening to the table next to us too. That's really dangerous and the servers should be more aware of things like this before it even reaches the table.

It also takes a while for servers to come around. We initially ordered drinks and asked for more time to decide on food, and our server said she would come back. She never came back LOL we were waiting for so long... we had to flag down another waiter who then became our server for the rest of the night. Not sure what happened to our initial server.

Mediocre service aside, the food is pretty decent. There's a lot of variety and everything I've tried so far tastes really good. I HIGHLY recommend the crunchy corn, cheesy corn, and sweet chili wings (not spicy at all!).

The price of the soju hurts my soul considering it's like $1/bottle in Korea and $15/bottle here but that also seems pretty standard for restaurants in this area so I can't complain too much. The ice cream / yogurt soju cocktails are fun and taste good but they cost even more, like $19?? And they don't even use an entire bottle for those cocktails. Just make that stuff on your own at home, it'll be wayyy cheaper and it's not hard to make.

Overall, this is a good place to grab a drink, eat some Korean food, and hang out. I've also celebrated some birthdays here and it's a good time. The rooftop is nice and the inside looks clean and spacious."
61,SOJUba,5 star rating,10/14/2020,"We had such an awesome time at SOJUba, in fact it was so great we had to come here a second time a few days later. During Covid, there aren't a ton of places to go out for late night drinks with a good group of pals. Luckily, this spot is the perfect solution. Not only is it open late with great drinks, but we felt really safe with the precautions they took --even putting up plastic dividers between each booth.

Our server, Eric, was one of the highlights of the visit. We notified him that it was my friend's birthday, and he instructed us through a proper soju bomb demonstration! Couldn't be happier. Definitely come check this spot out for a great, safe evening!"
62,SOJUba,1 star rating,7/26/2020,"Just a heads up- if you're paranoid about covid or whatever, just stay away from this place.  Also, sorry about the pictures I'm about to post.

I've been really cautious since the whole pandemic started- I've ordered out only a handful of times and have yet to dine in at a restaurant...until today...and I regretted it immediately.  My friends had reassured me of the covid health guidelines implemented by restaurants across the city and I've been seeing many pictures on social media, so I decided to give in. 

Given the current circumstances, you'd think bathroom maintenance would be a top priority since everyone would be in there constantly to wash their hands. Nope, not the case. There was THROW UP in every. single. stall- including the trash can!  And no toilet paper, or paper towels (hand dryers available).  Apparently it was the same situation in the men's bathroom as well.   How are they even open right now with the bathrooms in this condition during covid?  I really don't know.

We also had to dine using paper plates because they ran out of plates, but that was fine- one time use, I guess."

70,SOJUba,1 star rating,12/18/2021,"Arrived 30 minutes early for a large party and asked if we could be seated. Then we were told we couldn't be seated because we didn't have most of the party. We were nice about it and just asked if we could go to the bathroom while we waited. As we were walking to the bathroom, one of the hostess told us we could sit at our table, but we still went to the bathroom first. After we sat down at the table a bouncer came over to us and asked us why we were sitting. We explained what happened previously but he was giving us attitude and wasn't listening to what we had to say explaining the whole situation. Even telling us that they could only seat full parties not most of the party as we were told by one of the hostesses. Eventually, the hostess seated us came over and told him that it was her fault that she seated us so early. We were allowed to sit at the table but it honestly was just chaos and wouldn't have happened if the staff just communicated better with one another. 

The main point here is that there's poor communication between the hostesses and the bouncer which led to a bunch of employees coming up to us with attitude of why we were sitting at our table."

72,SOJUba,1 star rating,2/15/2021,"I'd give it zero if I could. Where to start...
I brought my parents out to dinner for a visit and it was a nightmare. Server was obviously new to the trade. Brought my fiancé a 4oz glass for a can of beer when he asked for a draft. Then told him they were out and the bartender brought the second.
Another note. The restaurant was empty, and they sat a 10 top of college kids (loud, live your life, but away from my parents) right next to us so I had to yell to my dad. Over the twerk contest Korean pop music they blared. It is a Korean sports bar. And I can tell you it's not.
Ordering food. My dad was ignored. And she had to re-ask for the order. Mom was told no for add ons but fiancé was told yes, so she asked again. Next. My fiancé's fried rice came out after we were nearly finished. So I didn't eat to wait for him. The rice was over cooked. Wasn't fried. The shrimp and chicken were rubbery and overcooked. He ate two bites and sent it back.
The server refused to take it off the check and charged us for it.
She said ""it's out of my hands, he ate it""
My dad (being the polite man he was, said no to seeing the manager) and we left. Will never return. I will tell everyone, and anyone they should never try this place.
All they add is sugar. First off. Fried rice is brown sugar, not white, soy and sesame sauce."
73,SOJUba,5 star rating,1/30/2022,Very nice staff and the ambient is great. Drinks and food are really good. Would highly suggest it!
74,SOJUba,3 star rating,9/11/2019,"I have a friend who always has her birthday dinner at Sojuba. And I get it: it's a fun place for a celebration. It's like if a club decided that it wanted to be a restaurant. There's a disco ball, laser lights, and music vids with accompanying loud music (bring on the K-pop!) on multiple screens. 

You can make (large) reservations, which also lends itself well to birthday plans. There are flavored sojus & fun soju cocktails (like one with a melon popsicle in it and another in a watermelon) as well as beer towers. And if you get a birthday shot, they play a birthday song and dance it over to you! It's fun. Overpriced, for sure. And most patrons seem to be college kids, which may or may not make you feel old. But it's still fun.

The menu is large, with many (mostly Korean) offerings. The wings (soy garlic, medium, or spicy) are always popular as are apps like the scallion & kimchee pancakes. I always go for the Korean rice cakes (ddok bokghi), which come in a delish spicy sauce, and you can order them with different toppings like seafood, veggies, and fishcakes. It's a big portion for $12, and I split it with another person. The steamed pork dumplings were $8 for 6, and they lacked flavor - pass. The service was a bit disorganized for our large group. We had a number of different servers, and it was sometimes difficult to track someone down. They also took our orders at different times and brought drinks/food at different times. We also could only split our group of 25 on 4 checks, which proved to be difficult when it was time to pay.

Overall, Sojuba is a fun time if you have a fun group! Dance along to the K-pop (I love the English translations of the lyrics at the bottom - hilarious), and drink some more soju!"
75,SOJUba,5 star rating,5/19/2021,Living just minutes away from this place I wonder why I missed this all this while being a cocktail fan. Love love their melonba and the cheesy juicy corn side!
76,SOJUba,4 star rating,1/8/2020,"If you want to feel like you're in Korea, this is the bar to go. They have kpop and mainstream hiphop on blast all the time. In my opinion its like a mix between a bar lounge and a mini club. There is strobe lights and occassionally a DJ present. 

I've also tried the food here and for late night eats (open til 2AM) with the atmosphere and drinks, its not bad at all. Especially if you get the drunchies, the selection of korean food is really good such as the budae jigae or just some classis fried chicken wings. If you're feeling adverturous then the chicken gizzards are one of me and my friends favorites. Definitely one of my top places to go for a chill night out with friends."
77,SOJUba,5 star rating,9/25/2021,Great foods great music and perfect atmosphere!! I love Korean food and they really have great Korean Fried Chicken here and Suju are wonderful too!! I highly recommend this place!!!!!!! I'll definitely come to this place again and bring some new friends!
78,SOJUba,5 star rating,7/22/2019,"Probably as good as it gets. Everyone loves coming here to pregame or to hold big gatherings with their friends, and I can definitely see why. SOJUba is the spot for big groups of people because you're able to cater to so many with drinks and food. I'd recommend making a reservation or coming early if you have a large group of people, but the wait for getting a table shouldn't be too bad (30-40 minutes?)

The best part of SOJUba is the ambiance with the food. It's so fun jamming out to your favorite hits along with chowing down on delicious Korean food. I've only done family styled meals here, but the portions are big enough for 2 people to share. I love getting the budae jjgae, which is a big hot pot that has ramen, sausage, spam, rice cakes, in a spicy broth. This is probably one of their most popular dishes and it can probably cater to a good 3-4 people. Their soy garlic is pretty good, crunchy and full of flavor. The glass noodles, jjapchae, wasn't my favorite because it was too saucy for my liking but it still had the classic taste of it. Their cheese corn and their tteokbotki is pretty standard, didn't blow me away since it tastes like other restaurants. 

However, I must say that the crunchy corn is HANDS DOWN my favorite dish to get here. I love this because it's crunchy, sweet, and savory all at the same time. It can get a little messy while scooping it, so I'd recommend ordering it in a bowl. 

Soju is average price, I love the grapefruit or the strawberry. If it's anyone's birthday, the birthday shots are delicious! 3 sparkling sojus and they stop the music to turn on their cool birthday song remix. 

Again, ambiance is great to come with a large group, but it can get loud. Very casual and the service is fast and friendly. I definitely can't wait to be back!"
79,SOJUba,5 star rating,10/22/2021,"Great food, great drinks, great music.

Loved the atmosphere front to back. I came here with my friends looking for a good time and great food. Some places near Fenway only focus on being a sports bar.

Sojuba is lit."
80,SOJUba,5 star rating,10/21/2021,"I love SOJUba and their music. Great atmosphere, and the lights are cool. The skeleton is cool. The waiters are very cool. Family ties"
81,SOJUba,4 star rating,6/18/2020,"I've been to Sojuba at least 10 times and really no other Asian bar in Boston compares. K-Pop music plays until around 8 p.m., and then hard rap starts to blast for the rest of the night. Expect LOTS of colorful lights, loud chatter, and the occasional ""it's your birthday"" rap interruption. I love this place. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good night (just at Sojuba or before heading out to another bar/club). This is definitely for a group hangout opposed to a two-person dinner. 

Sojuba has two sections: one with typical tables for food and drinks, and another with a bar/standing room. If you're coming later at night, make sure to bring your ID--they're super strict with carding!  

I've gotten everything from soju to soju-beer to their North Korea birthday bomb shots. If you're a sweet tooth, I recommend the Melona soju cocktail. Otherwise, have a good time and order rounds of flavored soju! 

Food-wise, this place is pretty good too. Boodae Jungol is the ultimate comfort food, and the seafood scallion pancakes are worth it! If you want reasonable one-person portions, I recommend the stone bowl bibimbap. 

This place isn't five stars because the service isn't always amazing. I've had to wait 30 minutes to an hour past my reservation time on multiple occasions, and sometimes getting the waiters/waitresses' attention is tough on a busy night. My advice is to come around 9 p.m. on a Friday or Saturday and then stay for two hours; any later and you risk standing around for a long, long time."
82,SOJUba,5 star rating,10/10/2021,Went on a Sunday at 1 am and the manager was super accommodating. I asked for for more hype music and he was happy to turn it up. I always come here with the boys to celebrate. Honestly one of my favorite places to come. Be prepared to have a great time.
83,SOJUba,5 star rating,10/8/2021,"Kimmi is the best. Definitely order
 whatever she recommended and never regretted. Fun night and good drink. Food is okay."
84,SOJUba,5 star rating,6/17/2021,"Went there on a sunny Sunday in the late afternoon and sat by the window. The vibes are great, the drinks are great, the service was good, as is the food. Would recommend if you are in the Fenway area."
85,SOJUba,5 star rating,1/7/2022,"Awesome !!! Great food, music and decor. We love to go every time we have late night cravings."
86,SOJUba,5 star rating,9/25/2021,I literally love this place.  Best drinks and better music. Yes. The best vibes in Boston. Chris is amazing!
87,SOJUba,1 star rating,5/30/2021,"No idea why this place has such good reviews. The service is poor, we waited for three hours for our food. There are five of us and each dish takes 30 mins to an hour. By the time the first person finished his meal, there are two of us who haven't had their orders. Also, the food is meh. We were also told that there's a minimum charges of $25 per person. Ridiculous place"
88,SOJUba,5 star rating,9/17/2021,"Good service, food and drink. Fun vibe with friendly people. Great location with easy parking."
89,SOJUba,5 star rating,8/3/2019,"Fun lounge to be at with a group of friends. A fun ambience with loud music you can jam to, DJ always giving shout out to the birthday peeps. Food are surprisingly good for lounge food. Soy garlic chicken wings + drumsticks are food with the right amount of flavor and the chicken are not over fried or under fried. Seafood stir fry udon has a ton of seafood with the right flavors. Korean oysters are huge with a kick of Korean style so don't be surprised that you don't taste cocktail sauce with the oysters. Soju are decent prices. Not crazy expensive as I expected for Fenway.

Overall thoughts: great vibe and a fun lounge ambience to hang out with a group of friends (or a party of friends) while enjoying eating together the Asian family style and drinks. DJ are great at picking songs, not like some boring DJs that can't get a good vibe going for some Boston clubs or wedding receptions."
0,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/10/2022,"Ordered delivery.

The Chicken pho GA is awesome!  There is something about the broth thats simple yet effective.  sprouts, noodles, cilantro, chicken, scalions, thinly sliced onions, and basil come with it.  I had no idea how exactly to eat this the first time, so I used a large bowl. But the plastic container the broth comes with is just big enough to host all of it minus the noodles.  Slowly add noodles as you are eating and no need for a separate bowl.

I don't add Hoisin Sauce, since the subtle flavors of  each ingredients coupled with the broth is flavor enough.  Very soothing to eat too, especially when hot."
1,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/7/2022,"In 1972 ""The Bangcock"" opened on Mass Ave a few stores down from ""Pho Basil"". It lasted over 40 years, was the first Thai and absolutely best Thai restaurant in Boston and I measured every other Thai restaurant to its standard.

Pho Basil has taken over the mantle

Massaman curry has the perfect amount of cinnamon and the correct amount of heat that hits you on the aftertaste

Pad Thai noodles were also perfect - just sweet enough and the right amount of peanut flavor 

A true 5

We'll done"
2,Pho Basil,4 star rating,1/25/2022,"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Boston. I was introduced to this eatery while my daughter was attending college in Boston. 

Luckily  during my recent stay in Boston, my hotel was just two blocks away. I was able to place my order online, pay, and pickup- the second time around.  

Let me explain, the night previous, I ordered  for Grubhub to deliver. The driver delivered my meal to the wrong hotel. I called the restaurant to inform them of the issue and they said I had to handle it through Grubhub, therefore the 4 stars. I was refunded my money but that left me to find dinner that evening. Thank Goodness the hotel had tasty bar food. So the disaster was remedied. 

In sum, the food was just as I remembered it 10 years ago, DELICIOUS!!!"
3,Pho Basil,5 star rating,3/14/2022,"Came here on a Tuesday around 7pm and there wasn't a wait, which I was very surprised about because I heard this place is poppin. I got the bun bo hue which was super flavorful and the portion is decently big. The only thing was the server told me the noodles were vermicelli but when I got them they seemed different... but maybe because I specified I wanted white noodles and so they changed it? Not sure. Overall great food and great service for a great price!"
4,Pho Basil,4 star rating,12/29/2021,"Great ambiance! 

Real good food!

The service is good and heartfelt.

It was quite busy when I was here, both Wednesdays. First Wednesday for dine in and second Wednesday for takeout."
5,Pho Basil,4 star rating,10/28/2021,"This is a very solid pho place to satisfy a craving. Can it compare to the Vietnamese places I've tried in California? No. But it is a great option in the middle of the city. I would go here over Le's.

I got the bun bo hue ($12.95). The bowls are huge but they mostly contain broth. The broth was lighter than I am used to but still packed with umami. The color of the broth was deceiving because it was not spicy at all.

Like I mentioned, the bowls are full of broth so the actual noodle portion actually wasn't too big. The portion size was fair for the price, though. I was a little annoyed at the onion slices that came with my bowl because they were tough and fibrous (maybe an old/bad onion?). The noodles were supposed to come with flank steak, rare steak, and tendon, but my bowl mostly had  flank steak. There was one small piece of tendon. To be fair they give a lot of meat."
6,Pho Basil,5 star rating,12/28/2021,"sO GOOD. favorite thai restaurant.

i usually give pretty good reviews but this is like one of the highest ratings i will ever give

what we got:
tom yum fried rice with chicken (10000/5 yums): this was so good. so flavorful and the rice was PERFECTLY cooked. the chicken was sliced thin enough where it soaked in the flavor and it wasn't dry at all. it had a very strong basil taste and a slight kick but was SO GOOD
pad thai with tofu (10000/5 yums): at first glance, it lowkey looked unflavorful. the color isn't really a deep red or brown, more of a slight red. HOWEVER, the smell really showed the IMMACULATE flavors. it was more on the tangy side than sweet and the noodles, although looked soggy, were ACTUALLY INSANELY CHEWY. it was so good
thai iced tea (5/5 yums): less sweet but the condensed milk flavor was peeking through (usually i don't taste it) SUPER GOOd highly recommend.

now conclusion: the PORTION SIZE WAS SO HUGE LIKE OMgz. i ate so much like this would have been 3 meals for me. also the service was amazing. they gave us serving spoons and extra plates. honestly just amazing."
7,Pho Basil,4 star rating,8/3/2021,"Service, portion sizes: 5/5
Noodles, toppings: 4/5
Broth: 3.5/5

We came here for lunch on a Sunday and it was decently busy, mostly with people getting the lunch specials. We got the Pho Tai and Bun bo hue. The pho was okay but nothing special -- the noodles were plentiful and the steak was decent, but the broth didn't have much depth of flavor. The bun bo hue was better -- the meat was super tender and the broth had a bit more flavor, and the noodles seemed a bit overcooked/sticking together but still good.

The service was great and the portion sizes were super plentiful, but the broth wasn't so great."
8,Pho Basil,3 star rating,5/27/2021,"Look this place used to be great, cheap and well cared for food. I'm a regular here who has gone at least once a month for a few years now. But unfortunately it has gone downhill due to Covid and the influx of people. Don't get me wrong this place used to be a clear Five Stars no doubt. For under $20 a person with over 20% tip you could grab a really quality meal. 

Last year and even through much of Covid they had good bits of quality beef in the beef pho's and they were cut into bite sized pieces. Well portioned with really quality pho. However in the last 3-4 months the beef and meats included have become increasingly fatty with each visit and they have stopped chopping them into bites. Now the meat is in these absurdly large and in thick variations that are impossible to reasonably eat with chop sticks. Not only that but it is stretchy and chewy. 

I loved this place and wish it could go back to that, but I think corners have begun to be cut, prices have increased, and the new business model is coming to your table once when you order and then turning the table over as fast as possible to account for the others waiting outside. 

There's no reservations and you simply show up and hope the line is short enough. The man who runs front of house is very nice but understandably overworked. Just not the same place as it once was."
9,Pho Basil,5 star rating,3/16/2022,"I've overlooked this place over the years because it's tucked away in a very student-y part of town... so I mistakenly assumed it was of moderate quality. Recently, I popped in on the spur of the moment and discovered that the food was fantastic! Genuinely spicy, lighter than I'd expected and just overall wonderful. The service was fast and hospitable. I've now eaten here several weeks in a row, haha."
10,Pho Basil,5 star rating,1/24/2022,"Got takeout from here on Saturday evening, via call in order.

Food: 5/5
We started with the pork/chicken gyoza, which were fine but nothing amazing. We also got 2 Pho Rau Cai, which is outstanding. Great flavors, good variety of veggies. We recommend it over the other veggie pho (Pho Chay, has a sweeter broth). Lastly, we got an order of the Pad See Ew w/chicken, which is really good. Some of the best we've tried around Boston.

Service: 5/5
Food was ready on time and hot. Great value."
11,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/10/2022,Maybe my favorite restaurant in Boston. I go here every week. Great food. Great service. I recommend the chicken fried rice.
12,Pho Basil,2 star rating,11/7/2021,"We were looking for a place to eat pho, but once it became apparent any place worth eating at was going to require a long wait, we decided to do take out. There was a line out the door. Surely this must be a great place. Google says it's good for take out, but they apparently don't have take out containers for eating pho...so we ordered the Thai Fried Rice and Pad Thai instead. We then ordered pho from Saigon Fusion a few stores down which had convenient take-out bowls.

When we got to our hotel room we were very disappointed with the smell and taste of the pad thai. Everything about it was off...borderline offputting. We strongly considered just tossing it. The fried rice was not as bad but was very bland. We put them both in the fridge thinking they would taste better when we're were hungrier or taste worse to justify throwing it away. We had food from the place next door to hold us over. Incidentally, the sharp vinegary smell and taste had mellowed out the next day when we reheated it."
13,Pho Basil,2 star rating,1/11/2022,Takeout pad Thai was only noodles  I was very disappointed and wish there was more variety in my order.
14,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/20/2021,"This was my go-to Thai food place when I was living in the city. I have yet to find any place that makes a better gra pow fried rice, and I almost always get that (with ground chicken) and a Thai tea when I eat here. The one entree alone always gave me another 1 to 2 more meals!

Service has always been friendly and relatively fast despite there always being a line at dinner time (pre-COVID). It's a small-ish place but well worth the wait, or takeout is another good option. I don't think I've ever been disappointed with anything I've tried here."
15,Pho Basil,3 star rating,1/8/2022,"We've ordered delivery from here a few times. Delivery was pretty quick and all food was hot and fresh. 

I always get the Pho Ga noodle soup (chicken) and the hubs has gotten the Pho Tai (steak) and also the Bo Vien (meatball) soup. Love the Pho and all the fixings. Broths are flavorful and herbs (basil, cilantro) are always fresh, good portion size. I always have enough leftover for a lunch soup too. Only thing the chicken is sometimes dry and yesterday it was really chewy that's why only 3 stars. Hubs found his soup overall warm and satisfying but the meatballs were not as amazing - kind of rubbery according to him. Gyoza (steamed) was ok.

Roti n curry dip was nice with a really tasty rich spicy sauce to dip the pancake in. Pad see yu (with tofu) was good and so was the Com Chien (vietnamese fried rice) with chicken.

Overall food is good, maybe a bit pricey but they are in Back Bay so that's probably why. The restaurant seems busy especially with the students around and glad they've stayed open."
16,Pho Basil,4 star rating,12/26/2021,"If you are craving pho on Mass Ave, this is the place to go. 

Food I've tried:
- DAC BIET PHO ($12): the meat was prepared well, and not tough at all. The broth itself was not overly salty, and had the hearty umami flavors I expect from a good bowl of pho. Portion and price was very reasonable as well. 

Atmosphere:
- The store is on the smaller side. Especially during peak hours, there is always a line out the door for this place. 

Service:
- The staff are friendly and we got our food relatively quick.

Overall:
- It is a solid place to go for pho, for a good price and a very convenient location. I personally prefer Le's still as my favorite pho in Boston, as I think their broth is more refreshing."
17,Pho Basil,5 star rating,9/3/2021,"Food taste 4.5/5
portion 5/5 (I feel their delivery boxes are def bigger than other restaurants)
Ubereats packaging 5/5
I ordered this place for ubereats. First of all, wow best packaging ever! They put cardboard in between food to seperate them. Very stable and nothing got spilled. 
I ordered:
Saigon noodle: its more like Pad see ew with a vietamnese name. plus a little bit spicy but not as spicy as drunken noodle. The noodle cooked to the perfect texture and the flavor (sweet salty and spicy) is very food. The only downside is that the chicken is a little bit dry. and there were too few egg pieces in it. but the portion was huge. 
Mi Hoanh Than: traditional pho with three pieces of wonton (another version of dumplings). The lettuce etc, soup, and the noodles came in three seperated containers. I put them together and added the hoisin sauce package included, which make the soup more flavorful. The noodle tasted good, but I have to admit I'm never a fan of pho since the taste is kinda blanc... But my friend loved the noodle soup. 
Spicy tofu eggplant: this is my favorite. The flavor is sooo good and its medium spicy level. I wish there were more eggplant pieces in it. I loved the steam rice it came with! It's not the typical rice you get from other restaurant. It's so soft and have a very special aroma.
Def will come back again to try other dishes."
18,Pho Basil,4 star rating,10/13/2021,"Came here for lunch around 12:45 and had to wait 10 min for a table. Service was pretty quick as the duck noodle soup I ordered was good -- it was a bit fatty and pretty salty but tasty nonetheless. Both bowls also came with the standard raw bean sprouts, mint leaves, and lime. Would definitely come back to try out their other noodle bowls."
19,Pho Basil,4 star rating,10/17/2021,"The menu has a large variety of options. I got the Kao Soi. The broth was extremely flavorful and creamy, and the portion size was very large. The chicken was mediocre. The pricing was pretty reasonable.

20,Pho Basil,3 star rating,8/24/2021,"I went with 2 friends on a Friday night. Warning: they don't seat you until your entire party is there, so plan ahead! 

I ordered the tai pho, since I'm not a fan of tripe or tendon. The broth was very savory and flavorful! I added a drizzle of hoisin sauce, and it tasted delicious! I was disappointed by the amount of meat that was in the soup. 

I also felt that the waitress was really rushing us/pushing us to leave when we hadn't even been sitting there for long. 

Overall, we had a decent experience, but we will probably go elsewhere for our next pho craving."
21,Pho Basil,4 star rating,2/2/2021,"I came in here on Feb 2 2021. They have excellent anti COVID measure in place. Hand sanitizer, large distances between tables, QR menu, and the hot sauce is only served when requested.

The place was quite busy and the server decided to attend our table after taking orders from another table that came after us. This was factored into rating.

I ordered Tai; the seven pieces of beef that came with it were disappointing, very rough and felt old. Bean sprouts were great but they served too little for my preference but by a little. The broth and noodles made up for the dish. I was pretty satisfied as a consequence.

I would come back again happily. I am not convinced this is the best Boston Pho place but it is a pretty good choice."
22,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/20/2022,"No better way to warm up on a Boston cold day. Their pho selection is great, and their plates are big and delicious. Quality food, and great quick service."
23,Pho Basil,2 star rating,8/17/2021,"I am sorry, but I have to write a bad review for this place.  

Our table of three, no one liked their meal.  We got bun bo hue.  I asked what the waitress thought of the bun bo hue and asked if it was ""really"" good.  She was super excited and told us yes.  It was not good.  There was no depth in flavor to the broth.  It should have been more beefy more lemongrass and there was hardly any spice.  

Another coworker got tai pho and requested vegetables to go with it.  The soup came but the vegetables took an additional 15 minutes.  ""Sorry we are busy"" was their response.  

What did I learn today?  The best thing on the menu was the fried spring roll."
24,Pho Basil,4 star rating,11/30/2021,Move away from pad Thai and order Kai soi! It's only of my favorite dishes to get at a Thai restaurant. Not all places will have this dish so I get excited when I do see it in the menu.

27,Pho Basil,4 star rating,8/13/2021,"Came here tonight to try out this place. Very happy we did. The service was efficient, attentive and really good despite the place being very busy and will a lot of takeout orders too. 
Food was good too, the Com Heo (grill pork with lemongrass and spices over rice) was really nice. The broth for the Dac Biet was nicely sweet ( savory sweet, Not sugary sweet) .
I would recommend this place and we will definitely revisit the next time we are in Boston"
28,Pho Basil,1 star rating,10/21/2021,"I ordered food to go and when I got home I lifted the bag out of my car and the whole bag just fell apart. I called and tried to explain that something was leaking and caused the bag to rip. But I was told that the bag was perfect when they gave it to me and that it was my fault. 

I guess I will have to eat the food from ground to give a good review."
29,Pho Basil,5 star rating,12/6/2021,"BEST PHO PLACE I've been to in Boston! The broth is extremely flavorful and the serving size is perfect. It's a nice large bowl with plenty of noodles and broth. The broth was so flavorful enough, you don't even need to add sriracha (unless you want a kick) and hoisin sauce. I got the bo vien pho (meatball) 10/10 delicious. The place is small and there is often a line during peak dining hours (lunch, dinner time). I was lucky and came a bit early on a weekday (Monday) but a line formed shortly after I sat down. That's how you know the place is good - people are willing to wait forever!"
30,Pho Basil,5 star rating,9/8/2021,"I've been looking for a good Asian restaurant (that's not ramen) around back bay and heard great things about this place. Walking in, I loved the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant; it felt both comfy and modern. The waiters were super nice and service was great.

Pho 7/10 - The pho broth here is pretty good; it's a deep and hearty soup. I've tried better broths that had richer flavors, but this soup was decent enough. The noodles and meat was also good.

Kao Soi 9/10 - I really liked the broth they used for this noodle soup. It was a sweet and creamy curry. I also loved the noodles they used which were thin yellow noodles. The noodles were able to soak up a lot of the curry which made it taste very flavorful. The duck was also very moist, but since it's been wicked in the curry, the skin wasn't crunchy.

Pad Thai with duck 8.5/10 - The flavor of this pad Thai was on point and it tasted amazing with the duck. I didn't like how short the noodles were. They had cut up the noodles so that they were only about 1-2 inches long. I wish they just left the noodles long instead of chopping it all up.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone living nearby and craving some Vietnamese/Thai food. The portions are big and you will leave very full and satisfied."
31,Pho Basil,5 star rating,11/23/2021,"Love this place whenever I'm craving something warm and soothing.

My go to is the bun bo hue which is a slightly spicy beef noodle soup. The meat is plentiful and tender. The broth is very aromatic but not as spicy as it looks. 

Their pho is also really great and hits the spot on a cold Boston day. Bowls are large and you'll leave feeling satisfied. The broth isn't as flavorful as the bunbohue but it'll satisfy a craving for pho. 

Service is great! Expect a wait though, they do not take reservations."
32,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/5/2022,Excellent first visit !  Food was fantastic. We will definitely be back soon to try other dishes. Great menu choices !
33,Pho Basil,3 star rating,5/26/2021,"We visited Pho Basil one evening when we were visiting Boston. The restaurant is small but spacious - with covid, menus are obtained w a QR code link and there is hand sanitizer located for use right at the entrance. 

There is a large menu here with a huge selection of food. Overall however, I felt like the flavors were okay - not anything super special. Hours after the meal, I was extremely thirsty which led me to the conclusion that there was a lot of MSG in the food. The amount may have been more than what I typically see as I was consuming multiple bottles of water which isn't very characteristic of me."
34,Pho Basil,2 star rating,12/9/2021,"No bueno for delivery. 
They did not pay attention to the instructions and as a result the food sat at the front desk for about an hour. 
Greasy Roti. Just ok Pho. 

Yelp please let your customers know Ben the food has been delivered ( like other deliver services that provide real-time updates) .  

Disappointing."
35,Pho Basil,4 star rating,4/3/2021,"Duck Green Curry was my favorite. The duck had no gamy taste. The skin was crispy and curry itself was super flavorful.

Chicken Satay had a strong peanut smell. With the peanut sauce on the side, the dish was strong and juicy. Loved it!

The pho and rice noodles were kind of bland and were just fine."
36,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/2/2021,"My go-to Thai place!  Amazing prices & quality- this a great place in Mass Ave to go to.  

I've tried a couple types of pho, curry, fried rice, and noodles & they are all amazing.  I really like all the lunch specials in particular, as they are really cheap and still amazing (with pretty huge portions).  My favorite lunch special is the drunken noodles as they are very flavorful.

Definitely try this place out!!!"
37,Pho Basil,5 star rating,3/7/2022,I don't care what anyone else in this Yelp chain has to say. This is literally the best Thai food in Boston and maybe that I've ever had. SO GOOD. Get the spicy crab Rangoon or the sesame wings to start. The red chicken curry is also amazing. Those are my go to.
38,Pho Basil,5 star rating,3/5/2022,"This restaurant is in high demand! I'd highly recommend it to any foodie in the mood for a light and trendy atmosphere with authentic Vietnamese cuisine. The menu is shockingly affordable, as many college students come through the area. They don't take reservations, and they can get super busy, so Id plan to come in a smaller party. The Dac Biet Pho and crunchy egg rolls are 11/10!"
39,Pho Basil,4 star rating,11/12/2021,"As far as I can tell, you're in for a wait - we arrived around 5:30 pm on a Tuesday and got a table quickly, but the line was well out the door by the time we finished. 

Pho was pretty good, and nicely priced, so I have few complaints. That said, I've had better broth in other places."
40,Pho Basil,5 star rating,12/18/2021,"this place always has such lines from the minute they open to the minute they close for a valid reason! the food here is not only affordable, but really tasty as well.
-you can order for pickup through the phone, and usually, the food should be ready in ~20 minutes depending on how busy they are. you can also make reservations in advance by calling them, except for fridays and saturdays.
-the service here is relatively quick. while the wait can be quite long for a table, the food comes out in 10-15 minutes after you order. so, chances are you can be in and out in 30 minutes once you're seated. 
-i only ever paid in cash during my visits, but i think they accept card payments too.

-dac biet pho: this is probably the most popular pho option on their menu; the beef noodle soup has rare steak, well done flank, tendon, tripe, onions, and scallions. on the side, you also get some mint and bean sprouts to add to your liking. the flavor of the broth really rich and just the right amount of fattiness. there's a fair amount of meat compared to noodles, but i did feel like some cuts of the meat weren't as tender/chewy as i would like. nevertheless, it's a solid choice that'll definitely satisfy your pho craving on any day. not to mention, the portion is quite generous for only $12 not including tax. (4/5)

-chicken pad thai: the hype for this place's pad thai is 100% reasonable. although you'd think that this place specializes more in pho, their pad thai is surprisingly so good. i've gotten it twice, once as takeout and once while dining at the restaurant. i'll admit that the taste is better if you don't opt for takeout, but that's probably unavoidable. you have a choice of protein, such as shrimp, crisky duck, chicken, beef, tofu, etc, which will affect the price of the dish. i got chicken in my pad thai both times, and the portion of it was just the right amount. the noodles also have egg, bean sprouts, scallions,  ground peanuts, and a lime wedge. the best part is the sauce that they used to stir fry the noodles; it has just the amount of peanut flavor, without making it too overpowering. however, they tend to use a lot of oil, which makes the portion even more filling. one order is easily shareable between 2 people, since there's a ton of noodles. normally the price is around $13, not including tax, for the chicken pad thai. however, i'd suggest that you order this during their lunch hour special hours, since the cost drops to around $11 with tax for the same portion. nevertheless, the price is worth the amount that they give, and i'd undoubtedly order it again in the future. (5/5)

overall, even though i wanted to give this place 4.5 stars out of 5, the prices just really can't be beaten. the portions are huge and there's little to no chance you'll be leaving hungry after eating here haha. although i'm not sure how often i'd come back, every experience i've had has been great. i'd highly recommend that you must try their chicken pad thai!"
41,Pho Basil,5 star rating,12/18/2021,This place still SLAPS!!!!! Since opening it has literally never let me down. Hands down the best restaurant in Boston. I love this place.
42,Pho Basil,3 star rating,2/2/2022,"Greetings, I am on a journey to find the yummiest pad thai in the United States. My journey today has brought me to Pho basil. I got back from the airport and was desperately craving some pad thai. I was in a blind hangry rage as I ordered vegetarian pad thai, my usual, from Pho Basil. My doordash driver promptly delivered the pad thai (smart). I immediately dug in. The sauce/noodle flavor was ~stupendous~ but I took issue with the random veggies- red pepper and green beans? so random. also they were kind of stale and the green beans looked like they came from the can. broccoli was sort of brown. but overall the dish was yummies. Not the best pad thai i've ever had, but would probably order again after traveling. My journey continues. Accepting recommendations (would love some in the Boston area!)"
43,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/17/2022,One of the best affordable restaurants in Boston. As a college student I go here all the time. Friendly service and their Tom Yum fried rice with fried chicken is to die for. Their Thai tea is also so so flavorful.
44,Pho Basil,4 star rating,12/20/2021,"I enjoy food there yet it's always crowded. My favorite is pho sate. All in all, I would suggest this place, quite authentic."

46,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/6/2022,Omg was driving down Newbury st starving for some Pho and noodles. Looked on Yelp and found pho basil with lots of good reviews and decided to order duck noodle soup . Delicious!!! Also ordered pad see you. Omg beyond delicious.was a bit messy eating In The car as we don't eat in restaurants re Covid . But it was worth every slurp on my jeans and middle console . Definitely would recommend and will come back again next time I drive into town to shop!
47,Pho Basil,3 star rating,11/30/2020,"I did take out from here - they have both Vietnamese food and Thai food. I usually don't like to order from places that serve 2 different cuisines, but they managed to pull off both Thai food and Vietnamese food well. 
I got the goi coun (fresh spring roll)- this was so so. The rice skin was a little too thick for my liking. 
The pho came with a container of soup, noodles and raw beef in another container, and vegetables in another container. This is smart so that your noodles do not get soggy in the soup. The only thing I did not like was the fact that the raw beef was in the same bag as the noodles, it did not feel hygienic! I quickly threw the raw beef and noodles into the broth in hope of cooking it and killing off any germs. If you do take out for pho, you might want to request to have the raw beef packed separately in its own container. 
The drunken noodles were very spicy but delicious as well. The portion size was extremely generous! 
Overall, delicious food and good portion sizes."
48,Pho Basil,2 star rating,6/30/2021,"I ordered the pad Thai and green curry. The pad Thai was ok, something was missing in terms of flavor, it was to some extend tomatoey.  The green curry was in my opinion the worst curry I've ever eaten. The chicken tasted like it was boiled in unseasoned water and then tossed in the super spicy unflavored coconut milk at the end. It didn't absorb any of the curry flavor whatsoever, I couldn't get the horrendous taste out of my mouth fast enough. The rice was so over cooked that I just put it in the trash. Pretty much a total waste of money. I hate wasting food and that's exactly what I did tonight. I was even disappointed in the Thai tea... even when the food is just ok, the Thai tea is always good. I don't know how this place has 4 stars. 

I've had authentic Thai food in Thailand and this is the third place I've eaten Thai food in Boston and is just so disappointing. I guess my quest continues...."
49,Pho Basil,3 star rating,11/30/2020,"The pad thai was $15 and not very good
The crispy chicken was good - but not $15 food

The crab rangoon cost $7 for 5 tiny pieces but it was extremely tasty. 

My husband's bun thit nuong was really not that good either. 

All made worse by the fact that the original time of arrival by Grub Hub was 1:25 to 1:40 but arrived around 2:30. So compounded by the fact that it was late, it was overpriced and not that great."
50,Pho Basil,5 star rating,5/25/2021,"This place for me, might not be the best for food of all (don't get me wrong, food is still great), however; the service - Wow! Couldn't have asked for a better waitress!

I dined in with my husband yesterday - Monday, our server, Nan, greeted us very nicely let alone her being super busy!

This is not my first time, but my first time with the new menu, a lot of dishes that I've tried and like were removed from the menu, so I asked for a little help from our server. Not only she was knowledgeable about the menu, her recommendations are phenomenal! 

Even though the restaurant was really packed and busy, Nan would always come and check up on us, the food were great! The service was fantastic! Will definitely come back many many more times xxx

I've never left any reviews anywhere, but the experience yesterday deserves 10 stars if I could give that much!"
51,Pho Basil,4 star rating,10/23/2020,"Finally found a spot in Boston that does both pho and Thai food right! The menu is huge with tons of options even for vegans, vegetarians and gluten-free eaters. 
We went for lunch and it was busy but the tables are set apart based on social distancing guidelines and service was quick! 
They even have boba tea! We got the edamame gyoza and it was the best edamame gyoza I ever had! 
Will def be back to try the Kao soi!"
52,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/12/2021,Omg love this place. Drunken noodles is spicy and delicious. Pad see ew is like drunken noodles except not spicy at all more sweet. Highly recommend the Vietnamese ice coffee and Thai tea!
53,Pho Basil,4 star rating,3/11/2021,"Was craving some Vietnamese food so headed over to Pho Basil. We got the grilled pork with rice (Com Heo) and the Pho Dac Biet. The grilled pork over rice was pretty good. The pork was juicy and had a nice char. They gave a big portion of rice and some veggies on the side as well as nuoc mam sauce. The pho was also very good and came with a variety of tripe, tendon and well done frank. Did wish there was a bit more of the meats though. Overall the taste was really good and they separated the noodles and the broth so that the noodles wouldn't get soggy. Their pricing is pretty reasonable for the Boston area. This place is a great spot for some comforting viet food."
54,Pho Basil,4 star rating,1/18/2020,"I enjoyed dining at Pho Basil a while ago and recently ordered takeout, which came right on time despite being a massive group order. The boxes were helpfully labeled and the cartons that had liquid were bagged to prevent mess. (The one unfortunate thing was that there were no utensils, but luckily we had them.) I tried the tofu massaman curry and beef drunken noodles. The flavors of the dishes were really good, and there was a satisfying amount of food. (The rice was really packed into the takeout box, and there were lots of noodles.) I also liked the way the tofu and beef were cooked, and there were plenty of yummy vegetables!

The only drawbacks were that the noodles were chopped to a short length rather being the normal long rice noodles, which are more pleasing to eat, and the curry was a little on the milky side and could've used more spices/flavor. I would still definitely recommend Pho Basil as a solid Thai place and will likely return in the future!"
55,Pho Basil,1 star rating,12/19/2019,"I've been ordering here for several years now, if you look at my last review this has always been one of my favorite places and I order from them at least once per month. 

Though when they stopped their own delivery and started delivering with ubereats and other apps, their service has gotten really bad. 

They almost rarely include any sauces now, ignoring any notes placed on the app - I even sometimes call after I place my order and still they continue ignore any requests - and today for the first time I was given beyond dirty utensils and hair inside the basil bag!!! 

And to be honest, I'm not going to bother calling them because their servers are beyond rude. They were always rude, I mainly went here for the food and didn't care for the service though now even that quality has gone down and I have no reason to be back here."
56,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/2/2021,One of bestt Vietnamese Pho vegetarian version I have had till date! Quantity and the taste was amazing. Very authentic and recommended for vegetarians too
57,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/6/2021,"Pho Basil? Officially one of my favorites in Boston! 

I'm extremely picky when it comes to Vietnamese food. My mom is sometimes too busy to cook so I have to resort somewhere else to satisfy my cravings. I came across this restaurant through Yelp and let me tell you, I am SO glad I had the chance to visit! 

Upon walking in, my boyfriend and I were instantly greeted by employees. Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming. The restaurant is spacious, the tables were set 6 feet apart, and there were hand sanitizers to use right when you come in. We felt safe the entire time. 

I ended up ordering bun thit nuong (vermicelli noodles with grilled pork) and a side of crispy egg rolls. Whereas my boyfriend ordered com suon (rice with grilled lemongrass pork chops). It took approximately 15 minutes for everything to come out. The food smelled and tasted amazing! The flavors were perfect and the portions were big. Our highlight of the day was definitely the service. Our waitress frequently checked up on us and constantly refilled our drinks which were highly appreciated. 

Hands down, the best!"
58,Pho Basil,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"What a pleasant surprise Pho Basil was. We dined on a Friday night and the joint was jumping. We ordered the Drunken Noodles, Crispy Chicken, and Pad Thai. The food was excellent and had a complexity of spices that you would expect at a high-end dining establishment. They were expertly prepared and quite boozy. 
Excellent place and comfortable to dine in. Pleasant atmosphere with great service. Can't wait to go back here."
59,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/1/2021,"10/31/20
My girlfriends favorite pho place! It was a cold Halloween evening so pho was perfect for our weekly date! We were seated quickly and noticed that there were far fewer tables than pre covid times which makes sense. Tables were spaced pretty far from each other. Service was fast and good so no complaints there! Pho was great as well! I almost always get the beef pho with like everything in it and this one really hit! Definitely going to be one of our go tos when we don't know where to go!"
60,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/13/2020,"My number 1 restaurant in my college days. Location is great, easily walkable from the Northeastern campus and close to Back Bay. The wait grows pretty fast during peak dinner hours, especially on Fridays and Saturdays.

This is the best bang for your buck, Thai food that I've ever had. I've come here over at least 100 times by now.

The main dishes I would recommend are the pad thai or pad seew with crispy chicken, pho dac biet. The noodles are super delicious and the portion sizes are huge. The crispy chicken is very juicy and crispy. The pho dac biet has one of the best pho broths I've ever tasted. It also comes with a generous amount of meat and noodles. Either of these won't disappoint!

If your in Boston and your ever feeling authentic Thai food, this is the spot.

Also get the thai iced tea. It's a great addition to your meal."
61,Pho Basil,5 star rating,7/16/2020,"I love getting take-out from here as I always have a reliably good experience: the food is delicious, orders are ready quickly, and staff is friendly. I usually order through UberEats and I've never had any mistakes in my orders.

I love noodles in general, and my favorites from this restaurant are duck noodle soup (excellent soup flavoring and duck meat texture) and Pad See You (very delicious, not too oily like some other places I've had this dish at). I'm not usually a huge fan of rice dishes, but I do like a couple of them here: the Com Chien fried rice is my go-to if I've been having noodles too much lately, and I've also enjoyed the Com Heo rice plate as the pork is especially juicy. Pho is always a safe option as well; my boyfriend always gets pho tai.

I discovered this place after the pandemic started so I haven't yet dined in, but I've seen a few customers dining in since the recent reopening allowed it, and they all look very happy. When I feel safe and comfortable enough to do so, this is one of the first places I would love to dine in at!"
62,Pho Basil,1 star rating,7/12/2021,"The food is not bad. If you are looking for good service, DO NOT GO to Pho Basil. I would give negative stars to the waitress alone if I could. This young woman was extremely rude to me and my 50+ year old parents. She told my mother to go read the menu after we asked a question, and later banged a full glass of mango latte against our table, spilling it to places and onto my father, then immediately left without saying a word. 

Feel free to continue reading about the whole thing. It went like this:

My mom is not fluent in English. I started asking on behalf of mom: Could u change the meat (Chicken, for example) to duck in stir-fry Noodles?
""You need to give me the name of the dish"".
Me checking again if we could have duck meat before ordering one
""Yes, (She interrupted with a rushing tone) YeS I AlReAdY SaId SO bUt you need to GIVE me the NAME"".
I give her the name of a dish, Saigon Noodle, then ask if they have seafood with rice.
""(Impolitely and immediately)No"".
My mom pointed at two pictures, I helped her ask: What are the differences between the two dishes? 
""You need to look at the menu, everything says there"".
She could clearly tell that my mom is not a fluent English speaker. I looked at her in the eye with a smile: so you don't want to explain?
""(answered quickly)You weren't nice to me either"".
Wait. Excuse me?... This whole time, she pulled an unhappy and impatient face. She literally had one job as a waitress, and she couldn't serve her guests. She came back later, banged a full glass of mango latte onto the corner of our table, spilling the drink onto my father and everywhere else, and immediately went away. It felt like she was expressing her feelings by doing that.
When the boss of the restaurant passed us a dish, I asked if we could have a different waitress to serve us the rest of the time. The boss said yes, and I could tell that the boss felt awkward (and a bit sorry). The boss and the second waitress (taller with glasses on) were polite. The food wasn't bad, but clearly, we didn't have a good experience.
We even asked ourselves, did we do something that made the first waitress unhappy? (Notice that we were guests, and she was serving us) All we could think of was when we walked in, we had fries and a drink in our hands, and we ate a couple of fries. She came to tell us that we can't have food from outside. I briefly explained to my mom, and we moved the food away. My dad politely asked if she could come back later and give us a few more minutes to look at the menu. When we were ordering after she came back, I can guarantee that we weren't being rude to her, tho we didn't have much joy on our faces. Maybe she had a bad day, maybe the restaurant was busy, for whatever reason, she let out her negativity and ruined our good time. Good luck with her future life and career. I used to have a good impression of this place, and I was okay with the portion and price, too. Too bad, starting today my impression is changed.

63,Pho Basil,5 star rating,1/18/2020,"I wish we had more of these spots in NYC. I seriously feel they either try but charge an arm an a leg for and ends up failing or they make it affordable and douse everything with MSG making everything taste like everything else of the same. 

Only got the chance to try the bon bue hue. OMG.... OH MAHHH GAWDD. Zee BALLS. were amazing. YES, AMAZING BALLS! Don't even! the noods was cooked to perfection, the broth was savory and warmed up my body quick! Great for winter time! Heck, I'd probably come in the summer too! Who am i Kidding. The combinations of beef tendon, beef brisket, just ..EVERYTHING! It's CRACK TO ME! & wished I had more ! Sadly I'm back to NYC and I shall dream about their noms! 

Would definitely come back to try others. If yelp allows me to throw another star up. I WOULD!"

65,Pho Basil,5 star rating,11/23/2020,"I've never had a disappointing meal here. Amazing soups, tasty noodles, outstanding curry and great service. Also if you have room, they have some fantastic pastries!
Prices are good and service is outstanding."
66,Pho Basil,4 star rating,11/17/2019,"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Boston! The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 stars is due to the inconsistent service and sometimes the food but it's not too terrible to the point where I would never go back.

Highly recommend that if you're planning to come on the weekend for dinner (including Friday), go early! Like 5:00-5:30 early. Because the place is somewhat small and there's no waiting area so you could be waiting outside in the cold standing around for 30+ minutes before your table is ready. 

The best things here in my opinion are the drunken noodle, the masaman curry, the Thai basil fried rice, Penang curry, and now my new favorite is the Kao Soi soup, which is a curry soup with crispy chicken, egg noodles, pickled vegetables, and topped with crispy fried egg noodles. It made me feel somewhat bloated after but it was very flavorful! 

Overall, there's so many dishes to try. Whether you're in the mood for soup or for Thai food, pho basil will not disappoint!"
67,Pho Basil,3 star rating,9/24/2021,"The price is cheap for back Bay Area, but the portion was probably the smallest I've seen at a Thai restaurant so far. I ordered drunken noodles with chicken and the sauce was a little bland and wasn't well incorporated into the noodles. However, my friend got the pho ga and really liked it so maybe stick with the Vietnamese food!"
68,Pho Basil,2 star rating,6/6/2021,"Very disappointed that they changed the menu! No more summer rolls, vermicelli noodle bowls (""bun"" in Vietnamese), and other refreshing items that would have been perfect for the summer. Now the selections are just the average boring Americanized Vietnamese/Thai food. 

PLEASE BRING BACK THE SUMMER ROLLS AND THE VERMICELLIS BOWLS!!!"
69,Pho Basil,4 star rating,10/18/2020,"Every time I go to Pho Basil there are quite a number of people in the restaurant which reflects its popularity. Last time I went there was a 10 minute wait time. Inside the restaurant is very clean but can be a little noisy because of the small space, however it is not a big deal. The staff was incredibly kind and welcoming as usual, and they filled up water cups very quickly. 

I have only tried noodles from Pho Basil, and I highly recommend their Pad See Ew and Drunken Noodles. My other friend had their Pad Thai, but that dish is honestly not their best as the noodles seem to be lacking. There is a bit more flavor with the Drunken Noodles in my opinion which is why I prefer it, but I love the Pad See Ew with a spice level of 3 -- I think the amount is perfect with just the right amount to complement the dish without overpowering the flavors presented. The vegetables seem fresh and I find myself enjoying the different textures together with the noodles.Furthermore, the portion sizes of the noodles are very big and I always take a to go box with me. 

One thing I do not recommend is their bubble teas, and for that reason I took off a star. The tapioca pearls were too overdone and were rather mushy than chewy. It is apparent that they just blend it with powder which I do not like, and couldn't taste the tea in both the milk tea or the thai tea. The bubble teas really did not have much flavor, and the thai tea kind of tasted like melted cotton candy dippin' dots. I was disappointed. 

Besides the bubble teas however, the food is excellent for the price point and their customer service is very good. I will continue to visit Pho Basil."
70,Pho Basil,1 star rating,5/17/2021,"First time visiting because the high rating, new in town, however, very disappointed. The food is good, but not good enough for the rude service. The waitress with the long pony til was extremely rude and disrespectful, we waited long time after we got sit down, but no one seems to notice and come and give us even water. Then we finally see this girl came behind us and clean the table, I try to tell her nicely that we are ready whenever someone can tell her order, then she stare at me with this angry look and rudely tell me that Can you wait. Wow, unbelievable, I also worked in restaurants business for over 15 years, i don't think this type of altitude is right to treat your customers. Not a recommendation if you're someone who want a good meal under good environment."

They have a consistent flow to people coming for takeout, but it wasn't as busy as it used to be. 

Come and support your local business!"
72,Pho Basil,1 star rating,9/18/2021,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE time in this restaurant!!! The waitress told us that we need to wait for 30 minutes to be seated. But actually we waited for like 50 minutes. The table is extremely small. It's a table for two but there is no enough room for two plates or two bowls. It's very hard and uncomfortable to eat by such a tiny table. The portion of pho is big but it's almost flavorless. Not tasty at all. The waitress are very good at ignoring customers. You'll have to wait for a very long time and ask several times before you get any help. After an extremely long time of waiting, we just got some food which is not delicious at all and some service which is not nice at all. A very unpleasant time here and I'll never come again."

Their food never disappoints, with some of my favorites being the pho dac biet, gra pow fried rice, and drunken noodles. Before covid, they were always packed and I would usually need to wait at least 10 minutes to find a seat, which is a testament to how good their food is. Staff is pretty friendly and service is very satisfactory as well."

76,Pho Basil,3 star rating,5/3/2021,Acceptable asian option for the area. The menu is a mix of vietnamese and thai.  The pad graprow is okaaaay but not the best.  Its a little too salty and fish-saucy but the portion was sizable. The chicken satay is decent and the dumplings are good.  The service was very good and the place seems very popular.  I would go again and try other things.
77,Pho Basil,5 star rating,9/22/2021,"If I could give Pho basil 1 million stars I would!!! I love this place so much and only have nice things to say when mentioning the restaurant. I always get Pho Tai which is 100/10 amazing :) Workers are beyond nice and care very much about their customers. My go to place for comfort food!! The only thing is the black ""privacy screen"" by the window table is quite revealing to people walking on the sidewalk and not quite high enough, where they can see you eating. I'd like to recommend something more opaque(see image below)"
78,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/18/2020,"I have been living out of the hospital with my 6 month old baby and with the limited hours in the hospital cafeteria or limited selections I have been having to order delivery several times a week (sometimes several times a day).  Yes, it gets expensive but there is no way to cook or store food here.  So, I have ordered a lot of different foods from surrounding restaurants on UberEats.   This is the first time I have been so wowed I am taking the time out to write a Yelp review.  

Today, I ordered the Dac Biet with extra meat and hot chili oil on the side if possible.  They gave me an extra order of eggrolls and put the hot chili oil on the side as requested but omitted the sriracha sauce which is fine.  Every thing was packaged great especially the Vietnamese iced coffee - they taped the straw hole through with two pieces of scotch tape crossed over in an X.  The coffee was delicious perfection - perfect balance of strong and sweet and creamy.  

The eggrolls was fresh, perfectly fried crispy and good.  The dipping sauce was what I expected and did not disappoint.   Perfectly sour-sweet with some heat.

The Dac Biet was wonderful and satisfying.   The broth tasted like a traditional slow cooked broth with a hint of cinnamon.  The meats were thinly sliced and a perfect ratio.  Thw onions were thinly sliced and the cilantro ans green onions were fresh.  The basil leaves were fresh as were the bean sprouts but I dont eat those. The noodles were a lot and I usually dont eat them but they appeared to be cooked well.  

Some self proclaimed credibility:  As a Southeast Asian I feel like I know my foods from this region. I cook it often and I eat it often."
79,Pho Basil,4 star rating,5/4/2020,"Quarantine Eats:

The pho is wonderful. Decent portion size and a good amount of meat given. I really, really loved the soup. I thought it was pretty authentic.

The avocado smoothie is also good. Not super sweet, but just enough and yet really smooth and creamy.

Had to dock 1 star for the summer rolls.
The summer rolls were the worst ones I've ever had in my life. It didn't even reach mediocre levels. The rice paper was way too thick, leaving the summer roll opaque. The shrimps were super small and I basically was eating mouthfuls of lettuce.

Basically 4.5/5 !"
80,Pho Basil,2 star rating,5/25/2020,"Sadly, I must lower my rating to two stars after a handful of more visits over the past year.

First off, the wait times are usually awful and the staff doesn't do much to make the experience any better. I've been told it would take 15-20 minutes to get seated when it usually took 30-45. Try to avoid this place during peak hours or else you will probably have to wait half an hour minimum. 

Now that's not why I am leaving a bad review... really, it comes down to the food for me. I've ordered a lot of kinds of plates yet none have been really tasty. What really disappoints me is their pho. The soup doesn't taste nice, light, and fresh as I'd expect, it tastes thickened and unpure... This goes for pho and the other special noodle soups - bo kho, pho sate, bun bo hue.. etc. In addition, I usually order yellow egg noodles and it's almost always overdone! There is nothing worse than soggy noodles for me :(. Not to mention, getting extras always results in sadness... Extra meatballs = one or two extra whole meatballs! 

I've also had the curry and rice plates, which were pretty solid but nothing special. 

Onto the drinks... Their Vietnamese coffee can be quite good - you should tell them if you like it more bitter or sweet. The bubble tea is OK but the portion is small and the boba is sometimes hard. 

In a gist:
OK: Fried rice and curry dishes, bubble tea, Vietnamese coffee, most appetizers
Bad: Noodle soups, chili oil

For unimpressive food and drinks, the prices are high. Cheap for the area? Yes, because Newbury is around the corner.. but not compared to that of other Vietnamese restaurants. And why did they have to go and get rid of the banh xeo?! At this point, I'd rather go to Beantown Pho or opt for another kind of food in the area."
81,Pho Basil,1 star rating,8/5/2021,"This used to be my favorite place to eat... but as of lately I feel like the quality of the food has decreased tremendously. Tonight I ordered pho sate through Uber eats. The amount of soup that this restaurant gives you has slowly decreased over the past year... and on top of that, tonight the vegetables for my soup were not washed at all.... There was dirt under the leaves, inside the chopped-up scallions and also on the tomatoes..... what happened to the quality of this place? Please see photos that I've attached"
82,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/8/2021,The best Pad Thai in all of Boston HANDS DOWN! I can't even allow myself to order anything else off the menu at this point because the Pad Thai trumps everything they've got. And everything else they've got is also SO GOOD.
83,Pho Basil,4 star rating,2/25/2020,"Above average spot. It's extremely convenient for me as far as location goes so I think that's how I know I'll be back but nothing here had me drooling.

Very generous portions and the restaurant inside is clean. They have average ingredients which make for a consistently average tasting food but it's good enough to go back for.

Very casual college-feeling atmosphere if you want to stop in for a quick bite to eat. They are quick to get you food and to turn tables so I've never had to wait long. From now on I'll probably get take-out just because of the location. An important thing to keep in mind, especially if you're not familiar with the area, for either dining in or taking out, is that parking around this area is tough unless you want to pay and arm and a leg to park at the Prudential garages and walk a block or two."
84,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/14/2019,"Great bang for your buck. I got the kao soi and my boyfriend got the duck noodle soup. Both portions were bigggg. 

The kao soi was 10.95 and came with noodles, crispy noodles on top and crispy chicken. The flavor was more mild than my liking and the dry noodle on top weren't crispy which made me sad. That being said the crispy chicken was good and the egg noodles were soft and soaked up all the flavor. 

I tried the duck noodle soup and it was SO GOOD. Probably the best bowl of noodle soup I've ever had. Although you can definitely taste the msg which might be off putting for some people ( but I love msg so maybe that's why it tasted so good)

Overall I don't think you can get better quality food at his price point. Will come again!!

We went at 5 and basically got the last open table so be prepared to wait or go early."
85,Pho Basil,5 star rating,12/12/2021,"This is my favorite thai place in boston. Great service, amazing taste. I just wish they had more seats!"
86,Pho Basil,5 star rating,1/3/2020,"Wow that's the best shumai and noodle soup I've ever had in my life. 

I got the Kao Soi which is this Northern style curry noodle dish and subbed fried tofu for chicken and honestly it was the best thing I've ever eaten in my life. It had all the textures and quantity of broth you're looking for from pho but with the richness of curry. I can't say enough good things about it, like seriously it's the best dish I've ever had in my life.

The shumai was also very delicately crafted and you get eight pieces of deliciousness to share, or not share hehe! 

The boy got drunken noodles and loved it. The portion size was huge and he ate it for two meals. However, at the end of the day he wished he got the curry noodle soup I ordered.

I wish I could eat it again right now."
87,Pho Basil,5 star rating,7/18/2021,"The Kao soi with crispy chicken was amazing! The portion size was huge, was more than sufficient for me. Will definitely visit this place again."
88,Pho Basil,5 star rating,1/6/2020,"My cousin lives in the Back Bay area and recommended we try this place. It's not a very big restaurant, so we did have to wait outside for a little. However, people don't usually linger here after eating their meals, so we didn't wait any longer than 10 minutes. The menu was very basic, but I loved that we could see the several dishes on the menu and also on Yelp. I was craving the drunken noodles, and I'm so glad I got the dish! It does have a little bit of a kick, but it was so good that I continued to eat it so my mouth wouldn't burn so much! The portion size was huge though, so I did take half of it home. I'd definitely come back on my next trip to Boston!"
89,Pho Basil,3 star rating,11/27/2018,"I was in Boston to pick my sister up from school, and she demanded a meal of pho before the drive back. She said Pho Basil was pretty good so we went. It's a small restaurant, and it was pretty packed on Sunday for lunch. We were seated quickly anyway. 

The menu is Asian fusion, not strictly Vietnamese since I definitely saw some Thai options. I ordered the pho sate, which is basically pho with chili oil in the broth. I didn't like the tomato in it, it made the broth more sweet than salty I think. Other than that it was pretty much like any other bowl of pho. Service was pretty slow, our food came out separately instead of all at once, which was annoying since my cousin got her food after everyone else had already finished eating."
0,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,3/4/2022,"While attending the Boston Qualifier for a volleyball tournament, we stumbled upon this place. It opens fairly early (5am, I believe) and closes late (1AM). Our first visit was in the morning, and there were tons of baked goods. Although I did not get to try those, they looked pretty good.

This morning, I ordered an Oat Milk Latte with SF syrup, their green juice, and their Chocolate power ball. I would highly recommend the coffee. The juice was good, but nothing that would standout. Their power balls were quiet tastey!"
1,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"Pressed Café is an exquisite restaurant/cafe, the food here is amazing! My palate was just exploding with flavor- and I ordered vegan kebab sliders that were full of flavor, the new and updated french fries that they added to their menu, and a iced green tea which was made perfectly! I definitely recommend going here and getting a great meal for breakfast, lunch, or even dinner! They also have a bar, an outdoor patio, and of course a lovely dining area!
Pressed is the best! 
I also have to give a shout-out to Sam, he was so sweet taking my order on the register."
2,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/14/2022,"While in Boston for a conference at the Marriott Copley place, I saw this place was highly rated for breakfast, so my partner and I decided to give it a try! When we walked in, we were surprised at how many different meals there were from breakfast burritos to acai bowls to sandwiches and more! I ordered the ""Luck of the Irish"" breakfast burrito, which had corned beef, roasted potatoes, sauerkraut, egg, and a hollandaise sauce, as well as a coffee. After sitting down for just about a minute, the hot coffee comes out, and then after another couple minutes, the piping hot and large breakfast burrito came out as well.

The burrito itself was delish and came with a nice salsa, and I had to take half of hit back to the hotel for later because of the size. I really like the fact that the whole experience is quick and quality, since we already ordered and paid when we came in. I'd definitely recommend this place if over by the Marriott for a stay, and I hope to come again!"
3,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,4/10/2022,"Ordered breakfast delivered to our hotel Sunday morning at 7:30. Order arrived correctly and promptly. (Yay!)
Daughter had nuttella toast which she loved. I had the avo toast with lots of modifications. It was okay, but I can't fault the kitchen because they made the changes I requested. I added turkey sausage and it was dry. Also added egg - wish it could have been poached.
The juice was outstanding. I had the turmeric shot, and it grew hair on my chest, fo sho!"
4,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,9/6/2021,"Huge variety of creative meals, baked goods, juices, smoothies, coffee and alcoholic drinks, what's not to love?! All meals are made with fresh ingredients (for smoothies and juices they use real fruits), breads are fresh, and it's all very reasonably priced, esp for an expensive area like back bay! Also love that they are open so early (5 am) and close late on weekends. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating as well, and staff is very friendly and patient if you have questions about their expansive menu.

So far I've tried:

Rainbow açai bowl- açai made with fresh fruits (no purées or syrups). Very flavorful and filling! 

Crossroads kebab egg n cheese- the vegan kebab tastes like meat! Very flavorful

Mediterranean bagel (got it on a pita)- delicious on both the pita and the bagel! 

The detox- fresh pressed juice- only $9 and comes with plenty of juice! Not too sweet or bitter, very refreshing and comes in the cutest jar you can take home! 

Cappucino- made with George Howell coffee beans and comes with two cute chocolate disks you can put inside your coffee"
5,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,4/6/2022,We were in town for a conference and I ate here for breakfast every morning we were in town. The oatmeal was fantastic! The vegan burrito was also really good!
6,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"Very good option for food for the area. The price is extremely reasonable, serving portions are great, service is fast. There are a lot of food options on the menu (including vegetarian, vegan as well), and the menu is quite extensive. 

Food I've tried: (* = my favorite)
- RED DRAGON POWER BOWL* ($15): interestingly had grilled pineapples in it, came with a side of sriracha. But I really enjoyed the moistness (?) and natural sweetness that the pineapples brought to the dish especially paired with the nuttiness of the grain. (To be fair, I do love pineapples on pizza and you may disagree). The seared tuna was slightly more well done then I would like, but overall good balance of flavors.
- CLAM CHOWDER + PITA ($6 large + $1 pita): exactly how you would expect clam chowder to taste like. Pita was good, quite thick and fluffy. 

Atmosphere:
- Quite busy, especially during weekend hours. It is a seat yourself place, and you order at the counter. The food gets delivered to your table. 
- It may be challenging to find seats during peak times. 

Service:
- Even though it is busy, service is very fast. There is a self serve water station in the corner. 

Overall:
- PRO: great value for price x money, especially for the neighborhood.
- CON: seating can be difficult during peak hours."
7,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,12/3/2021,"Visited this place during conference in Boston. It's kind of hard to find the entrance of the cafe but the environment and the food were amazing! The breakfast burrito was surprising huge and tasted really good! I ordered the shakushuka with veggies, very satisfying with well balanced nutrition! Considering the portion size I would say this is really cheap."
8,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,11/18/2021,"Family was up visiting and they fell in love with this place. We ended up eating breakfast here several days and lunch one day down in Copley. The acai bowls with a dollop of peanut butter was the breakfast of choice and I had the french toast without fruit and pure maple syrup served in a glass jar. 

The restaurant seemed very efficient even during the height of the morning rush. Ordering was easy as they seem to have a button for everything on the POS system. 

Not cheap but good quality!"
9,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"If you're ready for some protein attack in the morning, then I highly recommend the LA steak and egg. It comes with short ribs, caramelized onions, cheese, and eggs. The meat was perfectly marinated, and this comes in VERY generous portion. 

Fair warnings about the portion of the coffee. They came in larger size than other stores."
10,Pressed Cafe,3 star rating,9/20/2021,"Good quality food for fast service. Reminds me of a better version of Potbelly's or Panera bread but with way more options. 

Tried: 1) Halva Tahini Latte 2) Chipotle Chicken Sandwich. The latte wasn't anything special, even though the name implies a sophisticated cultural latte - it tastes like a regular latte with honey and sesame seeds and wasn't anything standout. The sandwich was solid: good portion size, creamy chipotle spread, with a sizable amount of chicken. Bread that it was served on was wholesome and fresh!"
11,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,11/6/2021,Came here for breakfast and they are FAST! Like sat down and our food was already coming out on plates fast. Definitely come here if you want breakfast with a group of friends and don't want to wait!
12,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/17/2022,"Yum yum yum! The restaurant is very big, with free lime/cucumber water. If indoor dining, you will be given a number when you pay, and they will bring the food and drinks to your table. It's conveniently located in The Prudential building, great location to drop by after a day of shopping."
13,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/22/2022,Soooo yummy!  The mango passion fruit smoothie was very good. Staff was very quick and attentive. I will have to try the fruit bowls next time I'm here.
14,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,3/23/2022,One of the best breakfast wraps I've ever had.  Got the egg potato add sausage.  Just wow! The sauce given with it was unreal !  It's a marinara type sauce and adds a delicious taste to the burrito .  Service was great.  I will definitely be trying more from the menu! Coffee is good too!
15,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,9/28/2021,"Great drinks! Excellent food. Got their goat cheese mac 'n cheese which was delicious! Can't wait to try an açaí bowl! 

What makes it even better is that it's connected to Sheraton as its in the Prudential center."
16,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/6/2022,"Two words: (((Pressed Cafe))).  Someone should have bothered to advertise that there was a shop full of Jewish and Israeli specialties right under the damn Pru!  I'd have been coming here for at least a year instead of walking past.

Now, my meal was a bit pricey, but then again, that is because I asked them for the real grilled eggplant.  It's half an eggplant. Grilled.  Costs $8. This is the first and only time I've been able to find this dish made right in the United States.  Stringy and caramelized, NOT spongy!

On from the eggplant.  Is the pita good?  Yes, it is stretchy, fluffy, and chewy pita.  You can open up the pocket, it stretches rather than cracks, so you can put things inside it.  I put the strings of grilled eggplant inside the pita with s'hug, Yemeni cilantro hot sauce.  How was that?  Delicious.  Bready, flavorful on the eggplant, hot-and-cool on the s'hug.  Everything the dish is supposed to be.

What about the shakshuka?  If I'm listing it last there's gotta be something wrong with it, right?  Nope.  It's a spicy tomato sauce with bits of onion and pepper in it, and two well-poached eggs.  Perfect, and with nicely chewy bits of ""feta"" (is it really feta, or is it jibneh?) cheese.  And parsley, of course!  The poached-in eggs could have been just sliiiiightly less cooked, but I like them tougher anyway."
17,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/11/2022,I highly recommend this place for breakfast and lunch! Their breakfast sandwiches are all great! Their salads are delish and they have a great kids menu which is a plus!
18,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"This weekend was my first time ever in Boston, and my dad and I decided to come here on our first day because it was close to our hotel and had good reviews. Now when I tell you I'm tempted to move to Boston just for the challah french toast at Pressed, I'm not exaggerating. Out of the four days we stayed in Boston, we came to eat here on three of them. Everything we tried here was amazing and I loved the authenticity of all of the Israeli foods. On top of that, I have never had faster service at a restaurant in my life. Everything comes out within five minutes of ordering, and it's all fresh and hot from the kitchen. The menu has such a wide selection for every meal and everyone is bound to find something here. I would recommend this place to anyone, so please, if you're in Boston, try out this place. You won't regret it."
19,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,8/13/2021,"This place deserves all of our support as a new addition to Prudential. It's a one stop shop for your entire day's good dreams all with outstanding quality of service. 

Imagine a place you can arrive at sunrise with your books and pen and stay until the moon meets the stars. They have a coffee shop for your early morning, baked goods for early afternoons, and then stay for their paninis and sandwich lunch options. juice and smoothie during the day, dinner with Mediterranean and then a bar with a wide variety of cocktails at night. The variety blows me away and though I only came for dinner, I'd want to come back and 

5/5 for their outstanding atmosphere, service and concept despite being so short on staff!"
20,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,2/21/2022,I had breakfast here a couple days last week when I was in town. I enjoyed the pistachio latte and lavender latte. Also the bakery items were super yummy!
21,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,3/12/2022,"Great drinks, with or without alcohol and a wide assortment of food as well.  Open and well lit, great for lunch, brunch, lite dinner or just a late night snack."
22,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,7/5/2021,"Came in here on a hot day for a smoothie snack. We ordered the fruit cup smoothie and it really did taste exactly like a fruit cup! I could taste the grapes and maybe some melon?

Overall very refreshing and if I lived in the area, I would come back!"
23,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,6/28/2021,"I just wanted to update my review to mention the food! The food is very good. I had a pita among other things today, and it was so much better than the ones you get in the grocery store! I guess they must make them themselves to have them be so fresh.
Also, the way you order at the counter and then they bring the food to you is perfect. That way you still get service, but there is no waiting around for the bill when you're done."
24,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,5/4/2021,"Great addition Back Bay
They have a huge menu option for kids two vegans 

I recommend this place for lunch brunch and after work bites and drinks (i was told djs are there fri and sat nights on the bar side)"
25,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,2/14/2022,Walked here for breakfast and had coffee and the chipotle steak burrito and it was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend if you are in the area. Quick clean and delicious.
26,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/29/2022,We came here for breakfast while visiting for a week on vacation. One of our breakfast sandwiches was made wrong. The manager took it back and made it right. He also brought us a chocolate chip cookie as an apology. We didn't need it but it tasted great and it showed their great service. It was quick and tasted good. It reminded me of a Panera but with more breakfast options to choose from.
27,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/15/2022,"I would live here if they let me. Great, home style fresh food until 10p. I like the salmon blt, eggplant parm quinoa"
28,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,12/9/2021,We went for breakfast. A had the French Breakfast Burrito and I had the American burrito. Both burritos were VERY large and very tasty...A had to take half of hers to go.  We will go back.
29,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,8/1/2021,This place is awesome! It's the nice balance of full service quality food and decor and a quick café. Food is great and so are the drinks. There's even a full service bar!
30,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,3/10/2022,"4 1/2 stars! I had the goat cheese mac 'n' cheese (which comes with spinach, halved cherry tomatoes, and mushrooms) and iced passionfruit green tea. The mac 'n' cheese was great! It was a large portion too. The iced tea was tasty as well."
31,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,2/22/2022,"This is an absolute gem of a restaurant. They opened up ~ a year ago and they have been consistent every time I go there. The menu is extensive. I've tried the breakfast burrito, short rib Mac and Cheese, soups and fresh juices. All excellent."
32,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,5/1/2021,"Press Café is so amazing! For breakfast, lunch, dinner or even just to grab drinks and a snack. They have a ridiculous amount of options in food to serve any and everybody, even those with the strictest dietary restrictions. 

The service is always above and beyond, everybody was so nice there. I cannot speak highly enough about the food because it was so good. I'm going to continue to keep going back there because I have to try every single item on their menu there isn't one single thing that's bad and I would recommend this place to anybody and everybody!!! 

And oh yeah, on the weekends they are open late and their Tapas Menu is so good. I have tired almost everything on it, and the Sliders are a personal favorite, but who are you kidding, you can't go wrong with anything."
33,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,10/29/2021,"Went in for breakfast 3 days in a row while I was staying in the area. Great latte and many many choices for breakfast and lunch. Large seating area.  Great service at the counter. All food items were very good - egg sandwich on English muffin with a real fried egg (not a precooked and reheated egg cube), oatmeal, and French toast. Next time I'm in town I'll try it for lunch and I'd love to check out the bar area."
34,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,9/5/2021,"Nice place. Large menu. So many things I wanted to try but it was late and opted for a kids meal.  Wow! Huge sandwich, bag of  chips and a drink for $9. It was worth it. Awesome staff. Very patient with me and all my questions, as I could have just read the menu."
35,Pressed Cafe,3 star rating,2/15/2022,"I had been to the Pressed Cafe on a trip to Needham and was so excited to find that there was a location back in Boston.  I immediately made an order for the Red Dragon bowl and the Vegan Guacamole stir fried greens bowl.  When the food arrived, I had a few bites of both bowls and was underwhelmed and disappointed since my previous bowl had been so good.  I went back through the order to see what might be missing, and the dressings were completely missing from both of my bowls.  None included on the side, none on the greens.  I ended up making my own and it's *fine* but I was really looking forward to the spicy peanut sauce and the guacamole lemon dressing, I feel like that's what really makes the bowls, and when I'm paying $15-20 for a single bowl I really expect everything to be correct."
36,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,2/13/2022,"The 60+ reviews don't lie, this place is amazing. When I was visiting Boston, I ate here 3 times over the course of 4 days. Each time the food was high quality, not too expensive, and takeout was very fast. I definitely recommend the Pressed Panini! This is a must-visit spot if you're near the Prudential Center."
37,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,4/23/2021,"I love everything about this place. The food is so fresh, unique and delicious.   The staff was super friendly; and the space is beautiful and clean.   Oh not to mention the bar and drinks were so cool and a great combination of flavors. Cant wait to go back!"
38,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,10/10/2021,In Boston for a couple days last week. Stopped by this lovely restaurant twice for breakfast. Friendly accommodating staff. Gluten free choices for wraps and burritos and lots and lots of middle Eastern  inspired recipes. Fresh and delicious and at an excellent price point. Highly recommended !
39,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,11/23/2021,"All I can say is ah-mazing... the vegan veggie ciabatta... RUN, don't walk. Get a side of the vegan bistro and your entire day will be made."
40,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/11/2022,"In a city with overpriced food that typically underdelivers, Pressed is a breath of fresh air. Very affordable and of excellent quality. A perfect stop for a quick bite to eat."
41,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,9/17/2021,Highly recommend. I had the shakshuka and was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. My husband had an açaí bowl and was also very pleased. Fresh and tasty for both. We'll be back!
42,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,10/16/2021,Great local breakfast spot with a varied menu.  Steel cut oats with fruit and almonds was a hit.  Come to NYC please!
43,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,6/17/2021,Couldn't be happier that this place exists. If I'm ever in doubt of where to go in Boston I can just come here or grab take out I know I'll eat something delicious. The staff is friendly and very patient even when I'm being annoying and keep adding random pastries. I've tried at least one item from every category and have not been disappointed with a single thing. This location also has some dishes that remind me of food I always grew up eating. I highly recommend coming to this (or any) location. Their bar is also beautiful and intimate. Will be going tomorrow lol 10/10
44,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,7/26/2021,"I love Pressed! All of the people who work there have been great. GRACE is a stand-out! Anytime of the day, any meal of the day. Snacks, drinks etc. The environment is great for a quick stop or if you want to stay and linger whether it be for work, social, etc. it's just very easy. I've found it to be clean, the food to be fresh, and the staff to be wonderful! I must give a special shout-out to GRACE! This young lady-her energy, her knowledge of the menu, her social skills are what every employer should hope for. She was bright and helpful-and helped to accommodate any requests while offering recommendations. The breakfast sandwiches are delicious. I took another yelper's suggestion and tried on their fresh pita! Definitely try this! We also went back a few days later and had a platter of Eastern Mediterranean delights. This platter included hummus, babaghanoush, feta, beet salad, tomato cucumber salad, and other goodies! Ask for the pita warm. We got an extra side of 5 falafels. Regarding the falafels-I want to gives another chance. They were fairly small and crunchy:"". I don't mind either of those attributes, but am unsure if this batch was over-cooked. They were not bad, but just be prepared for that. We also subbed the vegan sausage on the platter for chicken. It needed up being a whole chicken breast slices. It was very delicious and would definitely try this chicken on a salad. I would definitely try Pressed! I would definitely go again soon!"
45,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,11/28/2021,They had plenty of seating on a Saturday around brunch. Large open space. Great menu. Fresh pressed juice. Delicious. Also has order pickup and app.
46,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,4/25/2021,"A good amount of vegan options, open from 5am till 10pm which for students during this time know cafes have had stringent hours so it saved me a further walk to byChloes last night. The WiFi worked well. I liked what I got; will try more."
47,Pressed Cafe,3 star rating,6/25/2021,"This place is quite expensive at least for the drinks. The strawberry banana was sooooo good. However, the matcha green tea latte's were very bland and could pass for boiled water. Overall, be careful of what you choose to order from this store. Very hit or miss."
48,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"Walked here randomly today and was glad I did. The food was great, the staff was nice, and they prepared my meal very quickly. Very relaxed environment."
49,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,6/19/2021,I love this place! They have great healthy food for all different dietary restrictions. The best part for me is their wide range of non-dairy milk for lattes. Try the Chai Tea Latte with Oat Milk!
50,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,5/30/2021,Great selection of sandwiches and burritos.  Smoothies and coffee were also great.  Perfect spot to have a healthy breakfast or mid morning coffee break.
51,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,7/22/2021,"Great atmosphere, warm feel and some friendly staff. I've only tried two things off of their menu... the chicken and rice soup  and the Chipotle chicken panini, both items were delicious.   I'll be going back again."
52,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,11/25/2021,Sophisticated flavors which i didn't expect in a sandwich! The blue milk was very nice
53,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,5/31/2021,"Great spot for fast food/to-go. I came in here the day we were leaving boston and wanted something quick. Was sceptical of the food taste, but it was good! For a fast food place, it was surprisingly pleasant. Service was fast. People were good and attentive. We got an acai bowl, vegan kebab panini and a bbq chicken panini, all were good."
54,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,11/17/2021,"Our go-to breakfast spot! Food is always so good as are their juices. A little price-y but delicious. Our favorites are the smoked salmon toast, breakfast burritos and the yogurt parfait (the yogurt they use is incredible). They also have a gluten-free wrap available for their breakfast burritos (hoping they offer gluten-free rolls or bagels in the future)! The staff is always friendly and the service is quick despite there usually being a lot of people in the cafe at all times."
55,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,9/29/2021,"Stopped here when we got off the ""hop on hop off trolley"". Reviews were good so we gave it a try. Soooo many options! We had a short rib grilled cheese with mushrooms sandwich. It was delicious. My favorite was the butternut squash soup. That was the Best!"
56,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,10/18/2021,A huge selection of really delicious items.  Everything our group had was excellent.  Service was super nice and helpful as well.  Highly recommend.
57,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,10/17/2021,"This place was fantastic. The food was delicious, the choices immense, and we couldn't appreciate more the assistance with my large family celebrating my mom's birthday weekend. Thank you to Ryan and the bartender (sorry I didn't get your name) for your incredible hospitality. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Just wish there was one in chicago!!"
58,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,7/29/2021,The açaí was so good and the sandwiches tasted great. I enjoyed them both. The cafe is clean and the service is super fast. Would go back again.
59,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,8/30/2021,This is one of my families favorites spots for breakfast or lunch.    Delicious breakfast  and panini sandwiches.  The portions are more than fair and very filing. Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Cafe always seems to be busy yet the orders come out quick.  Will be back and will recommend to friends.

(Though on a warmer day when the gelato place is open... That'll still be my go-to.)"
1,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,12/11/2021,"There is so much going on in Eataly that it is hard to pin down one review to cover it all. I'll skip over the restaurants and talk about the plentiful other options you will find here.

But first - expect crowds! Be surprised if there is not one. Does not matter the time of day, although obviously more people will be there during meal times.

I almost always made a beeline for the specialty meats and cheeses. Wide variety and high quality. You can also buy freshly made pasta or peruse pastas, oils, and chocolates imported from Italy. And do not forget the produce market! Oh and the fish market, meat market, or dry-aged meats hanging in a window. Yea there is a lot.

There is also section dedicated to wines and beer. Again, heavy focus on Italian although you will find a lot of Dogfish Head and Cambridge Brewing as well. Good stuff. My recommendation is No Name. Its pricey but a fantastic barolo.

If you want a quick bite, you can find prepared paninis, focaccia, and gelato. I do not recall trying the gelato but I can certainly vouch for the paninis and focaccia. Big portions and big flavor.

When it comes down to it, Eataly is an experience, one that should be enjoyed often."
2,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,12/8/2021,"There's so much, so many areas, specialties, etc. it's a little hard to rate! It's such a fun place filled with tantalizing treats that tickle the senses. All the fun items, colorful packaging, fully stocked shelves, counters brimming with goodies... it's like Christmas everyday here.

I've tried their coffee, cannoli, tiramisu, pizza, and gotten some grocery items too. I have not been to their restaurants. In terms of their pre-made food, it's surprisingly good. The cannoli was some of the best I've ever had. I think they use a high portion of ricotta, because you really get that delicate flavor without being hit by sugar or just bland cream. The shells stayed marvelously crisp even after several hours. 

The pizza is also delicious. Great crust, generous toppings - the mushroom one was so aromatic and topped with so many juicy mushrooms!

Their coffee is so-so, but I like the ease of ordering at the station because it's separate from everything else and right by the door. The prices are decent, but it's mostly the dark-roast coffee that I'm not a huge fan of. 

Great assortment of charcuterie items, imported snacks, etc. Not a great selection of Italian beverages or sodas surprisingly (I really like this soda called Stappi, it's a bitters soda you can get in Providence on Federal Hill and Eataly doesn't have it.)."
3,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,4/6/2022,Not my favorite spot I would have to say. With all the fresh products around I expected better results. Mussels came out almost cold and had a strong fishy taste. Garlic taste was nonexistent. Waitress was amazing which is the only reasons they are getting two stars will definitely not go back
4,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,12/6/2021,"Loved eating here so much! I found my favorite wine - Etna Bianco from Sicily. It made my day because I already barely find it. 

The fig and burrata was divine and truly what dreams are made of. Got the medium charcuterie board as well. 

The day I went, there was a wine tasting! Mind blowing at it was so much fun."
5,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,2/18/2022,"Came on a Friday night with a reservation. It was pretty busy! We were seated within five minutes of our reservation. After we ordered, our food came out very quickly. They didn't grate the parmesan onto the pasta in front of us , it was already there. When we asked for more cheese they brought us some in a little cup which was nice. The waitress was very kind and attentive. The burrata and prosciutto was very good quality. And the bolognese was excellent; there was so much of it! Definitely didn't go hungry that night. All together it was a nice experience."
6,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,1/16/2022,"I have to admit that I am not sure what I think about this place.  On one hand, I am obsessed with grocery stores, markets and beautiful ingredients.  This place has all of that in spades.  The shelves are packed with hard to find, unique or exquisite meat, cheese, pasta, etc.  On the other hand, there is something sterile and gentrified about buying these beautiful ingredients in an overpriced shopping center in the Prudential.      I found myself feeling guilty that I did not make the walk over to the North End and spend my money at a family grocer.  It was a bitterly cold day so I will excuse myself this time, but I will not make the same mistake again."
7,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,4/8/2022,"Super busy spot that originated in New York City.  This gets VERY busy.   Crowded and packed, in fact.  There is a lot going on here.  A lot to see and a lot to eat.  There's so much going on that it's hard to even review this place.  Let's just say if you want Italian Groceries of any kind, this is your place.  Fresh and packaged dry pastas, grand and go lunch, vinegars, olive oils, packaged goods imported from Italy and the like.  Gelatos and pastries as well. It's all here.  Keep in mind it is VERY expensive."
8,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,9/30/2021,"Eataly in Boston used to be my go-to spot after work to wait out the traffic with a drink or two along with their delicious Italian plates! It's a huge marketplace with a dedicated area for cheese, meats, seafood, pantry items, and sweets. You can dine here as well, indoors at the bar or tables, it's a first come first serve situation. Just be prepared for a wait during prime lunch or dinner time. And outdoors, reservations can be made through OpenTable. Oh, and parking, it's Back Bay, if you can find street kiosk pay to park, great, if not, they validate parking at the Guest Relation booth with proof of $10 purchase, up to 4hrs, $15, 4-5, $20, after 5hrs, $42 at Prudential Center Garage.

Burrata- I had so many variations of their burrata. Mainly drizzled with one of their infused oil, with tomato, fig, or anchovies. Love it!
Taglieri Piccolo (Chef's selection of 3 types of meat 3 kinds of cheese)- Any of their cured meats and cheeses are fantastic.
Oysters- It wasn't fresh and both my gf and I were sick after trying their oysters. We haven't ordered it from here since then.
Old Fashioned- Amazing.
Frose- Frozen rose, this was the spot to go for it in the summer!

Overall Service: Depending on where you go, service varies in Eataly. In the grocery sections, everyone has been helpful. The dining side can be a hit or miss depending on how chaotically busy they are, but for the most part, they have been pleasant. Our bartender Lou was fun and upbeat, one of the reasons why we used to like this spot so much, but since then he's moved on and so have we. I would still recommend this place!"
9,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,11/5/2021,"Eataly has everything you need to please the Italian in your life or to plan and execute the perfect Italian meal in a one-stop shop (literally). From fresh produce to the butcher shop to the seafood counter to the beer and wine shop, Eataly has not only the fresh items covered but also imported packaged food and oils to ensure your pantry is fully stocked. 

I work in the Pru and Eataly has become my preferred grocery and meat shop for the items that matter. If you can't find it there, it probably can't be found in Boston!"
10,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,8/18/2021,"Eataly never disappoints. If you are looking for authentic Italian flavors this is the spot for you. My sister's friends from Rome, who have since moved to Boston say Eataly is the only Italian restaurant in Boston that reminds them of home. The ravioli is to die for and the cannolis are magnificent. I'm the last person you would find outside of Mike's pastries or Modern bakery for cannolis, mainly because it's just not my go to dessert. However, Eataly's mini cannolis are something else. I would vote them the best ones in Boston. The ricotta is so luscious and creamy!
 
Also, please note that you can get validated parking if you park in Prudential. Save your money, don't waste $20 to park. Instead use it towards a nice meal with your friends and family!"
11,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,3/10/2022,"Very reasonable experience here at La Pizza/Pasta for restaurant week in Boston. Got an appetizer and main for 19$/person - all the apps and half of the main options were vegetarian. We got the cacio e Pepe and margarita pizza for mains - basic but delicious. Pizza feels neopolitan style with a soft thin crust so if you like to be able to pick up a piece and have it hold it's own,  this probably isn't for you. Cacio e Pepe was great, al dente with a good bite and not too heavy. Not sure what full prices are like, but restaurant week specials were definitely worth it for a nice dinner out."
12,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,11/22/2021,"Whether you are looking for a bite to eat or cooking supplies, Eataly Boston is a spot worth checking out. There are fast-casual and sit-down restaurant options inside of this very large Italian-focused grocery. There is a deep selection of wines and food to enjoy or take home as well as some pre-prepared items. The environment is very lively and unique and carries a fabulous selection of everything from fresh produce to cheeses and pastries. In addition, there are a number of kitchen implements and pantry supplies to be found here. Even if you are just wandering and looking for ideas, you can definitely burn quite a bit of time here.

I enjoyed the experience and look forward to a second visit. Looking forward to my visit when I return to Back Bay!"
13,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,6/14/2021,"This mega market in the middle of Back Bay is amazing.   I have already been to the Eataly in NYC and Chicago....and this one has been done very well.   The two main entrances are either through the Prudential Center or by coming through their Patio restaurant on Boylston. 

Eataly delivers.  It has a great combination of market, restaurant, grocery story, coffee shop, candy shop, gelato place, etc.   You can get a whole fresh fish, a side of ham, or a piece of Italian candy....and...anything in between.   In their wine shop you can get a bottle for about $15-20 upwards to the Thousands !!!!   Your pick......

There are several restaurants inside this complex.   Terra is upstairs with a nice patio and skylight dining area.   The Pizza and Pasta place is kind of in the middle of the entire store and the Patio is outside.   There are also many different areas where you can get prepared foods.    The quality of the goods here is amazing, so the prices reflect that.  Some of the stuff is very high end, but it depends on what you want and what you are looking for.

Check it out next time in Back Bay."
14,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,11/26/2021,"This is pretty much like all the other Eataly's I been to. It's seems smaller than the one in NYC and Chicago.  The food was delicious. It's all fresh and has quality ingredients. Had a Margarita pizza and gelato. The pizza had a nice crust , mild flavor, and a light fresh mozzarella.  The gelato was rich in the dark chocolate , and was deep in flavor.  If it was bigger, I would of given it 5 stars."
15,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,7/4/2021,"Hard to navigate the space when lots of folks are there. 
We ate in the pasta/pizza restaurant. Really good. Fresh flavors on our ravioli and calzone. 
Server was super nice. 
It was loud but also the store part was packed. 
Well def go back."
16,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,6/8/2021,"This review is for Il Patio di Eataly

Pretty enjoyable dining experience on the beautiful patio at eataly. Love the decor and the set up but they were really understaffed which affected our experience. We had to wait to be seated even with a reservation and it took over an hour for our food to arrive and it wasn't even hot. I got the vongole and my friends got the ravioli, pappardelle, and the bolognese all of which they seemed to enjoy. My pasta also felt undercooked. It all still was delicious and love the ambiance , but for the prices, you expect the quality of food and service to be a bit better.

Follow me on ig for more recs @sophiaeaats!"
17,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"For appetizer we started with the prosciutto, which was super delicious and just enough to wet our appetite for two people. I got the bucatini, which comes with guanciale in pecorino romano cheese. This was truly one of the best pastas I've had. The guanciale was crispy and not too greasy, and the sauce was just divine. For wine, I highly  recommend the opera lambrusco. It's a red sparkling, and I loved it so much I bought a bottle to bring home with me."
18,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,9/29/2021,"I came here to grab a quick snack and I wasn't very impressed. I wanted to try a couple pastries and a drink so I ordered the croissant, espresso cake and hot chocolate. 

Everything was bland and didn't have much flavoring. The hot chocolate also wasn't plugged in when I ordered and was sitting there for a while so it tasted very weird. 

The marketplace however is very nice and has a lot of different things to purchase"
19,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,1/31/2021,"Buongiorno!

My son moved to Boston and tells me there is a Eataly that is just as good as NYC. I say don't be ridiculous. However! We're going out to dinner, I suggest we stop there and bring home some pastry. 

Walking to the location, its inside a mall? We take the escalator up and walk into the Italian Wizard of Oz. 

Meats, Cheeses, Pastries, Gelato, Chocolates, freshly made Pastas and Breads Did I just describe heaven? I asked a worker do they have any Calabrian chili paste, he points to a small grocery area, where they had none.

We walk over to the pastry section. How could you choose? You want everything on display. There are four of us, my wife sees a sign: 8 items for $20 dollars. It made it easy for us to choose. I'm choosing Tiramisu, its my favorite and Eataly makes it very well. The dusting of cocoa powder on top, mmm... I also grabbed a loaf of bread to bring back to Long Island. 

First time here and I'm very impressed. If your from New York City and want a taste of home, come to Eataly."
20,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,1/24/2021,"Yes, it's probably overpriced, but there's so much going on here that it has to be seen to be appreciated. It's almost as extensive as its New York counterpart, with countless stands, cases, bars, and restaurants with just about anything Italian that you could imagine, whether fresh meats, seafood, antipasti, pastries, gelati, cheese, wine, espressi, and, of course, freshly made pasta and pizze. Some of the counters have active kitchens behind them where you can observe the staff at work from behind large, clear windows - literally constant, real-time cooking demonstration. On that note, they offer in-person cooking classes (in normal times).

This Boston outpost is tailored to the abundance of fresh, local seafood that's available here in New England. If you enter from its dedicated street-level entrance here at Prudential Center (a few steps west of the main entrance/escalators to the mall), you'll be greeted with huge displays along the walls emphasizing Eataly's local sourcing. You then ascend a flight of escalators to the main market hall. Boston foodies will appreciate that noted local restaurateur Barbara Lynch, of Menton and Sportello fame, is one of Eataly's key collaborators.

Even if many things are out of your price range, this is still a huge, beautiful venue to peruse. It really puts the Prudential Center shops on the map as a worthy stand-alone destination - not just the declasse sibling to the more upscale Copley Place shops a footbridge away."
21,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,3/21/2022,"The ambiance was lovely but unfortunately the food was not worth the cost. Our table got the avocado toast, polenta, and brioche French toast.

The poached eggs were all cooked differently. Our table had three in total: one was undercooked to the point of the whites being runny, the next was over cooked like a hard boiled egg, and the last one was cooked correctly. 

The polenta was not well seasoned and there was no salt and pepper on the table for us to personally adjust. Other than the seasoning and the egg, the polenta was tasty and was a decent portion size. The avocado toast also tasted good besides the poached eggs and was a decent serving size. 

The French toast was only one and a half pieces and came with approximately three blueberries and less than one strawberry. Since this French toast was such a small meal, we requested a side of eggs which was not accommodated despite us being willing to pay for it. I think Terra at Eataly could be a cute spot to grab a drink, but the food was not worth it."
22,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,6/27/2021,"Two slices of prosciutto and 4 pieces of gnoccho fritto. 20 dollars robbed. This doesnt hold a candle to that closed Babbo at seaport which funny enough is owned by the same company. 

Pasta dish was a full hand slap to every italian. Zero, absolutely zero taste. My high school cafeteria line chefs had at least courtesy to dash their pasta with some flavor. Almost had to tell the waiter to take it back but was thankful he at least screwed up and brought us one plate instead of the other so I could avoid sending both back. I let it slide.

If you're a tourist or have never tasted what good italian food really is, this is your spot. Just an embarrassment all around."
23,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,2/20/2022,I love this place. My favorite thing to do when I've either experienced a really bad thing or really good thing (Breakup? Birthday? Eately.) I always go to la pizza la pasta and get pizza and a fancy soda. Then I explore and get some kind of dessert or chocolate. So fun.
24,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,5/12/2021,"Mostly come here for fresh fish (red snapper. Cod. Yum!) and groceries and give half my pay check to them. 

Highly recommend the fresh pasta

Omg the truffle sauce or truffle cream is to die for- pair it with their beet root gnocchi:)

Thank you eataly you make weeknight dinners amazing"
25,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,2/28/2022,The food  is outstanding. All of it. BUT the music is unbelievably loud. I was with a friend at 11:30 am trying shop. I felt like I was in a bad nightclub. I wanted to eat lunch but we bagged it. We couldn't even talk above the awful music. How about this? How about some nice classical music at a decibel level that allows conversation without yelling?
26,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,12/6/2021,"I love this place. Love taking my time here looking at all the wonderful products. And eating here is another experience that is not to be missed. But this review is for the wine store portion of the store. Eric is ahem. He is knowledgeable and helpful. He really wants to know what you're looking for and doesn't pick the most expensive item necessarily... he makes a few suggestions because he wants you to be satisfied with your purchase. Eric is also great at making suggestions when you don't really know what you're looking for. He has been a real help and kind and professional. I like the selection in this shop and the location makes it easy for a one stop shop for wine, grocery, and prepared foods."
27,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,11/23/2020,"Such an amazingggg find! Tucked inside Copley Place, this little Italian eatery was full of fresh and flavorful Italian cuisine! It is set up like a marketplace on the outsides, with a fresh produce section in the middle and a restaurant. It's everything your dream of in a cute market! 

The price point was a little high but expected for the quality. I wish I could have gotten so much more but there is always a next time!"
28,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,4/14/2021,I've never seen this kind of establishment before but what a great concept...a little grocery store selling fresh produce with healthy fast food diners in the middle of the market.  Perfect for mall shoppers.  Just here to buy waters and cold pressed juices to take to the hotel.  Very friendly staff.
29,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,12/24/2021,We would probably give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for an unpleasant hostess... but it turned out to be a benefit because we ended up going to another restaurant in Eataly because of her and it was GREAT! The waiters were so friendly and though we had to wait they were helping me find a seat as quickly as possible. The food exceeded our expectations! Let me tell you about this mozzarella - SO good - we could eat 3 more of these delicious balls. The pasta was really good too as well as the proscuitto! Such a fun and cute atmosphere - will definitely be back!!
30,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,3/29/2022,The restaurant was extremely disappointing- the food reminded us of fast food - the store is intriguing but everything is overpriced
31,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,11/2/2021,"My husband and I were excited to try out Eataly during their $25 deal for an appetizer and entree earlier, so we had to stop by! The atmosphere was nice and the customer service was great as they helped us get seated quickly. Everything sounded really great, including the wine choices. We ordered the sliced raw fish of the day (crude del giorno) and mushroom pasta (tagliatelle al ragu di funghi) from the $25 deal menu, then also ordered the truffle egg yolk pasta (tajarin con tartufo nero) and the 18-month prosciutto. Out of everything we ordered, we mostly enjoyed the prosciutto. I must say, the pastas were a bit mediocre and not what we expected. We love truffle and we had truffle egg yolk pasta before from other places, but the truffle was way too subtle, barely noticeable, in this pasta. I enjoyed the mushroom pasta more. I would say if I'm in the mood for some Italian dishes, I would much rather go to North End for some finer options."
32,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,5/3/2021,Geez this is an Italian foodie heaven. Wish they would open one in Portland. I could have spent an hour just drooling over the prosciutto selection. We needed a break from our walking tour of Boston and got some beverages and the pesto pizza at the cafe. The Napoli style pizza crust was excellent. I was totally re-energized for our 2 mile walk home. Check it out.
33,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,4/2/2021,"Love me some Eataly. Want pizza? They got it. Pasta? That too. Tiramisu, cannolis, gelato, espresso? Yup. Oh, and a whole grocery shop with additional restaurants enclosed? Indeed. 

Eataly is a great place to stop in for lunch, bring guests through, or shmy around on a rainy day as it's basically an indoor market. The food is always fresh and delicious, but the prices are steep, super crowded and difficult to navigate, and seating is very limited. 

From taste alone? Fantastic. My orders:
- the foccaccia style pizzas! Pictured is the tomato mozzarella (caprese I think!) 
- panini with fresh mozzarella and bacon (instead of prosciutto)
- build you own salad
- straciatella gelato"
34,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,9/7/2020,"This review is for my DoorDash delivery experience with eataly. I've had much better experiences visiting in person!

Ordered a salsiciotta pizza - sausage mushroom and basil. It showed up with scant toppings, was super cold, and wasn't even sliced??? It came in the box that people usually use to serve pizza that you eat immediately out of this box so I found this to be very puzzling.... 

Sliced it on my own and then heated it up in a pan with the lid on so I could revive the crust and steam the toppings and cheese. Weird pizza experience. 

Pizza was $19 and personal size.

Probably would not order this ever again because of lack of ready-to-eat prep and portion to price ratio. Stick to elsewhere for your pizza. Glad I got this off a DoorDash promo and didn't pay for most of it... I'll give 2 stars instead of 1 bc the pizza was good after heating it up and slicing it."
35,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,8/30/2021,"Such a great spot in prudential center.they sell desserts, wine, cheese, meat and lots lots of imported snacks. U can also choose to sit down and order hot food such as pizza from them.I absolutely love places like this because they are so convenient and they offer A LOT OF options."
36,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,10/5/2021,"Great place And great people!!! The food is excellent...
Our bartender Ronnie was simply the best, very Knowledgeable, fun and with a great Sense of humor. 
I will definitely be back with friends and family. 
Highly recommended!"
37,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,9/14/2021,I've come here a handful of times with friends. They offer a decent selection of gelatos and sorbets. The workers are usually friendly but other times not. Prices are fair considering being in Prudential Center. Not anything crazy but would come if in the area.
38,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,9/11/2021,"Not sure how many times I have passed by this place ,which used to be the food court back in the day. I decided to go in to check it out & it is big, like holy hell there is so much going on. There is an entire restaurant inside as well as a market for you to shop. Who would have guessed that there is so much going on inside w/ the prepared foods, gelato, pastries, cheeses, etc. So yeah this place has so much going on that it's always busy at all times. That is the hardest to deal w/ during a pandemic. So whatever you may be in the mood for- snack, beverage, pizza, dessert, they have it. You will find items here that you will never fond in a regular supermarket. I would say the best find ever was the vegan chocolate hazelnut spread made w/out palm oil. So brace yourself for all the congestion of people but the goodies are worth it."
39,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,10/12/2020,"This review is solely for Terra. Unfortunately, while the rooftop is beautiful, there are no views and it gets pretty cold. Their service is really fantastic and our waiter came to let us know when he went on a break and introduced us to the new waiter that would be filling in. 

Our food was delicious and so were our drinks. However, we prob won't order the mushroom appetizer again. You get 4 rock solid mushrooms that don't have much flavor. The pasta and scallops were incredible. 

They also have season inspired drinks if you're not into wine. Their wine is incredible however, priced higher than their specialty cocktails."
40,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,7/19/2021,"Perfect, there is nearly too much to love and there is plenty to take home be it in the car, or on the plane. It's expensive but it's such a great, curated collection of Italian love, that you just have to LOVE IT. I haven't tried every dining option preferring to grocery shop for a later picnic or the pantry."
41,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,1/14/2022,"I've heard so many wonderful things about Eataly, so I was excited to finally get to experience it in Boston. Reservations for 2 on Friday night were easy, staff was accommodating, wine list was lovely with broad choices and good descriptions, food was delicious! It's black truffle season with many options to include with meal. Bread and olive oil was hearty, but we added the bruschetta and calamari as starters! Barely made it through the pasta to save room for dessert. Open floor plan in the middle of all of the Eataly shopping areas in the peak of Omicron, but it was fun and lively and felt safe!"
42,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,3/25/2021,"Food: 3/5 but I really like the concept of Eataly and the fact that there are so many offerings to try from!

I'd recommend going there for their cheese & meat selection- seems like a great place to making your own charcuterie & cheese board.

The pizza is nothing amazing, but it is pretty good.  Not warm though.  The Limoncello was enjoyable."
43,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,3/4/2021,"I've only gotten take out so I can't speak on anything but that. I will update when I visit in person.

This is a good spot for cheat day food. 
I've had the agnolotti di coniglio, tiramisu della nonna, patate fritte, profiterole al caramello salato, cotoletta Alla Milanese (and a bottled limonata)

The desserts were to die for! So flavorful, not too sweet and the right amount of fat content on the tongue. (Again, it is a cheat day).

The Milanese cutlet was dry and disappointing. Having spent lots of time being Italian mothered where I learned to love this dish, I can give you an address to a place where you can get East Boston's (and maybe Boston's) best Milanese cutlet. I guess you can't beat home cooking. While you're in East Boston, you might want to pop by Rino's. I assure that you won't be disappointed with the food. The parking situation is a whole other story. 

The agnolotti di coniglio was edible but lacking in much craved flavor and texture. This may be because it was cold and I warmed it up in the microwave. This might have been more palatable if it was eaten when freshly cooked. 

I wish restaurants would consider what travels well and heats up well in microwaves (because I know I'm ordering in to avoid cooking and dirty dishes) in planning their delivery menus."
44,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,12/8/2021,"Great merchandise, food samples, Italian food..overall great to walk thru albeit slightly pricy.

Wonderful experiences here, always."
45,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,12/7/2020,"Can't wait to return for another proper visit after Covid. It's truly an experience. Great place to bring tourists that are visiting and you can enjoy as well. Wine tastings and lots of sampler stuff. 

Before you eat make sure that you walk through the entire store. There are tons of options for food and drink here. Also great options of food you can take home and hard to find Italian items.  Cheeses, wines, cookies, cured meats, freshly prepared pasta, sauces, and even flour for baking and making your pasta at home. Don't forget the coffee."
46,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,10/4/2021,"Had an amazing meal and the best service  in EATALY Boston !   From the hostess to the manager. We sat at the bar and Ronnie was our waiter !  He created  an amazing experience for my husband and I ! Very knowledgeable, fun and entertaining.  
Will definitely return on my next trip to Boston.!

Love from NYC"
47,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,10/3/2021,"Really. After a nice meal with friends. Lovely service and a $350 check - the people who stamp the parking rudely demanded to see the receipt which had been left at the table and
Initially refused to validate my parking. Sunday night. Not full restaurant. $350 check and I had to prove I'd eaten in the restaurant to get a parking validation. Rude. Snippy and uncalled for. Bad form."
48,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,9/15/2021,I have been to Eataly many times. It's one favorite places to eat at Backbay. They serve amazing pizzas and pastas. But my favorite is the cannoli. It is the best cannoli you can get in Backbay area. Definitely recommend this place to satiate your Italian craving.
49,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,12/22/2020,"Found this place within the mall. I was roaming around and I figured let me go in here to check this place out. I felt like I was in Italy. With so many different things to purchase. They had a station where you can purchase fresh pasta and have it made fresh. They also have several other sections such as a dessert section, pizza, and also cheese. This is just a few that they include however, there are more to choose from. One aspect that I like about this place is you can get everything fresh. I also love how they had a large variety of cooking oils. I would definitely make this apart of my list for my next visit to Boston!  I purchased fresh pasta with truffle oil and cheese. I also had fresh cannolis made for me. Great place!"
50,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,6/15/2020,"I love walking around here, it's great to look at the constantly changing food items and household goods (pasta shaped oven mitts whaat!), sip some wine, have some espresso, and perhaps have a lazy lunch. The store is extremely well decorating and changes with the seasons. There are so many perfect gift ideas, such as panettone around winter, delicious olive oil year round, wine of course, and various cute kitchen items. 

The restaurants are all amazing! I absolutely adore Terra for a nice long dinner with family, and the patio for a great aperetivo hour or a date with spritzes and small plates. The tiramisu is SO GOOD!! Special kudos goes out for all the care taken during the pandemic- everything is sparkling clean, all staff wearing masks, and all tables (outdoors of course) 6 feet apart and with digital menus."
51,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,1/11/2022,I love this place. I feel like I'm in Little Italy. I love their large selection of cheese and crackers.
52,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,1/2/2021,"I do like Eataly for fun little gifts, and it's a great place to take tourists. Being from the West Coast, Eataly is something I have never heard of before, so it has always been kind of a ""special"" place to go for me. So, it is nice to go to for speciality items like unique pasta, sauces, treats, etc., but I find it rather unorganized. It's a bit like a maze inside, and hard to see what your options are for shopping if you aren't familiar with the layout of the market. It's also slightly cramped. I wish they had more local items, but I have to give them props for labeling New England specialty products with a big ""LOCAL"" tag. 

All in all, I think it's worth going to if you've never been before or if you're planning to make an Italian dinner, you may find something you like!"
53,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,11/12/2021,"I went to eataly with some friends for a happy hour and it was so much fun! They have a variety of wines and cocktails and we split a charcuterie board. They also have a large selection of meats, cheeses, wines, pastas, desserts, and basically everything you could want!"
54,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,1/27/2022,Very rude staff. They were not understanding at all to my disabled husband. It was extremely embarrassing and felt uncomfortable with how we were treated. Please don't support this business if you respect everyone should be treated the same.
55,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,8/8/2021,"My friend and I recently visited Il Patio at Eataly before a concert at Fenway Park. It was the perfect night to sit outside and enjoy the weather! We decided to split Fritto Misto Di Mare and Pizza Alla Parmigiana. The first dish was a mix of calamari, shrimp, and clams, which were all tasty! The one downside to this dish was that more than half the crate was filled with potato chips and there didn't seem to be too many shrimp and clams. The pizza was delicious. It reminded me of a pizza I once had in Capri, Italy. It definitely had an authentic Italian taste! We will definitely be back."
56,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,10/19/2021,Horrible restaurant. The food is disgusting & the service is deplorable. I've had better Ragu that taste better than this restaurant. Plus the staff and employees are very racist and only cater the to white people. People please avoid this place at all cost.
57,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"Eataly is a very lively place. The servers are nice, courteous, and friendly, and the Butternut squash soup tastes great. On my first night in Boston, after a long flight from LA, I was looking for warm soup to help me get rid of my exhaustion. Those folks at Eataly are amazing."
58,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,12/19/2021,"This is about the grocery shopping experience. We still love food from their restaurants. We do grocery shopping in Eataly but in the recent months, their quality control is not in place. They were selling expired baby arugula, packaged mortadella was discolored, and a packaged cheese that we buy every other week (freshly cut over the counter was fine though) labeled to be good for months had molds all over when we opened after a few days we got. The most disappointing experience was from the meat section. We got chicken sausages and found out they were spoiled! This is not acceptable, especially their price is exorbitantly high for everything. Very disappointing."
59,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,3/22/2022,"Came in here with my white friend and as she was getting pizza to go, I took a quick sip of my hot tea and a worker from a completely different section came over and yelled at me like I was a dog or something saying I'm not suppose to eat or drink in there because I needed to keep my mask. Didn't make sense to me as I saw another non POC customer across the room from me without a mask on one of there workers in the back also didn't have their mask on. This was my first time ever coming into this overpriced establishment and I would never return. My friend, whom I mentioned is a white woman even told me that the worker didn't need to bark at me like how she did and give me so much attitude even after I apologized and said I was unaware of the rules because I see others not following them in the store and she just rolled her eyes at me and walked off. Very rude and disturbing, I didn't purchase anything from there due to how I was treated."
60,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,8/19/2020,"I get it, it's Covid times.  But that's not an excuse for really bad service.  We had to ask three different people for peppers.  Our food was cold by the time we got it.  We couldn't get any extra silver to serve with.  Every single thing was a struggle here.  The dinner was good but we had to pile up our appetizer plates and move them to the side so we had room for our dinner plates because no one picked them up.  It was a mess all around."
61,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,12/3/2021,"Food was good. Service was sufficient but pleasant. Unfortunately, small portions and well overpriced. Water salad and a small pasta dish was $50 with tip. In Italy a portion of pasta this size is an appetizer."
62,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,10/17/2021,"We stopped at Eataly for a late lunch Saturday afternoon and ordered the fixed price, 2 course meal. Appetizers / salads arrived after a short wait. One pasta entree arrived after a longer wait, and we waited at least another 30min for two chicken entrees. The wait staff were very apologetic and the manager offered a dessert, but at that point, we just wanted to leave.

However, the salads, pasta, and chicken dishes were very good. Recommend not opting for the black truffle surcharge: there was no truffle fragrance presumably from fungi older than 2wks or so.

The specialty markets in Eataly are impressive: the butcher has the best dry-aged steaks, the cheese and salami selections are amazing, with both US and imported options."
63,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,5/14/2021,"So darn good! Granted the wait to eat was a little longer than preferred, even with a reservation, but it was so worth it. The food is fantastic and we dined on fresh pasta and veal and pizza. After we were done we went and spent way too much money in the actual store as we stocked up on past and cheeses for home. It was amazing.  The place was jamming with people and we were so happy to leave full and looking forward to more good food at home. Love this area of Boston as well and it is perfect."
64,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,11/6/2021,"My friends and I got their ready made foods and it was honestly really really horrible.
I got lasagna and it wasn't even lasagna??
So normally it's sheets of pasta with layers of stuff right?, but this was a ton of strips of pasta formed together to mimic lasagna?? It was very funny honestly lmao.
 also it was just horribly bland and a bad mushy texture 
My friends couldn't even finish their food and man this would be tolerable if it was some other grocery store but this was hella expensive and everything else about the place made it seem that this would be good quality but womp womp my friends and I took that L 

Im sure their actually food stands are nice (hopefully) but they were all closed so we didn't try anything from there"
65,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,8/15/2020,Large Italian themed market & restaurant center! Markets mostly overpriced specialty food! But that's what specialty foods are! Just tried the pizza restaurant. Food was above average. Gillato stand was closed which was a downer.
66,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,10/5/2021,"My wife and I headed out to Eataly this past Saturday night and had some of the most amazing pizza we've eaten in quite a while.
Our night was topped off when we decided to sit at the bar for some after dinner drinks....not only were the cocktails sensational but our bartender, Ron, had us in stitches the whole time we were there. What a character!
Definitely one of Boston's best. Hands down.
Made our night that much more memorable!!"
67,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,10/3/2021,We had a great time at Pizzaria with our server Maria who helped us pick very tasty drinks!
68,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,11/11/2019,"High class Italian eating and shopping, and this was quite the treat. 

Little did I know they have a location in other big cities, but this is not Olive Garden I am talking about here, so I can write about this one and not feel guilty about it. 

The food here is not cheap, but getting the $18 two course meal really paid off. It comes with an unlimited amount of bread, which tastes fresh and delicious. The pasta is also superb (I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli with the beef carpaccio). Yes the plates are a bit on the small side (but not too small), but the experience and smells that you go through when you come in just take you to another level. It took me a lot of restraint not to buy the whole store because I would have if I had the strength, money, and power to do so!

It is located right inside the Prudential Center, a high class mall reminiscent of Tyson's II in DC. But this one is better laid out and has less foreigners rummaging through to find the perfect deals. 

I totally recommend coming to this shop/restaurant and getting yourself a hearty dinner. This is what Back Bay is all about, this, right outside downtown! Get on the Orange Line and get your butt out here, now!"
69,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,7/23/2020,"We were wandering around Boston and in a pasta kind of mood. Initially, we were just browsing because we were thinking of buying the ingredients for a pasta dinner but then I noticed they had a nice restaurant set up and some great sounding pizzas so we wandered over and the host got us a table.

My one gripe is their QR code menu refused to work. I kept trying and it never opened. Even the waiter helped with no luck. Eventually, after trying probably 5 times, he offered us paper menus. Once we said it wasn't working I feel that the menus should have been offered. 

The menu isn't huge but has some really cool sounding items. We ended up going with a pizza with sweet sausage and mushrooms. Word of warning - the pizza is delicious but not huge. If you're really hungry it might make sense to order an app or salad because between the two of us we walked away loving it but still hungry. The bread they gave us before the meal was just so so and the dipping sauce didn't taste mixed correctly so I didn't have more than a bite. The water they gave in the bottle was warm - I think they probably want you to order sparkling and that's by design. Our waiter never checked to see if we wanted more water (we did) and kind of just threw the bill when we were done. Gave me the impression that since we weren't ordering a lot or alcoholic drinks we weren't as valued which I see sometimes and really dislike. For comparison, the table of young girls near us had a ton of drinks and food and he went over to them at least 7 times while we ate and never saw him again. 

Four stars for the food but the service really was pretty lacking. Not sure we'd eat in again here."
70,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,1/26/2022,"Excellent food, great atmosphere, selection superb, convenient parking with discount validation.  Many options, so call ahead or look on website to investigate choices.  It makes for a fun evening."
71,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,10/5/2021,"I don't remember what I ate, I was so busy trying to get settled coming from out of town. I had a great drink and wonderful conversation with Ron. He is a keeper."
72,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,7/20/2021,"i want to live in eataly. 

the pizzas we ordered were amazing and i spent more time looking at everyone else's food and salivating than looking at my own mother. every night since, i've dreamt of these two delicious pizzas and how to return for another meal. 

the shopping and grocery area looked amazing- all of the fresh pastas and meat made me want to move to boston for that alone. 

papa john's has been forever ruined thanks to this pizza."
73,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,6/25/2019,"What a great accident to run across Eataly in the Prudential Center. The timing was perfect too since my daughter and I were starved after touring. 

One may want to call this the Prudential Center food court. However, that would not serve it justice since it so much more and has an identity that's truly Boston. This is a destination for locals and tourist alike and not what I first would have thought being a tourist trap.  

Expect busy especially during lunch rush with all the area offices. There are stations within the Eataly such as coffee, pizza and ice-cream. But there's so much more like the best deli in probably the entire Boston metro area tucked in back. Even houseware items. In the center is an upscale sit down Italian. The dishes I observed on tables looked marvelous. 

My daughter and I had slices of pizza from an eye popping assortment of over probably 10 varieties.  I got a slice that resembled a salad, my daughter a pepperoni. Both scrumptious! The staff was friendly. Expect higher end on the cost, this ain't no Sbarro's Pizza. 

Then we moved onto ice-cream. They will provide samples of anything you like. I got a caramel variety, my daughter too! The staff smiled and was friendly. It was a bit awkward that a male manager scolded a staff in front of us for not wearing a hair net.

This is distinctly a Boston creation and a destination worthy of checking out when in the area."
74,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,7/14/2021,"Had two ten-dollar sandwiches in our group, the caprese and the roasted chicken. Neither were any better than at a gas station, very little flavor. No detectable arugula flavor in the ""arugula pesto"" just greasy. They sure do know how to make a menu SOUND appetizing though, I'll give them that. Crammed tight enough in the cafeteria style seating that mine at least picked up a little flavor from the heavily perfumed woman behind me. Not really what I was looking for though. Will not be back, what a waste of prime real estate. Their grocery store may be good but their food is sub-par."
75,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,4/8/2021,Tried the Margherita Pizza and it instantly took me back to my eurotrip. 11/10 would recommend and will be coming back to try others
76,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,6/29/2021,So overpriced! We won't because my kids wanted some pasta. Not the same experience as NYC. Portions were tiny yet so expensive. Quality of food is good but we're not at a fancy restaurant.
77,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,8/26/2021,Food was bland and service substandard. The seem to have a good variety of products tho. Over priced.
78,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,8/15/2019,"Eataly encompasses the whole market that includes a bunch of Italian restaurants inside. Overall, the entire place was pretty packed since there was a conference going on nearby. The quickest line was for the sliced focaccia pizzas. We were on a time crunch and decided that would be the best option. 

I got the funghi pizza and it was very, very mushroomy. Every bite was filled with mushrooms. I did get a little tired if it towards the end. On the plus side, the texture of the focaccia was nice and soft. If you're looking for an easy, quick bite this place will do the trick."
79,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,1/1/2022,"I stopped at store to purchase some Italian chocolate and entire shelf had a tag displaying  specific price but the item rang at a higher price at the register (33% higher). So, I asked to speak with a manager who I showed the product placement on the shelf and the corresponding price listed for resolution. The manager AGREED that the price tag was incorrect, immediately removed the tag from the shelf (because it was wrong), but REFUSED to honor the price that was on the shelf for my purchase. In disbelief I asked multiple times because she was agreeing with error but continue to say that they would not price match. It was like ""sorry it had the wrong price but it is what it is!"". Please note although this was a small price difference and understand that errors do happen, the management team should have taken the proper action and honored the priced as DISPLAYED, at a minimum. It is not about the small dollar difference but about what is right: accurately displaying the product's price and treating your customer the right way. This was an extremely frustrating experience and they made me feel shameful for asking for a correction that is in my right as a consumer. Love the restaurants at this place but will never return given today's  event."
80,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,5/31/2021,"Delicious Italian food. Was the first time trying the chain and was very impressed with how fresh the ingredients were. Pasta aldente and delicious. Had the pasta with meat sauce and the mozzarella with cherry tomatoes, basil and olive oil. Will be returning for more dishes..."
81,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,10/5/2021,Great experience overall. Great food. Great service. Ronnie the bartender kept us all laughing-and I don't even drink!  We will be back for sure.
82,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,7/23/2021,Came here for happy hour and made a res for the patio. Do make a res as it books up quickly and walk in may be difficult. Great patio seating and they serve bread and service was great. The oysters were also beautifully shucked from Martha's Vineyard. Overall one of my favorite HH oyster place in town
83,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,9/1/2019,"I know it's super touristy (reminds me of a Disney-fied Italy) but I come here every time I'm in Boston because:

It's fun, looks great, and good people watching.
I like to go with a large group of family and find something for everyone - the kids and the seniors. 

We usually graze at the grab and go type places or have oysters at the wine bar and move on to sitting down for dinner at the pizza and pasta place and then walk through the market afterwards for gelato or pastry. 

I have tried the salumi/mixed Italian cold cut appetizer, pizza and pasta and they are pretty solid. I prefer the pizzas over the pastas as the pasta dishes did not taste seasoned enough for me. The cacio Pepe is sadly bland. And it is pretty expensive all around especially the market items.

That's why I think the food is around four stars instead of five - the pasta dishes are mediocre and the prices are high. 

But for a rainy day in Boston or a snowy day in Boston or an unbearably humid day in Boston check it out. Since it's inside you'll be protected from the elements and your belly will be happy."
84,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,8/6/2019,"I came here three times during my short (four day) trip to Boston.

This isn't the first eatily I've been to, I've been to both of the locations in New York.  If you've been to other eatily locations, it's pretty much the same except the restaurants and coffee bar is slightly different.  

I loved the coffee bar at this location! Or at least, the pastries they sold there.  The first day I visited, I got their chocolate and custard croissant.  The next day, I got their burnt wheat and white chocolate croissant and I definitely recommend both !

They can be a bit slow at preparing the coffee so be prepared to wait if you order a drink.  

Walking around the first floor, you can get cheese, produce, fresh pasta, as well as a variety of other foods and goods to bring home.  There are also many take out options such as pizza, sandwiches, and salads.  

They have three restaurants within the market. I tried Terra which I will review separately on their Yelp page (: overall, great place to go whether it be for a sit down lunch or to grab a quick bite to go!"
85,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,2/12/2019,"I just love walking around in this store! It has variety of Italian goodies from raw food to canned goods! So much selections of pasta too which Italians are known for. This store is located at the prudential center and it's so convenient since there is a station right in the building. They have sale sometimes so I take that opportunity to buy something. They are a little bit pricey but the quality is worth it to buy if you are the type that invests in to something like this. They also have restaurants inside that you can sit and eat with friends, a gelato area and hug selection of wine which you can also enjoy while at the restaurant there. It's busy most of the time but when it's almost closing it gets a little less crowded. 
I always come back to this store so till next stop!"
86,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,10/6/2021,"Went over expecting a wow experience, first time over and last so far. The food was so dull, no color no flavor at all, lack of seasoning and so overpriced. For the location should make an effort on innovate."
87,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,4/7/2021,I love Eatly! I went to some great in-person events before the pandemic started and I've really enjoyed the virtual classes that they offer now. The virtual tiramisu class was very fun - they sent us the meal kit the day before and a lovely wine pairing. My mother and I are doing the terra dinner virtual class next. I also ate outside at their patio restaurant and they did a great job complying with all the safety measures.
88,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,6/17/2019,"We loved the Eataly in Chicago, so we decided to come to this one while visiting Boston. It's pretty much the same concept, with various stalls that serve gelato, seafood, meats, cheeses, etc.  It also serves as a grocery with fresh vegetables, pasta, etc.  

Prices are a little on the higher side, but not too egregious. I ended up purchasing some American wagyu coulette from the meat market here since there was a sale going on. Cooked these for dinner and they were excellent. Not as fatty as other wagyu I've had but still awesome. 

One big issue I had with this version of Eataly is that it's WAY too cramped. There's too many narrow pathways that lead to overcrowding, especially near the entrance."
89,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,1/31/2020,"I visited the location to find a wine new to Eataly USA. One of my friends is the producer and made a post saying that his wine was now available across all US stores, including Boston. 

The wine manager I spoke with when I arrived tonight said he had never heard of it, and was quite rude. He just didn't seem to care that I had come all the way into Boston to find this particular Italian wine, which is incredible. It's even featured on Eataly's website for Valentine's Day!

I was also a bit disappointed he didn't take down my name and gave me a call when/ if the wine should arrive.

Totally unpleasant experience here!"
0,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/18/2022,I lovee Bootleg!! The food is amazing especially the seafood! My boyfriend went for the first time with me on valentine day & he loves it (he's a very picky eater). The urban/culture low lighting setting gives off a romantic/private setting & we Loved it! Definitely try this place!!
1,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/24/2022,I will totally be back! Very nice place cozy and comfortable and excellent customer service.
2,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,4/5/2022,"Came here on a Sunday morning for a birthday brunch. Had the oysters, beignets, cornbread to start. Cornbread was ok (no one at the table loved the bits of corn in it). Oysters were perfection, as were the beignets.  Everyone at the table agreed the bootleg Benedict I ordered was some of the best they'd ever had- HIGHLY recommend. Strawberry soufflé pancakes were ok but very sweet (order for the table to share) French toast was good. Standout dish would be the garlic noodles also. We got a app but they have a dinner and brunch version I would 1000% get again. 
Ambiance and service were top notch and they even let us sit a little longer than our allotted time so be sure to watch you clock because it flies by! 

Their signature passion fruit mimosa was the fan favourite of the table also. I ordered a French 75 which was also done well!"
3,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,3/13/2022,"Last time I came here for brunch was years ago and I remember I had a good experience with good food. Came here again recently this time for dinner. Such a hip and trendy spot. It almost reminds me of a speakeasy because the outside is so lowkey and nothing special. But as soon as you walk in, the atmosphere is so lively and has lots of New Orleans-type vibes (which I think was the goal of the restaurant). 

We ordered a few plates to share including the squid ink fried rice, garlic noodles, lobster crab mac and cheese, and crispy wings. Everything was super tasty and we all enjoyed it, but it wasn't quite a ""WOW"" in my opinion. The fried rice, garlic noodles and mac and cheese are listed under ""social plates"" on the menu so I assumed it would be big enough for a group of 4 to share, but honestly I thought it was pretty small and seemed like it could be a portion for 1 person. The taste itself of each dish was really good, my favorite would probably be the squid ink fried rice, but overall as a whole the food wasn't anything to really rave about. 

Drinks were delicious. I had the mandarin mule and almond blossom. Just sweet enough for me! My boyfriend had the law of motion, and if you're looking for a super strong drink, get that one. Overall had a good experience here~ very trendy restaurant with excellent cocktails. I would come back agajn to re-try the brunch, and get more cocktails!!"
4,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/5/2022,"As others have commented, from the outside it looks like the restaurant is closed but once you go inside the decorations and interior design looks great. I made a reservation on Yelp for a Sunday night dinner with some friends.

For drinks we got the Buddhist Tooth (Japanese Whisky, Honey, and Soda), Mandarin mule (Vodka, Lime, and Ginger Beer), and a gin and tonic. The drinks were good and came out very photogenic.   

For appetizers, I would recommend the crispy wings with chili butter glaze, chicken under a brick pinchos (essentially chicken skewers), Thai basil garlic fries (comes with a really good creamy sauce) and easy street corn. Each of these dishes were fantastic. 

For sharable entrees, we got the signature garlic noodles with shrimp and the lobster-crab mac and cheese. The noodles were good, but I would not recommend adding the shrimp since we paid $8 to only get 4 pieces of shrimp. 

For dessert, we got to the five layer chocolate cake that came with chocolate hazelnut sauce and raspberries. Surprisingly, it wasn't super sweet and was more dark chocolate which I love. 

Overall, come here for good food and a great experience and feel like you've briefly teleported to Louisiana."
5,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/26/2022,"Really cool place with a unique vibe. Delicious Cajun style seafood! The other reviews that say ""it looks closed but it's open"" are 100% true. 

Visiting Boston, I knew seafood was a must. The quality and taste of the food at this restaurant blew me away! Huge portions. The signature sauce is great but very spicy (and messy!) 

The best way to describe this place is a restaurant that looks & sounds like a club. The lights are dim, the music is bumpin' and the drinks are strong. The artwork is definitely cool and the bar is nice. Would recommend for a date night or night out with friends (not really a family dinner kinda place). 

Only suggestion for this place would be to make it known that you're open for business. The outside is dull, dark and looks closed. If it weren't for Yelp I would not have found it."
6,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/24/2022,"We decided to go out for a weekday dinner and this was one of the few options available on a Monday night within a short ride of our hotel. We arrived to an inconspicuous looking building on a corner next to a CVS and immediately thought: this is a bar.
Until we opened the door. The restaurant is completely incongruous from the outside but on the inside, it's dark, moody, and very modern. Think a lot of metal, leather, and concrete. 

We were seated in the back next to a long curtain leading to the back- is there a club back there! We will never know. All I know is that there was an unfortunate draft coming through those curtains. 

We were very impressed by the menu and ordered a variety of small plates including the spicy scallop tacos, the steak tartare, the roast Brussels sprouts and cauliflower, the street corn and the garlic noodles. This is precisely how to experience this menu- try it ALL! We ran out of room before finishing the elote (street corn) buy everything was DELISH.

The garlic noodles were HOT, well seasoned and soothing. The steak tartare was perfectly medium rare, the sauce was Asian inspired and the crunch of the sesame seeds in the marinade completed the experience of each bite effortlessly. The elote was excellent and authentic. I loved every bite. The roasted veggies were crisp and well seasoned and not greasy, which was delightful.

Lest I forget- their wine pairings are PERFECTION. I had the California Pinot Noir and it paired to perfection with the steak and garlic noodles. My friend tried a sake and it was quite lovely with the scallops and elote. 

Though we were reaching the top at this point, we had to try dessert. The beignets AND the chocolate cake. We demolished the beignets, which were not QUITE as puffy and light as a Cafe du Monde beignet but WERE authentic, hot, well flavored (not sweet) and coated with just the right amount of powdered sugar to be delectable. We were exhausted and didn't want coffee but these would be ideal accompanied by some chicory coffee.

We took the chocolate cake to go but it was also delicious. Paired with fresh, ripe raspberries and espresso powder, it was THE PERFECT midnight snack lol."
7,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,12/8/2021,"We dined here because a coworker and I were in Boston on business. We searched Yelp for seafood places and this on came up. We were pleasantly surprised to see it was $1 Oyster Thursday night! I was excited.

The atmosphere was really cool. Pretty young crowd but all we cared about was the food. The oysters were Amazon!!! I had 2 platters of them! I should've ate that all night but since I'm a foodie I wanted to try some other things on the menu. 

I had the snow crab with potatoes and my coworker had the shrimp with potatoes. We both built our own boils.

My coworker was pleased with her shrimp. They were sweet and yummy. Both our potatoes weren't cooked all the way through. A lot of them were still uncooked. 

A lot of my crab legs had zero meat in them and that was frustrating since it was pretty pricey. I told my waiter but there wasn't much he could do about it. The meat that I did get was good. Our waiter was very attentive and suggested our drink choices. They were ok as well. I had the sangria. I think a white sangria would've paired better with the seafood.

I also had the beignets for dessert. I didn't take a picture because we forgot and we didn't like them. It's best just to eat them in New Orleans. 

Overall the seafood and service was good. Next time I'll just enjoy the Oysters and a nice beer. My tab alone was $100. Was it worth it? No. Especially since I wasn't able to enjoy my crab legs and potatoes..."
8,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/20/2022,"I came here for dinner and drinks with a friend on a Friday night. The outside of the restaurant is very unassuming, but the inside is really colorful and hip.

We started with ordering cocktails. I'm not the biggest cocktail person, but Bootleg Special seems like a restaurant where you order a cocktail. I had the Moral Fable, which was made with mezcal and blackberries. It was well-balanced with alcohol/flavor. For dinner, we decided to split a few small plates. We picked the twice cooked pork fillet, the squid ink fried rice, and the street corn. The pork fillet was good, but a bit dry in my opinion. The fried rice came with a few scallops, muscles, and calamari, but had a generous portion of rice. The street corn was my favorite; it was topped with Cotija cheese and chili cream, and was very flavorful. 

Our waitress was attentive throughout the dinner service and the other staff seemed very nice, too. My only gripe is that the music was so loud that it was difficult to hear the conversation at times, but I think it was just the vibe of the restaurant. I would definitely recommend Bootleg Special to anyone looking for a fun place to have dinner or drinks."
9,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/5/2022,"Oh my goodness!!!! I want to come back here every time I'm in Boston! I wanted to take my sister to a nice brunch and this place was recommended to us, and it did not disappoint! The portions, the flavor, the ambiance, the service. Everything was literally perfect! We wanted to try a little bit of everything so we did! Shrimp n Grits, crab legs, crab avocado toast?soufflé pancakes, oysters, and the drinks!!! It's making my mouth water thinking about it now lol"
10,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/30/2022,"Umm this place is bomb ! The decor is very is funky I love it. Staff was very nice. I love the ambiance of this place. Garlic noodles are a must try , I added shrimp they were so good. It's worth ordering two bowls of the noodles to fill you up. The cucumber salad was very light, but tasty. The oysters were great. This place was cool, def feeling the ambiance . Good spot to eat good and just vibe out. Enjoy!"
11,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"I found out this place had souffle pancakes a while ago but I never got to try it until recently. I came here with a friend on Sunday for brunch. We got there at 11AM, right when they opened, without a reservation (we had just made plans to come here the night before). They said they had no tables available but we gave them our name and phone number and they said they would text us if they had any cancellations or no-shows (they only reserve tables for 15 minutes past the reserved time). I guess someone cancelled or didn't show up to their reservation because we were able to get seated by around 11:20.

We sat at the bar and started off with drinks. I got the ""You Can't Sip With Us"" which was very fruity, sweet, and delicious. Then we ordered a build-a-bowl with just mussels and no add-ins, with the signature bootleg special sauce. The sauce was very garlicky and soooo good. If you love garlic, you'll love it. If you hate garlic, this is not the dish for you. It comes with a side of bread which you can dip in the sauce. 

We also ordered the souffle pancakes, the main reason I wanted to visit this place. We got the strawberries creme fraiche pancakes. It looked just like the pictures I'd seen online- no false advertising here! The pancakes were very light, fluffy, and the perfect amount of sweetness to balance out the garlic mussels we'd just eaten.

Overall I highly recommend this place and it is definitely worth the hype!"
12,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,11/6/2021,"Fun place! The exterior makes the place look closed but definitely not so! Like a restaurant meets club, and aesthetically pleasing. 
Very quick and friendly service. Large portions. 
Everything is delish! 
Cajun fried rice had a ton of flavor. Wish the crispy wings and octopus had more sauce - the more subtle flavors were washed out by the fried rice.  
Their seafood boil is very heavy on the garlic but so so good. Comes with 2 large slices of bread which is actually a really good idea for the sauce but like I said.  Huge portions.  

Would definitely recommend if you've never had a seafood boil before and not very fond of dipping things in butter (like me)."
13,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,10/31/2021,"My husband and I came here because we REALLY wanted seafood while we stayed in Boston.  We came in jeans and a t-shirt, and felt out of place when we walked inside.  The hostess was courteous towards us.  We did not have a reservation, but thankfully there were tables available.  

Our waitress was extremely nice.  She engaged in conversations with us, and made us feel welcome.  We ordered Mama Sue's ""Big Bowl of Crabs"" with classic garlic butter sauce, and it was pure heaven.  My husband and I didn't talk much during dinner because we were too busy cracking crab and eating.  We ate every single bite! This dinner was definitely the best we had when we stayed in Boston!"
14,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/25/2022,Would definitely recommend coming here for the boil!! It was delicious and super messy. I would recommend offering a bib because I definitely got very messy as I was elbow seem in crab. Really good drinks as well!
15,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,1/23/2022,"Came here for a weekend brunch and I was simply blown away by their SOUFFLE PANCAKES (banana foster). The pancakes are light and fluffy, akin to an angel-food-cake lightness. They're glazed with a delicious spiced rum and banana liquor sauce, and paired with fresh whipped cream.

I remember this place having a killer chicken sandwich. But sadly their brunch menu is a bit limited. Home Fries Au Gratin was a bit lackluster, with soggy home fries and barely melted cheese."
16,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"vibes: mardi gras speakeasy in a warehouse. Odd location and it looks closed from the outside, but honestly very cool from the inside. 

Food was 4/5 - We got the crab boil, which was contained all the usual suspects: corn, sausage, potatoes, crab, lobster, clams, crayfish.  It was intensely flavorful with a good heat. Beignets were also similar to ones in New Orleans. My one gripe is that the seafood boil is garlic HEAVY. I love garlic, but it got a little overpowering near the end, almost like I was taking shots of garlic. 

Service 5/5: the service was top notch. Our waitress noticed even the small things - like relighting the table candle, offering additional bread w our crab boil, or giving out mint-scented hot towels after eating."
17,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,3/19/2022,"I was excited to check out this place but I left with disappointment of their food. I came here for dinner with a Yelp reservation so I didn't have to wait long. The restaurant is totally different from its outside look. The inside has a cool club vibe. The waitress was nice and attentive. But here comes the disappointment. My friends ordered Cajun fried rice and big bowl of crabs. First, the coke zero was so flat. Second, the fried rice was super salty (I'm guessing too much Cajun seasoning). Third, the snow crab in the big bowl was not fresh (when I cracked the leg, the meat was only half of the leg). Next, the potatoes were just boiled separately and added on so they had no flavor. Last, the white rice ordered on the side was so over cooked and too wet. The only good part was the noodles and the bread comes with the big bowl. Overall, my expectations were not met and not worth with the price. I wouldn't recommend and definitely don't think that I will ever be back."
18,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/30/2022,"Amazing ambience, friendly staff and tasty food.
I highly recommend it! Just excellent!!"
19,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/27/2022,"AMAZING. I had my 21st birthday brunch here & I loved it. It's a vibe in there, the decor is beautiful & the food was pretty good. I had the lobster Mac & cheese which was 10/10 and the strawberry fluffy pancakes which were OKAY, since they're so airy it kinda felt like I was eating nothing.... But besides that it was fine. 
They had an amazing birthday platter that the table beside me ordered for me, the drinks were bomb & the leprechaun cereal drink was super strong with baileys!! The service was awesome as well!! The servers were so nice, always came to refill our water and make sure our food was good. They let us take our time when ordering & we stayed there for a few hours just talking, eating, and enjoying the vibes!! This is def a diamond & must try!!! So pretty."
20,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/26/2022,"Bootleg Special is THE place for a hip, trendy, filling dinner. I booked a table for a large party here for my birthday after seeing another Yelp review about a lucky charms cocktail (which they sadly didn't serve during dinnertime). 

The food? BOMB. The drinks? SNATCHED. The lobster? BOILED. The noodles? GARLICKED. The grilled octopus? NEVER HAD OCTOPUS THIS SOFT BEFORE. Lobster mac and cheese? Crispy, creamy, cheesy. Me after this dinner???? Completely deceased. 

Honestly, coming into this dinner, I had only done research into the cocktails, which were so yummy and giant. I had no idea that my friends and I would leave so content and full, nor did I know that a Cajun restaurant this hip and delicious existed in Boston. I'd definitely come back to Bootleg to eat (and drink) again."
21,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,9/11/2021,"Ambiance: 2.5/5
From the outside, the restaurant looked closed. My family and I hesitated before opening the door. As we stepped inside to enter, the music was loud and the dining area was dark. It was difficult to see anything. 

Food: 3/5
- Mama Sue's Crab ($185)-- my family liked it. Too oily for my taste buds.
- Oyster 25 ($25)-- we all enjoyed it!
- Garlic Noodles ($10)-- flavorful. Couldn't get enough of it.
- Thai Basil Fries 2 ($10ea)-- yummy!
- Lobster Mac Cheese ($18)-- sons liked it.
- Cajun Fried Rice ($13)-- tasty.
- Side Sauce ($3)

Service: 4/5
Nhi did a great job of attending to us.

Likes:
- Garlic noodles
- Oyster

Dislikes:
- Loud music
- Dark dining room, couldn't see what I was eating
- Noodles beneath Mama Sue's Crab, very oily

22,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,8/14/2021,"Lobster Mac & Cheese 7/10: it was okay and edible. I definitely had better. The Mac and cheese needed a bit more seasoning as well as cheese. The seafood taste over powered the cheese taste, and it was a tad bit watery at the bottom due to the steamed lobster in it. Do not recommend.

Yellow Tail Special 10/10: this drink was amazing and got the job done. I love cognac, in particular, Dusse, and this was a well created cocktail. The drink was a bit pricey at $16 but it's all top shelf liquor. 

I would come to this place strictly for the drinks and maybe a few appetizers, which are a shareable size. I'm a lil iffy about the seafood boils and other seafood options. This is suppose to be a ""New Orleans"" cuisine restaurant, but if you have experienced real creole food then don't expect that from this place."
23,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,1/14/2022,"Decided to come here again for my friend's birthday dinner and it was an amazing night. Our waitress named Brittney was super sweet and attentive the whole night and made the experience very enjoyable for my friends and I. The food did fall a little flat from when we were here last time. I had high expectations for the lobster mac and cheese and was disappointed with how bland it tasted. 

Nonetheless the presentation of the food and atmosphere made up for it. My only complaint is that they should add more items to the menu, there isn't a lot of options to choose from. I hope in the near future they add more items."
24,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,8/31/2021,"After looking for a seafood restaurant, we came across Bootleg and made reservations which I'm glad we did since it was packed when we arrived. 

I must've drove around the block for a good 15minutes trying to find parking or legal parking lot. I finally lucked up and parked down the street by the traffic light. I was u sure about a designated parking lot and being from out of state, I didn't want to take a chance. 

We had 9:30 pm reservations and I did see tables set up for outside dining but it had been raining that evening. I was initially skeptical because it looked like it was closed from the outside but when you open the door you entered into a dim lite space and are immediately greeted by the host. The host was kind and friendly and informed us that he was waiting to clean a table and would seat us immediately. 

Once seated we were immediately greeted by our waitress who was wearing her mask and who took our drink orders and returned shortly. A clockwork yellow was really good and really strong  didn't taste the teaches peaches but heard it was tasty and good as well. 

We ordered the build your own boil with crab legs, lobster, corn and potatoes. You have to request corn and potatoes if you want them in your boil. We ordered the bootleg sauce as well as a side of garlic butter. Prior to our food arriving we received 2 slices of toasted bread for us to soak up the seafood juices that were very tasty. The crab legs were fresh and seasoned perfectly, the corn was sweet and fresh as well, I wanted at least 2 more pieces of corn it was so good. The potatoes were small and ok. We didn't receive the garlic butter we asked for until midway through our meal but she also didn't charge us for it, it wasn't tasty either so I'm glad. The lobster also had good flavor and wasn't rubbery. 

Inside was dim lighting and didn't appear to be all that much seating."
25,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"We came Halloween weekend and they had decked the whole place out! Loved the atmosphere. The drinks were great! The crab legs were well worth it too!
*Disclaimer: This is a seafood/shellfish place and there are no other options.
(I am allergic lol but came because my friends wanted to. The only thing on the menu for me were the garlic noodles. They didn't totally fill me up, but they were very good!)"
26,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,11/12/2021,"I would not have expected to find this homage to NOLA on a random Boston corner, but thank you internet, that's exactly what happened. The raw oyster special was fresh and reminded me of the ocean. The street corn was a fun experience, but would have benefited from a juicier corn. The mac and cheese was good, as anything with lobster is. The desserts amazing though, excellent way to end the meal. The aesthetic was a little hard to see in the dark, but it definitely felt like a New Orleans bar!"
27,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,7/17/2021,"This is where you can enjoy your boil without being messy. They serve the meal on a plate rather than having you fish them through a bag.

We ordered the crawfish with their signature sauce, mussels with garlic/butter, and Cajun fried rice. Oh, the Cajun fried rice was so crispy and seasoned so well. Both the boil dishes were delicious.

Drink-wise, try the Teaches of Peaches - it is a strong tasty drink. For dessert, definitely try the cheesecake...it was better than the chocolate cake.

The service was excellent, and our server was very accommodating with one of our friends with gluten-free needs (sauce on the side). 

Highly recommended if you are in the area"

29,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,8/4/2021,"Boston has the best seafood y'all and the cutest local restaurants. 

While visiting last week we revisited @bootlegspecial. I was craving a seafood boil so of course we had to revisit. This restaurant has such a spunky and eccentric decor and definitely sets the mood for date night. 

Located across the bridge from the theatre district downtown, @boss is a great place to grab dinner before a fun night on the town. 

I love how they took their own spin on the traditional seafood boil, as you can tell from the picture it was so flavorful and delicious. 

 Foodie Rating :  out of 5 

Pros: 
Close to downtown , walking distance from theatre district. 
Great small plate selection (octopus + oysters  )
Ideal date night location
Offers brunch on Saturday and Sunday ft. boozy cereal  

Cons: 
Popular location : reservations suggested 
$$$ splurging happens easily
Dimly lit bad for photos
Only 1 location

30,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,5/8/2021,"Came as a party of four -- made a reservation for a Saturday evening and it was PACKED. Even had tables right next to each other indoors, which made me a little nervous given COVID.

Ordered The Bootleg Special and Lobster & Crab Mac and Cheese for the table. Was the perfect amount for four! 

The Lobster & Crab Mac and Cheese was amazing with chunks of lobster and crab throughout -- they did not skimp out!! 

The Bootleg Special we ordered with their house sauce, which has a bit of a kick. The crawfish were the same size as our shrimp and had tiny amounts of meat. The lobster was amazing and was already cut in half with shell partially broken for us to easily eat. We were also given little plastic gloves to eat without getting our hands dirty. 

The drink that I got -- ""You Can't Sip With Us"" -- tasted a bit like medicine/ Gatorade. Wouldn't recommend this particular drink, but the food is good!"
31,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,4/8/2022,"We spent a fantastic evening here.  The food was beyond our expectations, service was attentive and well timed, and drinks were a perfect compliment to the food and evening.  The ambiance was unexpected and surprising.  It was perfect.  We will definitely come back on our next trip.  Wonderful, amazing, fantastic, perfect and enjoyable.  What more can be said?"
32,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,4/9/2022,"Boston is just amazing, and I am OBSESSED with this restaurant!  Why are you reading reviews? Go ahead and enjoy it!"
33,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,1/13/2022,"The interior and ambiance really did make you feel like you were in NOLA. The service was wonderful and the complimentary bread went well with the juices from the seafood boil. As for the seafood boil, the lobster, crawfish, and shrimp tasted wonderful. However, I think the mussels were old since they left a really strong sea-like aftertaste. I've personally never had a problem with fishy smells/aftertaste but the mussels here were a little too unbearable for me to eat. For the flavoring of the seafood boil my friends and I got the Signature Bootleg. It tasted amazing, however, you might want to bring some gum or mints since the amount of garlic they use is astounding. Overall, I think this restaurant was a fun girls night out!"
34,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,11/3/2021,"Absolutely loved our experience here. Their Halloween decorations were awesome and the overall ambiance of the restaurant was great. Our waitress was fantastic and answered all of our questions. 

We ordered the Easy Street Corn, Thai Basil Garlic Fries, and Blackened Ribeye Tips. We loved each plate but if you only get one of these, go for the Easy Street Corn -- it was SO good. The Ribeye Tips were fatty but tender and delicious and the Thai Basil Garlic Fries were super flavorful.

We ordered the Mandarin Mule and Rum Rhapsody for drinks. Highly recommend trying the Mandarin Mule.

We also got the 5 Layer Chocolate Cake for dessert. This is a MUST. It was so rich, chocolatey, and delicious. Perfect way to end the night."
35,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,1/29/2022,"Went here for bfast. This place seems like a speakeasy on the outside, but on the inside it is very strange - it's a huge warehouse with strange decor that isn't particularly cozy or cool. However, the food is great. We went for brunch and got amazing cocktails - you have to get the boozy cereal leprechaun's trap is delicious (more of a drink than a food item). The soufflé pancakes are delicious! I wish they had a more expansive menu of breakfast food at brunch at brunch because the food we did order was great."
36,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,3/30/2021,"I came here for a Saturday brunch (3/27), hostess' attitude was such a bummer. They should really consider someone more welcoming for the face of the restaurant. 

Ambiance is great, super pretty, trendy and Covid friendly! The drinks were tasty and strong but the food fell short for me. We ordered a few apps - Oysters were okay and scallion tacos were good. Lobster Mac and cheese was a hard pass for me and the rib eye lacked seasoning. For the pricing, I expected the food to be better. We decided to opt out on entrees but did try the beignets- wasn't a fan. Service was good, food came out pretty quick. 

Unfortunately, I don't think the ambiance and drinks are worth returning for."
37,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,4/25/2021,"Heard really good things about this place from my friends so I had to give it a try.

It was my cousin's birthday so I decided to get two seafood boil of my choice. First tray was just 2-3 orders of mussels with sausage, corn, potatoes and a side order of their garlic noodles (amazing!). The mussels were great and we loved the sauce ( paid $3-4 more for extra sauce) . 

Second tray, this is when things took a turn LOL I got crab legs and CRAWFISH. Assuming the crawfish should be good if I'm paying $15-16 dollar a pound for it. Let's start off with the crab legs. The crab legs seemed fresh so that was good. The meat paired with their extra spicy sauce was amazing. I added sausage and garlic noodles to the boil. I did not know they were going to put the noodles in the tray . Thought it would be on the side . Moving on to the crawfish.....

There were probably 18-24 crawfish in this tray. Not kidding , half were horrible. The meat was MUSHY and BLACK. As you can see by the pictures I took, yeah we were not happy LOL the tray itself costed like $70. We were so disappointed ... 

I would give it two stars but upon arrival, the hostess was super nice and helpful. First time actually being inside, the set up was nice. Very nice and cozy."
38,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/17/2022,"Bootleg special is such a gem. Hands down my favorite place to eat - my go to dishes and must trys are the garlic noodles, bootleg seafood boil, crispy octopus and lobster Mac and cheese. For dessert, finish off with some Macarons and beignets. They are so good! 

Brunch is also to die for! Try their cornbread, bootleg Benedict, and soufflé pancakes - best I've ever had! 

This place is just an overall great place to hang out - delicious food, drinks, music, ambiance - what more can you ask for. I highly recommend!!!"
39,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/20/2022,"I have eaten at the restaurant multiple times and ordered it via Uber eats many times as well.  From the fantastic service to the quality of the food you can NOT be dissatisfied with Bootleg special.  The garlic noodles with shrimp is their signature along with the sirloin truffle steak.  The flavors work.  When I dine inside the restaurant I am amazed by the attention to detail, the vibe inside, and the quality of the staff.  Located on the south end/back bay line, this is a definite must for a bite to eat or simply a cocktail!  5 stars all the way.  Oh, before I forget, the boil is delicious!!!"
40,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/29/2022,"Think butter, garlic heaven! 

I wouldn't recommend going here on date night cos things get messy! 

We ordered the garlic noodles which were great, the garlic basil fries, spicy scallop tacos and the boil with lobster with the signature bootleg sauce. 

The cocktails are really good too and the vibe is fun."

I can't wait to come back To enjoy one of the Cajun boil's."
42,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,9/27/2021,"I'm usually not one to go back multiple times to a restuarant, but this place is definitely the exception. I've come here for their specialty japanese fluffy pancakes, which are always amazing, and this time I came back to try some of their savoury options, which did not disappoint in the slightest. We got the shrimp and grits, as well as the garlic noodles and the crushed cucumber salad. The shrimp and grits were creamy and cheesy, perfectly balanced out by the corn and tomatoes it was served with. The garlic noodes were a simple 12/10. And the cucumber salad was the perfect fresh and acidic complement to the two main dishes. If that wasn't all, the service is always great. Will be coming back for sure."

I was surprised by the atmosphere. Very club like. In a very cool way. The light and music, the deco, the entire place is very cool.

Our server was amazing! On top of food and drinks and very accommodating.

The food was outstanding. The chicken sausage gumbo poutine was out of this world. The seafood boil perfect! And the beignets just like in good old New Orleans. Absolutely delicious!

Perfect spot for a celebration with great friends or a cool family."

The creamy and pineapple with alcohol were a great blend, For our dinners We had the bootleg social with mussels. I had the lobster Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was okay needs more flavor I also had aside of shrimp  sautéed with butter that was great and fresh. Overall this place is amazing the interior designer deserves the greatest of recognition. The industrial look with a hint of chandeliers I felt that.  The only issue is parking you may have to walk.  We will be back for brunch !!!"

47,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/3/2022,Portion was tiny BUT very tasty. Would recommend getting a side order of potatoes if you have an appetite. There was definitely a considerable portion of lobster and the sauce they use was spicy.
48,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,6/26/2021,"Another absolute 5 star restaurant! The brunch experience here exceeded my expectations!
Service: we reserved an outdoor table and brought our dog. The server was very considerate and brought us a bowl of water for the dog. She was attentive and very nice.
Food: we ordered lobster Benedict, crab avocado toast, soufflé pancakes and maple pecan beignet. I recommend all of them! Def unique Cajun seafood style brunch items!
Lobster Benedict def have lots of Cajun seasoning! The bread is soaked in the flavorful sauce and poached egges were cooked to perfection! 
Crab avocado toast was HUGE! Fresh crab meat on top of generous amount of freshly cut avocado on top of thick brioche toast! Best avocado toast I've ever had! It doesn't come with eggs but you can add extra poached eggs with it!
Loved the beignet! Super fluffy! The fried dough itself is not sweet. The sweetness comes from the powdered sugar. Maple pecan beignet is just classic beignet with a giant scoop of maple pecan icecream. Def a very generous portion of dessert. I'd say if you decided to order it, def save some room for these tasty guys!!

Will come back to try their dinner seafood boils!!"

Last week I ordered delivery through UberEats and received crab legs with parasites on them.  Fortunately enough with the help of Uber I received a full refund for my order. I was concerned that the food was chosen, cooked, packaged and sent to me and no one noticed or cared to remove it. Both clusters were infested. I will likely never eat here again."

54,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,11/17/2020,"**ordered via UberEats**
It was my friend's birthday and due to covid we decided to treat ourselves with takeout. We were feeling seafood and came across Bootleg Special and the photos and menu items looked tempting. We were not sure of how much food we were going to receive so went all out and got the bootleg special with garlic noodles and garlic fries and then also got the traditional beignets for dessert. We will realize later that this is a feast for many and not two but hey, no regrets!

OMG - if you like seafood and garlic then you're in for a treat! The bootleg special has a mix of all types of seafood and you can pick the sauce and sides it's made in. I picked Cajun sauce and went with potatoes and noodles. The garlic was overwhelming but since we both a fans, we did not mind. The restaurant added some gloves that we were thankful for because we definitely needed those. 

The noodles and garlic fries are a must try! Again, we did not bother with utensils and dug in. The food came with what seemed like garlic bread. Given the amount of food, I'll probably skip out on any sides. 

The beignets were freshly fried and were soft and smelled amazing. Unfortunately we did not have space to indulge in them, so we had them for breakfast the next day. Still a scrumptious experience. It is a little on the pricey side, but you're getting a whole lotta seafood. 

Lots of leftover, lots of fun and overall a very ""hands on experience"". Would definitely order again from the regular menu."
55,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,11/29/2021,"I loved Bootleg Special! My boyfriend and I grabbed dinner and drinks here on a rainy Friday evening. The exterior of the place looks v sus, but once you step inside, the atmosphere and decor are on point. The host/hostesses are super nice and the waitstaff are great. The cocktails were delicious and the food did not disappoint. We ordered the avocado rojo oysters, cajun fried rice, garlic noodles, and the tenderloin. Everything was fantastic. It wasn't busy when we got there around 7:00pm, but the place started filling up around 8:00/8:30. I'd definitely recommend grabbing a reservation, if you can. Can't wait to come back here, maybe to check out their brunch menu :)"
56,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,5/17/2021,"Four friends and I visited on a Saturday morning for brunch and were extremely lucky to have gotten a table, especially with our party size. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but the ambience was much better inside. 

A friend and I shared the Bootleg Benedict and the Strawberries & Cream Soufflé Pancakes. The benedict was delicious but extremely salty. Both of us drank an obscene amount of water to compensate, making us fuller than needed. The pancakes were quite average, with nothing particularly special about them. 

Although the food wasn't the most memorable, one thing I really appreciated was the service. Our waiter was extremely accommodating and didn't charge us the usually gratuity that usually applies for parties of five or more."
57,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,6/4/2021,"Highly suggest the $1 oysters on Thursday! The bartenders are great. The choice of hand crafted cocktails is wonderful. Atmosphere is a fun vibe, with chill music and amazing artwork! A must find when  you come to Boston."
58,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,11/23/2021,"This is a spot I love bringing visitors to. They usually have a lot of reservations open and the Cajun boils they have are consistent and so yummy! I always do the bootleg sauce and have tried a variety of the seafood available in the boil. My reco would be to get shrimp and lobster for the boil with corn added. I'm not a fan of the sausage they have - there must be an herb in it I don't like that much that is very strong, maybe marjoram? Anyway I'd skip the sausage but would definitely add corn and get a side of rice. I also really love the garlic noodles! And for drinks the banana one they have is my favorite. Will continue to come back for a special meal when I have visitors."
59,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"Came a second time since we really enjoyed our first visit. Had a build a boil, crushed cucumber and my favorite ceviche oysters. And topped it with 5 layer chocolate cake. All great and good service."
60,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"LOVED this place! I was skeptical because we only went here because our top choices were fully booked for brunch on a Saturday. This place had an available reservation, so we decided to go. So glad we did! Our waitress was phenomenal. The wings were ""perfectly cooked"" (my bf's words) crispy and slightly spicy. My Bootleg Benedict (lobster, crab, and a spicy sauce) was excellent and so were the souffle pancakes. Mimosas kept coming, and the cocktails were great too. Decor was beautiful, even the walk to the bathroom was interestingly decorated. Would definitely go back."
61,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,4/1/2022,"We went to this restaurant before COVID and had such a great time. It is very hard to find the door, and we were not sure when we stumbled upon it. There are quite a number of stairs down to the restaurant. But the services were warm and friendly. The food choices were fun and very southern. And we greatly enjoyed the environment as well as the food. I would recommend getting one of the boils - nothing like a table covered in newspaper and scattered with shellfish, corn, and potatoes. Great fun. We will definitely go back again."
62,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/10/2022,"Amazing food, drink and service. While a bit pricey, I can't think of a better place to experience seafood Boston / Cajun style."
63,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,2/5/2022,Doesn't look like much when you walk past it and it's kind of hard to find in Chinatown but I did appreciate a place that had beignets. I'm from California so I really depending on Disneyland to provide amazing new orlean style beignets but I thought this place did a pretty good job with the dessert menu. Food was really good as well. Ordered garlic noodles and it was so aromatic and filling. It's a really great place to hang with friends if you want a good atmosphere and vibes for the evening.
64,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/23/2022,"This food was amazing! It was a pleasant surprise to be in a majority-POC space, and an even better surprise with the delicious food. The atmosphere and the decor was so lively even though I was there at 12 pm. I ordered the fluffy pancakes, and the cajun mix with clams, shrimp, and sausage. There was a solid amount in there and I recommend splitting it with another person to finish it! It was my first time eating the viral fluffy pancakes, and this was the perfect place to try them! However, I do like the other dipping more than the creme brulee one. The cajun was nicely seasoned with a little kick of spice, so I ordered a side of white rice to calm the heat down a little bit. I will definitely come back here again! We need more places like this in the Boston area."
65,Bootleg Special,2 star rating,11/30/2021,Wouldn't go here for brunch. Waste of time- not a lot of choices ended up basically ordering what I would eat for a normal night out..... only good thing is the drinks
66,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,5/2/2021,"I had a great time here! Beautiful interior, great service, and delicious food. We booked reservations in advance and were immediately seated. They had hand sanitizer available at the front and all staff wearing masks. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. The drinks and food were all delicious! We tried the bananas foster soufflé pancakes, garlic noodles with shrimp, and gumbo poutine. We loved everything we got and the portion sides were good too. The food came out pretty quickly. We had a wonderful time here and I would definitely recommend trying this place out."
67,Bootleg Special,2 star rating,9/19/2021,"I went to Bootleg Special for lunch with a colleague.  We were greeted by the host looking down his nose at us and asking if we had a reservation (we didn't).  Lacking a reservation, we were advised to take a seat at the bar.  There were three small tables open in the dining room.

Having navigated the first obstacle to an enjoyable lunch, we sat down and encountered the second.  Bootleg doesn't have printed menus; instead, you're expected to scan a QR code with your phone, which links to the restaurant's website.  The website has a poorly scanned image of -- you guessed it: a printed menu! -- meaning you have to repeatedly pan around the image, zooming in and out to figure out what you want.  As you can imagine, this is tedious and annoying.

After a couple of minutes the bartender took our orders.  My colleague ordered shrimp and grits, while I ordered a ""jumbo"" shrimp boil with corn (jumbo is in quotes for a reason: they weren't).  The bartender asked me if I wanted the kitchen to remove the shrimp heads, to which I responded, ""Sure, that'd be great.""  Remember this; it's going to come up again.

My colleague's meal arrived in just a few minutes.  Mine, well, not so much.  He was half done before mine appeared.  We both thought the food was decent but unremarkable.  My boil sauce had good flavor but was extremely salty.

When the bill arrived, I had been charged $6.00 to decapitate my shrimp!  No mention of this charge was made when I ordered, but they stuck it on the bill anyway.  In my view, this is utterly egregious.  If a restaurant wants to add charges like this, they need to advise their customers.  Not doing so is unconscionable.

Finally, the ambiance, if you can call it that, is punishing.  Bootleg is a cavernous room full of hard surfaces, which is overwhelmed with very loud music.  It would be charitable to say that having a conversation is difficult.

If you're dying for Cajun food then Bootleg Special has you covered, but prepare to pay for it in more ways than one."
68,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,2/16/2022,"Great ambience, excellent food! Cocktails were pretty good too! Garlic noodles def try"
69,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,8/20/2021,"The outside of the restaurant is very misleading. Reason why I say that is because, the entrance has the appearance that the restaurant permanently has closed for business. But when you proceed to enter the building, you walk into a beautiful jazzy looking lounge. Immediately, we were greeted and lead to our seats. The waitress was very nice and explained everything, on the menu that we had questions about. As I sit here thinking about how to write this review. I decided to just be as simple as possible. If I was to explain everything in detail, it would be waaay to long. So here I go.. Bootleg is a bit pricey, you'll notice that right away. But you will soon realize, every penny spent was well worth it. The quality and the quantity of the entree's was huge. Every dish (Build your own, momma sue boil, garlic noodles and shrimp, and scallop tacos) ordered was delicious. The complimentary bread provided was great for sauce dipping. I wouldve liked a little less garlic in the entree's though. I would come back here"
70,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,3/6/2021,Delish!!! We had the garlic noodles with shrimp as an appetizer and it was to die for! I am impressed! Out waitress was very nice and the guests were friendly!
71,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,3/11/2021,"Walking in to Bootleg Special, you know you are getting ready for a good time! The music, the artwork, the vibe in general puts you in a good mood. 

The food was also pretty good! We ordered a lot of small plates to share as well as a custom seafood boil. Personally, the seafood boil was pretty average to me and nothing special but the garlic noodles, the chicken wings, and the Mac and cheese were delicious! I definitely recommend coming here with a group to order a bunch of sharing items."
72,Bootleg Special,2 star rating,8/28/2021,"Thanks to TikTok & Yelp - I thought this would be a dope spot to check out while staying in Boston for the weekend. Dishes looked well proportioned, vibe was cool, etc. 

Walking in - aesthetically pleasing. Speakeasy vibes. 
Service - good. Waitress was cool. 
Food - IF YOU ARE HUNGRY THIS AINT THE SPOT.
If ya coming to just catch up and kick it w/friends, chat over some food. This is for could be for you. The dishes were super small compared to what I viewed online. The food did NOTHING for my appetite. We ordered 'social plates' // grilled octopus, easy street corn, & lobster/crab mac. Don't get me wrong everything ordered was good. Just didn't even make a dent in either of our appetites. 

So in all I have 2 stars cause it was alright. 
Wasn't as hyped as the internet made it seem."
73,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/23/2022,I LOVE Bootleg Special.  The food is amazing and the vibe is totally cool.  Its my new Boston favorite!
74,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,9/5/2021,"There are not enough stars to give. My wife and I went for brunch today and I wanted to lick my plate and my wife's. Hell, I looked at the next table and considered licking their plate, but you know, COVID... and decorum. We had the bootleg eggs Benedict and it was the most amazing thing ever. The bananas foster soufflé pancakes were just as good. 

This place is a must go to..."
75,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,4/19/2021,This place is really cool. Definitely a younger and hipper vibe but still enjoyable. The music was a bit loud and our food came out in the wrong order. The soufflé pancakes are okay but it's something you can make at home. The egg Benedict was superb.
76,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,12/8/2021,"Great place to eat. I was visiting the area. The atmosphere was great, New Orleans style decor. The food was amazing, great flavor and portion sizes. Would recommend!!"
77,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,9/19/2021,"So this was the 2nd place I was brought to celebrate my birthday and let me tell you - I loved it! From the outside, this looks like an ""inactive"" hole-in-the-wall type of place. I even wondered if they were open. The magic is inside!
Once I walked in, I was quite surprised, decor is very New Orleans-ish - they even have what I think is a ""pretend balcony"" a la NOLA.  
Full bar + seating tables. 
The music was on point. Each bathroom has its own speaker, feeling like you're in your own club in there ( try it). 
From what I 've seen, good for ladies or date nights. 

Why 4 stars you say?
The food was wayyyy too salty and garlicky for me! 
Parking can be difficult to find so plan an extra 30 mins to drive around to park your car if you're driving."
78,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,4/12/2021,Street corn was delicious! Must try. The garlic fries were ok very thin not so flavorful. The beignets were pretty big and was alright. Not enough powdered sugar lol the drinks here were ok too. The bayou was good and the you can't sip with us drink was ok. The music was a bit all over the place which made it a bit confusing to determine a mood/vibe. Definitely NOLA feels with the set up of the restaurant.
79,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,1/29/2022,Nice ambiance great for a sexy date night. Although the garlic noodles will have your breath smelling for days! (Still to die for lol) if you don't like spice don't get the sausage.. the seasoning for the boil is pretty chunky as opposed to being more saucy. Overall good place to satisfy your seafood boil cravings. PARKING SUCKS THO.
80,Bootleg Special,1 star rating,1/29/2022,"The food is absolutely horrible. The place smells like garlic.
The only thing good was the pineapple mojito."
81,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,8/30/2021,"Boston town was booked at most places that were recommended to us so this was a pick from Yelp. A great find as the small plates were so delicious! The garlic fries were thin and delicate, the fish tacos were tasty but a tad bit too spicy  (but I am a wimp in the spice arena) Funky, urban atmosphere."
82,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,12/31/2021,"My boyfriend and I came here on a whim in late 2020 during COVID curfew era. The drinks were delicious and although our server forget the our entire order minus the oysters- we didn't mind! We continued to order more rounds of oysters because we thought our food was coming. We still salivate at the thought of the oysters.. it has quickly become a regular stop for us while in Boston! We have since experienced the rest of their menu over countless seasons and they never disappoint! Most recently, we have fallen for the Birria Bao and Garlic Noodles with Shrimp! Obsessed. Highly recommend!"
83,Bootleg Special,2 star rating,2/5/2022,"READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU GO ......

3 margaritas each for a party of 2 ; oysters + appetizers
( oysters come with 3 per order )

The first set of drinks were 80% ice ; when we asked for less ice with the second order , the drinks came half way full ! Disappointing ....:

One boil a person for dinner totaling a $500.00 TAB

The corn on the cob was still frozen and the garlic was overpowering the crab /lobster .

Atmosphere was nice and yet also empty but for $500 ( without tip ) you could afford to fly to New Orleans round trip and enjoy the real atmosphere they're trying to replicate. You can also book a overnight stay at a hotel while there for the amount of the tip on a $500 tab . 

So not worth it and that is why they're empty ...."
84,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,8/18/2021,"my husband and i had Saturday brunch here recently and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  we ordered a variety of items, all to share, and each were excellent.

we started with the crawfish fried rice, which turned out to be our favorite dish.  it was very well-seasoned and had spice, but wasn't too spicy.  it was expertly fried, and the egg absorbed a lot of the flavor- those were some of my favorite bites.

next up we had the homefries au gratin, and the shrimp and grits.  the homefries were the weakest dish, although the potatoes were well cooked and hot, they were lacking the seasoning that was so delightful in the fried rice.  the shrimp and grits, on the other hand, were perfection.  so creamy and luscious, and the shrimp were cooked beautifully, not at all overdone.  i could have eaten several servings of the grits by themselves.

last up for ""dessert"" were the bananas foster souffle pancakes.  oh my!  the texture is so light and fluffy- these really are a treat.  the fresh banana was a welcome counterpoint to the decadent sauce, and the lightly-sweetened fresh whipped cream brought everything together.

we sat at the bar and had a wonderful experience with our 'tender (Blue- like the color), but really all the staff we encountered were friendly and seemed to appreciate our presence during the bustling service.

if you're in the mood for Cajun, or just really good brunch, i highly recommend Bootleg Special."
85,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,1/14/2021,"This place is truly special just as the name suggests. This hidden gem, is a corner restaurant filled with amazing seafood broil. My friends and I walked in, this place is spacious with a young, chill atmosphere with graffiti paintings on the wall. Surprised that it wasn't as packed as it was. Tables spaced out approximate for covid. Service was fantastic, service wasn't too overbearing but wasn't ghostly, just the right amount of attention. I was a huge fan of their oysters, price was reasonable and oysters were extremely fresh!"
86,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/12/2021,"The ""BOOTLEG SPECIAL"" - 1 1/4 lb Lobster, 1/2 lb each shrimp, crawfish, mussels, clams, corn on the cob, potatoes, andouille sausage (serves 2-3)
 $89
Garlic Noodles + shrimp -  $9 + $6
Street Corn -  $10
B.S. Wings -  $12

So I've literally been dying to try this place!! I love Louisiana so I had to stop by because of the theme. The urban décor was adorable! The ""bootleg special"" was such a huge portion that filled me up immediately. You also have the option to build your own boil. Everything was so tasty & flavorful!! I also had their garlic noodles & street corn, which are perfect for appetizers. The garlic noodles are legit amazing. I love garlic, so I definitely understand why it's a signature dish. This dish is packed with garlic & lots of butter. I just wish the portion size was bigger, but I enjoyed it regardless.

The street corn is delicious, but more spice would've really given that kick! The wings are crispy & tasty! They're covered with this type of Korean sauce, so if you're into that you should try them.

From the outside, you would never guess the appearance of the interior. I always appreciate the vintage wall art. They have different types of music playing in the background, while there are projectors showing video clips or sports games. It's just an all around nice vibe. Can't wait to come back for brunch!

Parking: Street metered parking - not busy on the weekdays

COVID-19 Safety Precautions: Distance between tables, staff wore masks & had cleaning protocol."

We ordered the seafood boil and added other items to it! The food was fresh and delicious. It was a birthday and dessert came out with a candle on it! It was a great Sunday lunch!"
88,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"OMG.  Finally got to try this place and it was so worth it.  I was in such a happy place dining at Bootleg Special.  Everything we had was amazing... it was well worth the garlic burps I had all day after. Lol.  You can order their boil or go a la carte, which is what we did cause we didn't want the fillers like corn and potatoes.  Since we only ordered snow crab legs, clams, and mussels, it also brought the price down.  The seafood boil was flavorful and the bootleg sauce had just the right amount of kick to it.  I didn't think poutine could get any better but wait, you add gumbo!  The garlic noodles seem simple but is full of flavor.  Until I can get back to NOLA, this will be my spot.  So looking forward to going back to try the soufflé pancakes and beignets."
89,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,8/8/2021,Absolutely superb food! This is definitely one of my mew favorite places and I am picky. Sooo good!
