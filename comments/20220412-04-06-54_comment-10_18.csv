0,Piattini,5 star rating,2/2/2022,"I finally got a chance to check this place out! I called a week ahead to make reservations for my party of 4 on a Friday night. The ambience was nice and the lightening wasn't too dark which I appreicated. 

We ordered two plates of the Black Truffle Ravoli, Scampi, and Salmon. We also ordered some wine, too. The food was super tasty with a lot of flavor and the price wasn't too bad either. I would definitely come back again for the food and to try more wine flights."
1,Piattini,3 star rating,4/9/2022,"Cali Wow turned into a Cali why salad.
Asked for the bold red they brought a glass of merlot. 
Nice outdoor eating area."
2,Piattini,4 star rating,12/5/2021,"I ordered the fusilli pesto and a wine flight. I highly recommend both. I'm not the biggest wine drinker so I don't have a go-to favorite wine. The wine flight was perfect for me since I could try a few sips of 3 different wines rather than having to commit to one glass of a wine I may or may not like, and in my opinion it was a good deal. 

The pasta dish was also really good. I was craving pesto and this hit the spot for sure!"
3,Piattini,2 star rating,4/9/2022,"Super long wait times. Not just for my table, but the other tables around me as well. Â  Poor experience, especially for the price. The table next to me waited over and hour for two salads :-("
4,Piattini,2 star rating,10/25/2021,"I was really looking forward to enjoying this restaurant, but unfortunately the environment completely overshadowed the food. We decided to wait 45 minutes on the waitlist and we were seated outside on the sidewalk. It was a lovely area and felt nice at first, but we were left sitting in the cold for over an hour waiting for our food! The temperature was in the high 40s and dropping, and we didn't have a heater near our table. I understand that their kitchen may be backed up, but an extra heater for the tables around us is definitely doable. The minute we finished our meal, our waiter came out with a new propane tank to make the closest heater to us stronger. Great timing! 

Overall, the food was about 3.5/5. It was quite expensive but the portion sizes were plentiful. Unfortunately our food got cold within 5 minutes of finally getting it out. Atmosphere on the sidewalk was a 2/5."
5,Piattini,4 star rating,9/20/2021,"I called and made reservations on a busy night. I had been to 2 restaurants in the area that said they were at capacity, so I was very pleased to be able to get an intimate table here.

The service was excellent, although a little slow but it was very busy. Our food was fresh and delicious, and I was very pleased by the meal. I believe the servers were doing the best they could while everywhere was packed to capacity. 

Shrimp scampi was great, and lamb chops & mac were very good. I'll try Piattini again in the future."
6,Piattini,5 star rating,3/15/2022,Great prices for being on Newbury street. Affordable and delicious! Cute patio dining perfect to stop at after a day of shopping.
7,Piattini,5 star rating,3/6/2022,"This is a great restaurant! The staff was very friendly and they brought out our food quickly! Delicious food and a nice location both make this a wonderful place to dine! Bread, spaghetti, chicken parmigiana, are all amazing!"
8,Piattini,3 star rating,6/19/2021,"We ordered a salad and a flight of wine. The salad promised a bit more than it delivered, being called ""cauliwow"". In the end it was more of a salad bar salad with corn and marinated cauliflower thrown in. 

The flight of wine was fun and unusual. 

Outdoor dining on newbury st makes up for most culinary sins, explaining the 4 star review."
9,Piattini,1 star rating,10/23/2021,"Update: hi Josephine, thank you for your prompt response. Here are my thoughts:

1. I wasn't aware of the garlic bread as it was not on the menu. But I am pretty sure that we have to order that separately and it doesn't come to the table for free :) 

2. I chose spinach gnocchi because of the good reviews i've seen as well! However it definitely did not meet my expectations. You commented that I should give the restaurant an opportunity to correct it. I did. I asked our waitress to ""reheat"" it because it was cold and hard. They responded super nicely and offered to recook it for me, yet when I got it back it was still cold and stale and I didn't bother to say it a third time especially considering the amount of time we had to wait for our waitress to come over (which I understand, it was busy, but it seemed like other tables around us were being served at a reasonable pace)

3. I was not aware that it was an OPTIONAL FEE as it was directly added onto our bill without my consent. I am not against having kitchen appreciation fee at all, all workers should be respected and appreciated for the hard work they put in. However, like you said, i believe it should be optional depending on the customers' personal experience. But that was not the case for us.

Again, this is my personal experience, which may not reflect other customers experiences here. People have different taste and different expectations for the restaurant. However I believe my personal option based on my personal experience should not be invalidated as ""simply complaining for the sake of complaining"". 

Thank you."
10,Piattini,4 star rating,11/20/2021,"Piattini is creative Italian dining on Boston's lovely Newbury Street. It's a bright & lively atmosphere, albeit a little loud for conversation.

Our dinner was delicious. I enjoyed the Salmon, which had the most amazing sauce. The cauliwow salad was also exceptional. Everyone in my party absolutely loved their meals. 2 of us had ravioli, 1 tried the meatballs & 1 had spaghetti Bolognese. 

The service, while friendly, left a little to be desired. We did feel a little ignored. That being said, it was a really busy Saturday evening. I would still go back, everyone has an off night every so often & the food was well worth it."
11,Piattini,4 star rating,2/8/2022,"Go here for the burrata!! The best appetizer I have ever had: heirloom tomatoes, prosciutto, burrata and fresh bread."
12,Piattini,2 star rating,7/1/2021,"This place may get lots of accolades but don't be fooled. My friend & I went to celebrate our birthdays & what a disappointment. The menu has small lettering so hard to read in such darkness. The service here is slow as anything, super inattentive which is not ok. We had to have to ask for water & bread multiple times which is pretty basic to make sure customers have. He checked on us only once towards the end, we had to flag him down the other times & he passed by our table all the time to get to his other tables & the kitchen. There is no reason for two people to have to sit around for that long & not be taken care of, it was like we were invisible. 

The staff come in from waiting on tables outside & then throw the dirty dishes very loudly into a tub that was only a few ft from us & it was super loud, unprofessional, & annoying. We basically had a 2+ hr meal which was salad & dessert. This whole place is loud, like more than it should be & it was such bad acoustics my friend had to adjust her hearing aid to try to hear me w/out the background noise. So no I won't go back & don't think you should bother."
13,Piattini,3 star rating,3/15/2022,"Came here on a whim with my friend. We ordered a pizza and bolognese. The pizza was enjoyable, and both the toppings and crust were good. On the other hand, the pasta in the bolognese was so overcooked and tasted like my old school lunches... The sauce itself was also just okay. Service wise, we were seated promptly, but the waiter didn't check in at all during the meal. This normally wouldn't have bothered me, but he never came to refill our waters during our meal either and barely looked in our direction so I couldn't even ask for a refill..."
14,Piattini,3 star rating,8/10/2021,"I love right off Newbury so tried this place out for lunch on a Saturday. We went pretty early, around 11am before crowds hit. I ordered the Shrimp Salad and my friend ordered the vegan ravioli. Newbury street is a very expensive street so prices were understandably high here as well. However I was extremely underwhelmed: 

Service: the waiters and hostess basically stand around a gossip and act as if it's an inconvenience to serve you. We had to physically flag the waiter any time we needed something 

Food: I cook quite a bit and the shrimp was extremely odd. For an $18 salad, I expected more than 3 shrimp and honestly I didn't even eat two of them because of an over cooked and stale taste. Super disappointing. The greens were fresh however. My friend did enjoy her ravioli. 

Ambience: it's Newbury street and very cute for people watching so no complaints there. 

Overall just super average and NOTTT worth the price"
15,Piattini,4 star rating,8/10/2021,"My boyfriend and I checked out this place during a trip to Newbury St. because it has the cutest patio area! Really great ambiance for a casual date, friend get together, or even for a lunch break from shopping. 

For cocktails, I ordered the Il Spritzer and my boyfriend ordered the vodka lemonade. The vodka lemonade was so good that I ordered it for my second round. We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer and got the shrimp scampi and burrata pizza as entrees. I would highly recommend the burrata pizza and definitely add prosciutto! The waiter said the shrimp scampi is their most popular dish but for me, it was just so-so. Probably going to order something else next time. 

Overall, it was a great spot and I'd recommend it to anyone in the area!"
16,Piattini,4 star rating,4/8/2021,"This place is definitely on the pricier end but overall pretty satisfied with my meal! The burrata ravioli is a must! The burrata is so creamy and sandwiches the fried eggplant perfectly, and is surrounded by such a rich tasty sauce which was honestly perfect for dipping the complementary bread in. The spinach gnocchi however was a bit heavier and a bit underwhelming; the flavors weren't too special or distinct and the gnocchi was a bit less soft and chewy as I would have preferred. The warm chocolate torta dessert definitely hit the spot though: the chocolate cake was so warm and had a softer center, and was paired so perfectly with the ice cream!!"
17,Piattini,5 star rating,12/17/2021,"Piattini has a really great vibe, great food, and great wine! What really brought me to this place though was the ""impossible"" ravioli - I'd never seen it on any menu before and loved that they had a really interesting vegan option (btw, it was great). I also recommend the wine flight!"
18,Piattini,2 star rating,2/25/2021,"The service was great but unfortunately, the gluten-free options were disappointing.

After walking around Newbury street, my boyfriend and I decided to try out Piattini after seeing they had gluten-free options for both pizza and pasta. If you're gluten-free, you know how hard it can be to find good GF Italian options! Sadly, the pizza and pasta we ordered were not great. 

The gluten-free Margarita pizza was clearly a frozen cauliflower crust, but the problem wasn't the crust, it was that the toppings kept sliding off the pizza. Every time I picked up a slice, the sauce and cheese would simply slide off the crust making it really hard to not only pick up but also enjoy the pizza. 

The gluten-free pasta Bolognese was also disappointing as the gluten-free pasta was overcooked and very chewy. The sauce was also underseasoned. 

Maybe their regular pizza and pasta is better, but when it comes to gluten-free options maybe opt for a different place."
19,Piattini,2 star rating,2/6/2022,"Just ok... I went there for my birthday and was underwhelmed. The service was not worth the ~30 per plate. The red wine was served hot so I had to add a bit of ice so it was drinkable, the waiter did not show us the ticket before checking out, and it felt we had to pay when the waiter came around (as if we were being forced to pay and leave and we had been ther about one hour only). Also, it is shown online as a good wine restaurant but it isn't. The wine selection is not that great and the way they serve wines is as if they don't care that much about the wine aspect of the restaurant. The only plus is that the food prep was fast. There are other Italian places in the northend with much better service and with similar or cheaper prices per plate."
20,Piattini,4 star rating,3/31/2021,"Casual post-work girls night on Newbury? Look no further. Piattini, with a nice outdoor scene (pre-covid as well!), delicious bread/cheese boards, wine selection and sangria, as well as delicious entrees... this is a fantastic place to catch up, watch the hustle and bustle of Newbury street, and feel wined and dined.

Order: Penne with tomato sauce, add grilled chicken (pictured). Also had the bread and cheese board, wine, and sangria."
21,Piattini,5 star rating,10/1/2021,"Food was wonderful had the cheese board and Bolognas over pasta , service was great as well."
22,Piattini,1 star rating,10/23/2021,"Update:
I want to emphasize that during my visit at Piattini, we asked for the waiter for various things like utensils, water, ordering food, and our food MULTIPLE times. And every time, we were either ignored or brushed off as nothing happened afterwards. It was only after I had to physically get up out of my seat and directly request to be served from a waiter who was not in charge of our table.

Also, I doubt that one tiny lemon wedge could turn a shrimp scampi into a full on lemon pasta with bland 1-dimensional flavor. But, maybe your restaurant cannot take any criticism as Piattini only believes any comments/reviews to be unwarranted complaints. 

Additionally, I would like to ask why you assumed that the reviews before me were friends that I dined with. I don't ever recall stating who I dined with, unpess you made some assumptions or stereotypes.

If I had the option, I would give this restaurant a 0 star, but unfortunately, you get a saving grace with an automatic 1 star. Next time, please take your customer's critiques and recommendations seriously before advising us to not complain for the sake of complaining.

If you are thinking of coming to Piattini, I HIGHLY recommend saving your money and sparing your brain cells by going to a different restaurant."
23,Piattini,5 star rating,4/3/2021,"This restaurant was accommodating and nice about our late arrival since we gave them a call beforehand! We sat inside and it was spaced out for COVID measures, but it is still a small place. 
The food came out quickly and the waiter was kind enough to keep giving us bread. The pizzas were delicious and had the right amount of cheese. The ravioli tasted amazing and I definitely recommend it if you love cheese and eggplant. I would go back for dinner again!"
24,Piattini,5 star rating,12/12/2020,"I seldom dine on newbury because I worry I'm paying extra for the restaurant's rent. Went to piattini with three friends and changed my mind. The server, Murthy, was really nice and patient and constantly came over to refill water. Â We ordered the two pasta in the picture. The flavor with the sauce was so good- we both liked it a lot. The brunch portion was actually perfect. Will go again."
25,Piattini,5 star rating,8/5/2021,"Gray restaurant on Newbury street, have had the pleasure of taking out from this establishment a couple of times during the pandemic and have always had consistently delicious results. My go to favorite is their arugula salad with blackened salmon or shrimp. Their greens are always fresh and plentiful and their dressing brings all the components together very well. I also recommend their mushroom, pepper and artichoke pizza - fantastic! Will certainly be coming back."
26,Piattini,5 star rating,1/8/2022,"We ordered 3 piattini between 2 people and it was the perfect amount of food. We got the burrata, muscles and spinach gnocchi. Not gonna lie, the bottom of my plate had so many different sauces and juices that using the bread as a mop was the best move all the night. The muscle juice with a little bit of cheese and pesto created a sweet medley in my mouth. On the other hand they put us in the corner and we had a reservation but hey you don't get to pick your seat. Pre dinner bread was solid and the food came out quickly which is always a bonus."
27,Piattini,5 star rating,10/23/2020,Wow wow wow wow wow !!! Really good mix of flavors! My boyfriend and I went with 3 small plates and one big plate... it was more than enough food! So many bright colors and fantastic sauces. We could have done without the mussels but the sauce and bread really proved them to be a good choice. The lobster ravioli is a MUST. Everything was so delicious and our waitress was wonderful. The outdoor seating expansion does wonders and it's so nice on a good night! They just got heat lamps today-- great purchase!
28,Piattini,5 star rating,9/27/2021,"Food was amazing! Would definitely go there again. No complaints at all. Also, their outdoor seating area was so cute. Got the full Boston experience."
29,Piattini,2 star rating,11/18/2020,"Meh. Piattini came highly recommended by several guidebooks as well as Yelp, but I was highly underwhelmed when my friend and I had a quick lunch here after wandering the area. The Newbury Street tax is really something. 

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. We were seated promptly on the patio - sunny, warm fall day - and distancing safety precautions were all taken. Our server was friendly, and the food came out promptly. However, I found the food to be just okay and the price wasn't worth it. 

I had the shrimps scampi, which was fine - rather light on the shrimp and the flavor, especially for the $16 price tag (y'all know pasta costs like $.30 per serving, right?) but it did the job. I also ordered a glass of prosecco, which was pretty middle-bottom-shelf stuff. It was also fine. The whole experience, with tax and tip, ran me $35 for a plate of okay pasta and a glass of cheap bubbly. 

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, or should have come for dinner, or should have expected it from a Newbury Street spot. Â Still, as someone who values, um, value when dining out, Piattini just wasn't worth it. Grab a sandwich somewhere and save your pennies for a real Italian meal in the North End instead."
30,Piattini,4 star rating,10/28/2020,"Really yummy dishes! All were very tasty but pretty overpriced in my opinion for ~ $25 vegetarian entrees. I'd understand the higher price if they have meet. The gnocchi is an appetizer actually and cheaper but for a similar price, so would recommend."
31,Piattini,1 star rating,3/28/2021,"I'll start by saying that I love the food here (as you can see from my previous review). However, my most recent experience has ensured that I will likely not be coming back.

The restaurant staff today was absurdly inattentive and scattered. Other reviewers have mentioned their great service and I previously have also had positive experiences when I dined here where I felt respected and well attended to. I don't know if my poor service today was because my party was a younger group (and perhaps this somehow meant we were less deserving of their time and attention?) or because it was a busy day for them and the staff was stretched thin; possibly a combination of the two. One of the plates we were given with our complimentary bread was dirty so we asked for a new one, which was never brought to us. While waiting for our food, another waiter came by (unprompted) and asked if we were ready for the check, and I heard a waiter tell another table that he would check on their food for them, only for them to reply that they hadn't gotten the chance to order yet. We received our food in a very reasonable amount of time, which I appreciated, but once we received it, our server was missing for the next 30 minutes. None of the staff dropped by our table to refill our waters (glasses were empty within the first 5 minutes), ask how our food was, or check if we needed anything within the entire period we were eating. The first time someone finally did swing by our table, we were ready for the check. 

While we were eating, my table was also harassed by a passerby from the sidewalk (we were dining on the outdoor patio), who came up to our table (within 4 feet) and loudly/repeatedly yelled at us to share our food with him. This went on for at least a good 20-30 seconds, and needless to say it was an uncomfortable experience. As a party with two women, and given the recent surge in occurrences of anti-Asian violence across the country (I am an Asian female), I felt very unsafe. Given that we were seated no more than 10 feet from both the hostess station and the entrance to the restaurant, I find it surprising that no one from the staff noticed or stepped in to protect their customers from being harassed. Though the incident itself was by no means Piattini's fault, I felt their failure to intervene, either because they didn't care to or because they were so inattentive to their customers that they didn't notice (neither of which reflects well), was disappointing. 

Though I think the food here is wonderful, I can't justify coming when the service is so lacking and there are so many other restaurants around Newbury St and Boston that are of similar price and quality."
32,Piattini,4 star rating,5/16/2021,"Lots of outdoor seating, and turnaround between ordering and food arriving was super fast! Fusilli pesto was super fresh and scampi had the tenderest shrimp. Ordered the melanzane starter at the waitstaff's recommendation; while I understand how it could be one of their bestsellers, I personally found that the truffle was pretty overwhelming."
33,Piattini,4 star rating,12/5/2021,"Best shrimp scampi ever! The service was warm and flexible, accommodating a request to move when the person near us had too much perfume. The food was incredible we will be back!"
34,Piattini,1 star rating,2/24/2022,Service was terrible. Took way too long for waitresses to attend us. Food was grossly average for the price. When splitting up the bill I tried explaining to my friend the split of money and the waitress shushed me because she thought it was unnecessary. Shouldn't have left a tip. Don't come here.
35,Piattini,1 star rating,11/23/2021,"Really really awful. I haven't had such bad experience for a long time. The pizza dough is really bad, no resilience at all. We had two ravioli as well, black truffle one is ok but not good, lobster ravioli is terrible, what I had is terribly fishy, really really fishy, and the lobster flesh taste like frozen dead lobster meat. Really terrible."
36,Piattini,5 star rating,12/4/2021,"Great food, wonderful location on Newberry Street. Staff was accommodating, not super friendly, but nice enough."
37,Piattini,5 star rating,2/15/2020,"Spinach gnocchi is of the best I've had in Boston and I live in the North End. Wonderful pesto sauce and perfectly cooked gnocchi. 

Highlight might have been dessert though. Beautiful presentation and even better tastes. Tried both the Flourless Chocolate Cake and the Hazelnut Gelato Torta...could not say or spell it for the life of me BUT unbelievable. Together the two were extremely filling but worth it. 

Think I preferred the Flourless Cake just a bit more. Warm, rich chocolate cake with a creamy vanilla bean gelato topping that melts into the cake. So GOOD. Will be thinking about this one for a while (:"
38,Piattini,5 star rating,7/1/2021,"Worth a visit. Friendly staff, excellent food, nice decor, ok wine, and amazing deserts. In fact, the Tiramisu is better than what we've had in Italy."
39,Piattini,5 star rating,1/12/2021,"I love this restaurant!!! My boyfriend and I walked into this hole in the wall Italian spot immediately taken by the ambiance. The cozy, low lit interior with candles sprinkled throughout made for such a romantic vibe. Â 

When we sat down, we were greeted by the kindest, most accommodating waiter who set the mood by joking around with us and helping us pick out our meal for the night. The food was absolutely amazing, from the complementary bread... fluffy and light, the cheese plate, the burrata ravioli and shrimp scampi... alive with richness and flavor, and the chocolate cake dessert. Had the most fun night here, and the dishes we chose were so masterfully created."
40,Piattini,2 star rating,11/17/2021,"Ambiance was strange, there was also an unpleasant odor of some sort throughout the restaurant...

Food was just ok, could have been MUCH better. Â Especially for the price."
41,Piattini,4 star rating,2/17/2022,"I love this cozy restaurant for outdoor dining sitting on the lower level of Newbury Street. Â I have been going here for years ever since I moved to Boston. Â The salads, pastas, sandwiches, and sangria are always spot on. Â Now that my daughter is a freshman in college attending in the city, I love taking her and her roommate out for dinner or lunch. Staff is exceptional as well. Hidden gem!"
42,Piattini,4 star rating,11/19/2020,"Still open on Newburyport for lunch and dinner. We sat outside with a propane heater and had great service and food. Glad they're still going and still kickin the mezzalune affumicate, their original signature dish with perfectly done fried eggplant, melted cheese sandwiches between with truffled tomato cream sauce. Yum."
43,Piattini,5 star rating,10/24/2021,"I'm surprised at some of the other reviews because we had a wonderful experience at Piattini! In town for the marathon, and the restaurant was extremely busy. We did have reservations and they initially seated us in the dining area near the kitchen. We requested a different table, and they were very nice and accommodated our request. Our server was great!! Our waters were constantly filled, he responded quickly when we had questions, and he was professional yet personable! AND the food was amazing!! We started by sharing the arugula salad. So glad we shared it because it was generous enough for two! Loved the combo of caramelized beets, butternut squash, and cheese. SO good!! We then enjoyed the veal secondi (my hubby) and the mussels (me!). The veal was very tender and delicious!! Yes, he spared a bite for me :o). My mussels were fresh with tomatoes, wine, garlic, and herbs, served with ciabatta. Â They were wonderful!! I needed carbs for the marathon, so I had also ordered a half order of the homemade fusilli with pesto and wild mushrooms. YUUUMMMM!!!! I've never had such delicious homemade pasta! It was so tender! Had to skip dessert because we were so full, but if I run Boston again we will definitely come here for another delicious meal!"
44,Piattini,4 star rating,9/4/2021,"Came here on a rainy night while helping sister move in to a new apartment. Surprised there wasn't any bread to gnaw on while we went over the menu. Started with the Cremini pizza as an appetizer, which was great. I could've eaten the whole thing, but I rarely feel the need to eat pizza at Italian places like this. I went with the FRUTTI DI MARE with the red sauce, and loved it. I don't often go for seafood, but it was the most appealing option at the moment. Winded down the meal with the tiramisu, which was amazing. Washed it all down with LONG TRAIL GREENBLAZE IPA. Everyone else loved their meals too. A great time overall."
45,Piattini,4 star rating,6/15/2021,"Pretty delicious food! Fairly expensive. I was happy to see that they had some delicious vegan options! Unfortunately the portion size wasn't too big, and the price was on the more expensive side of Italian food. The vegan options truly were so tasty however, and I'd go back again in a heartbeat if it weren't for the price! Not sure if they were just busy, but the wait staff took a very long time between things, which in all was not a terrible issue. Atmosphere was still very cute for a date night :)"
46,Piattini,5 star rating,2/1/2022,Amazing!! Me & my bfs favorites spots to go to when we are in town!! Can't wait to have it again
47,Piattini,1 star rating,6/24/2021,"We sat down at an outdoor table for two and I promptly shat on by a bird within seconds. Â I should have taken this as a premonition. Â We waited a few minutes for a waiter to come by and explained what had happened and if we could have a napkin (probably should have been on the table to begin with). With shit on my neck I watched as he proceeded to go take orders from a few other tables before making his way back inside. Â Another 5 minutes and he was out with our napkins and said he would be back to take our order shortly. Â 

We proceeded to wait an additional 25 minutes before seeing his face again as he resurfaced to attend to the tables around us. Â Trying to get his attention each time it was another 10 minutes before we could flag him down. Â So we are now at 40 minutes sitting down before we are able to get a drink order in. Â Understanding the situation that has been bestowed upon us we decide to order our drinks and food together (not knowing when the next time we might see him is). Â I order a beer and my girlfriend orders a bottle of Prosecco in addition to two salads .

After another 10 minutes of waiting I am able to flag him down and order another beer. Â If the first one takes more than 10 minutes I should surely put my name in the queue for the next one. Â 

The drinks come shortly after that. Â We are brought 1 bottle of Prosecco, 2 bottles of beer and 1 beer glass. Â No issue right? Â Except immediately after dropping of the drinks he disappears again. Â After waiting almost an hour for our drinks we are left with a bottle of Prosecco that was not opened for us nor were we provided glasses to drink it out of. Â I laughed and considered myself the lucky one for a brief moment for ordering a beer. A very brief moment. Â These beers were not in fact twist offs. Â Our waiter had left us here with an unopened bottle of Prosecco with no glasses and two unopened beers. Â I have never been stranded deserted island but I am starting to appreciate the feeling. Â Fortunately I keep a bottle opener on my keychain so I am prepared for situations like these.

We do not see our waiter for a while but eventually he does come back with two wine glasses for our Prosecco. Â We would be responsible for opening the bottle of Prosecco though.

Shortly after downing my first beer our food comes out. Â Not just the salads but the entrees too. Â Can you believe how lucky we are to get two plates of food all at once while our tiny table now has 2 bottles of beer, a bottle of Prosecco, and a 2nd bread basket (which we had to pay extra for for fear of starvation at that point). Â Talk about ambiance. Â 

We eat for the next 20 minutes without anyone checking in to ask how it is or if we would like anything else. Â As we are winding down I flag down the waiter for our check. Â When he comes back I just hand over my card to expedite the process. Â No need to look it over and risk him leaving for an indefinite period of time. Â When he returns my excited cannot be understated. Â I am free. All I have to do is sign my name, pack up my things, and head home after a dissapointing evening. Â That feeling although powerful is too good to be true. Â There is no pen. Â Of course there is no pen. Â Why would there be a pen? Â Have I learned nothing about this establishment over the past hour and a half. Â 

After another indefinite period of time I am able to flag him down and I am able to obtain a pen. Thank the Lord. Â 

I have never left less than 20% tip at any restaurant for any reason. Â That is for the minimum service and it is usually higher. Â Tonight I left Zero dollars and I do not regret it for one second. Â That was not just the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant but one of the worst experiences I have had period. Â There are hundreds of restaurants in walking distance of this place and while I have not been to every one I would be confident in recommending any of them over this place.

49,Piattini,5 star rating,1/26/2022,"Lovely restaurant, very good food, excellent service. Â Highly recommend. Â Wish I took photos to post. Â Will next time. Outdoor dining nice when weather is good but can be a bit crowded."
50,Piattini,3 star rating,10/26/2021,The food was okay when my friends and I decided to have some vegetarian friendly pasta. The service was very slow. I think it took about 30-40 mins to get our food on what seemed to be like a non busy evening
51,Piattini,4 star rating,8/29/2021,Had a good meal here last night. Â Service was good too. My only complaint is that we sat in the large back room. Â The noise and music were extremely loud because there is no sound absorbing material on the walls or ceiling. Â This needs to be added ASAP to make dinning more comfortable. It was very hard to talk.
52,Piattini,4 star rating,10/17/2021,"Food was pretty good. I kind of feel like it's just another Downtown Boston-located Italian food place - decent, but not amazing. I wish they had more menu options, as well. I did enjoy their cheeseboard! Also got the tuna tartar appetizer and spinach gnocchi, both of which were decent."
53,Piattini,4 star rating,5/22/2019,"This is a great Italian place right in downtown Boston, specifically Back Bay area. I personally really enjoyed my experience there. The space has a nice ambiance. They can offer more intimate, personal dining experience for dates or for large parties alike. The waitresses were polite and efficient. They greeted you, asked nicely if we had any reservation, brought out the food promptly for everyone in your dining party..and take care of my requests you have.

The food is also just as good. Even for lunch, we found the portion size to be good..and with great prices, too (pasta dishes for lunch go for $11-15..not bad at all!). Everyone in our dining party enjoyed the meal. I had their lobster ravioli ($13) and thought the portion was just right. It was on a light lunch side...but definitely kept me satisfied through remaining of the day. Their other pasta dishes like angel hair or spaghetti seemed to be more filling though..so if you are hungry..you may want to go for that..or pick a pasta dish and another appetizer or two...and you will be satisfied.

I definitely want to stop by Piattini again in the future. But I will also want to make sure I RSVP ahead of going there for sure. Their space isn't too big..so if you want a nice Italian place in Back Bay...save on a potential headache and make a reservation ahead of time!"
54,Piattini,5 star rating,4/25/2021,"The restaurant had a great vibe to it. A wonderful menu, not overly long but made up of many interesting options. I love cauliflower crust on the pizza option. Â The mussels were out of this world. 

Lots of outdoor dining. Â Nice back room which can be rented out."
55,Piattini,1 star rating,4/25/2021,"I don't like to write bad reviews, but this one I had to give it a 1 star for the poor customer service. Yesterday, my friend and wanted pizza so we happened to pass by this restaurant that offered it. We didn't book a reservation beforehand, as it looked very packed for outdoor dining. I immediately asked the hostess what would be the wait time for a table of 2. She said she could actually seat us right away. 

When we got to our table, we noticed we were seated to a tiny table that was right next to the crowded pathway of the street. Many onlookers were very close to us, so we wondered if it was possible to switch to another table (covid precaution: wanted to be safe). We had kindly asked our waiter if it was possible to sit at the table across that was a bit bigger for us both and won't be near the crowd, he told us ""yes, of course."" However, right after we moved, the hostess came back up to our table with a upset look and told us we cannot move to the other table: assuming we moved without mentioning to anyone. Right in front of everyone, the hostess mentioned how we were pissing other customers off who are on the reservation list and we couldn't just move because this was a table of 4 and were are 2. We were so confused by this altercation because we had asked the waiter beforehand and he mentioned yes, so the hostess put the blame onto us, thought we started it, and thought we made a scene when we never did. We apologized anyways and moved back but still were confused as to her being upset and annoyed at us. We looked around and saw 2 people sitting at bigger tables but we didn't want to question any further. I noticed our waiter felt really bad for us after and kept apologizing.

The food was another issue that upset us a lot. I've never waited for my food for almost 2 HOURS. I don't know how I even had the patience to wait for 2 hours. Our bread already came an hr late. My friend and I were confused as to why the people around us who came AFTER us had their food first, some even finished before our food even came. My mimosa I ordered, I finished way before our food came (possibly a half hr before). Our waiter felt very bad again that he kept going back and forth and questioning his team where our food was. We didn't question it because we didn't want to make it seem or have the hostess think that ""we're creating a fuss again"" so we just waited. But at that point, we were just very upset by everything. 

Go here if you want, but just heads up the service not that great. Foods just alright. Not sure if it was just a busy, nice hot weekend. But I've NEVER had customer experience in Newbury St like that before..."
56,Piattini,5 star rating,11/18/2019,"Had the best solo lunch here! 

Was traveling in Boston on business and just needed to have some alone time. It was around 2 or 3pm when I decided to stop at Piattini due to a recommendation to try the gnocchi from a vegetarian friend. I took a seat outside and was serviced very amicably and efficiently.

I ordered a cafe latte and the spinach gnocchi as per my friends recommendation. The temperature at the time was very comfortable and the comforting food added to the overall feeling of relaxation and contentment. A little bird even came to sit on my table and tried to steal an entire slice of complimentary bread! Though the bread was much too heavy for it.

That gnocchi was great. And so was the service. Will definitely be back in the warmer months to enjoy people and bird watching in their outdoor seating section."
57,Piattini,2 star rating,8/27/2021,"I'm new to the city...but if you're a city with a reputation for Italian food your Italian food better be good. It was not good. Service pretty much ignored us flat out and they never checked on us. Cocktail wasn't bad though, and the pizza was edible. It just tasted more ""Dominos"" than ""$17"". I will be ordering Dominos over this"
58,Piattini,5 star rating,4/7/2019,"This is my first time in Boston. I had asked the concierge where he recommended that was close by and he gave me a list of three restaurants but said that Piattini was his ultimate favorite! And I love Italian, so decided to give it a try! 

When I arrived there, it was quite crowded, so I knew it must be good. Luckily, for a Saturday night, the wait for a table of 2 was only 15 minutes! (I was expecting to have to wait longer!) 

Looking over the menu, I spotted a wine flight section and decided to try that out! I got the fruttoso rosso flight and they were all delicious!! 

For my main, I ordered the kale pesto pasta. It came with roasted red peppers and grape tomatoes. I was a bit unsure of how I would like kale pesto, but I'm so glad I tried it because I LOVED it!! Would 100% order again! 

I had looked over the dessert menu and everything sounded so good, but I was too full and had to pass. 

Our waiter was amazing as well. He provided his recommendations and was very attentive to anything that we might have needed!

If you're new to Boston, or a lifer, I highly recommend trying this place out!"
59,Piattini,1 star rating,10/10/2021,I was absolutely speechless. I'm usually someone who is not picky about their food at all. This was the most bland and cold pasta I have ever eaten. I saw the reviews and decided to go but I was extremely disappointed. The service was terrible as the waiter only visited our table twice. Since there were so many fees involved I thought I would get better service but that wasn't the case. I never even got my water refilled. The plates were dirty and we had to ask for replacements. Three medium sized meatballs were $14 and it tasted like very bad college dining hall food. I do not recommend this place at all. Please reconsider the price is NOT worth it unfortunately.
60,Piattini,1 star rating,10/10/2021,"Bad food and a lot of hidden fees. If you come here, expect to pay overpriced bad food and expect to have to ask a waiter three times before you can get anything solved. Kitchen appreciation fee also included for unseasoned, bland food. Save ur wallet and tongue."
61,Piattini,4 star rating,7/9/2021,"This place is great I sat inside and the best thing about this place was the service I got from our waitress. She refilled our waters everytime it was empty. The quality of the food was alright, but I thought the dishes were a little bit expensive. Inside was small I wish I sat outside instead because it felt tight for a party of 5 in doors"
62,Piattini,1 star rating,5/21/2021,"Having arrived 3 minutes after confirming a table outside, we were ushered inside, (Strike 1) where the music was so unbearable the other patrons had to shout at one another to be heard. Â Our waiter, was very helpful, and kindly offered to lower the music but it didn't make that much of a difference. 

Sadly, the food didn't compensate for the ambiance. I knew we were in trouble when the burrata appetizer was absolutely tasteless. How do you ruin burrata??? By the time the mains came we were hoping for a better result. Regrettably it seems the chef has lost his tastebuds, or the kitchen has run out of seasoning. Maybe a little SALT would be a nice addition to the repertoire. As I looked at all of our meals, they were prepared in the same haphazard manner. All the plates were drenched in sauce, probably to disguise the lack of flavor. Â 

I have to warn you, this is probably the worst restaurant I have been to in Boston. Â I will never set foot in there again.Go to Serafina, across the street. If you can't get in there's a Shake Shack two doors down, You'll have a better experience."
63,Piattini,4 star rating,8/28/2021,"Piattini is a nice little place on Newbury street. Compared to the location, the prices are quite cheap and the portions are big they have pastas and pizzas for mains primarily, we've only had pasta when visiting. Service is attentive and fast. Bolognese is my favourite. A bit underrated, don't let the cheap prices scare you away. You get value for money!! We're coming back regularly"
64,Piattini,5 star rating,1/2/2021,"Three days later, I am still dreaming of Piattini and their black truffle ravioli! Possibly the best pasta I have had in years. My husband and I found this spot on Yelp and it is a must go to in Boston. Our server was great and disclosed to us that it was his first day - luckily we could not tell! Great spot."
65,Piattini,5 star rating,7/31/2020,"I absolutely love Piattini. One of my go to places in Back Bay for Italian food. Great outdoor seating on Newbury street. Literally everything here is sooooo delicious. Â I highly recommend any dish that has pesto in it, you cannot go wrong! 

Our favorite waiter is Maximo!! He is kind, helpful, hilarious and extremely personable. If you get him as your server, it will be a treat! This was our second time having him as a server and he gave us a tiramisu on the house. Â 10/10!

Food: Food was fine but WAYYYYY too overpriced. All of the dishes we ordered were vegan/vegetarian and the plate average was about $20 which is ridiculous when there's no meat. We got the vegan bolognese, the vegan ravioli, and the pesto pasta with mushrooms. I've had better pesto pasta at Panera. Save your money or go to the North End.

Ambiance: The lighting was quite dim (contrary to the photos taken). Weird hospital-esque white lighting that created a strange, vaguely unenjoyable ambiance. Also, not sure if this was a stylistic choice but there's a huge photo of a face printed on the wall next to us. I guess it added to ""the vibe"" but it was still really weird to eat food while a giant face was staring at us."
67,Piattini,1 star rating,7/5/2021,Service is non existing. Food is awful. Noise level inside is off the charts. Don't waste your time.
68,Piattini,5 star rating,3/11/2021,"The best customer service in Boston. The staff is wonderful. Further, the food is delicious and moderately priced. I love love love this restaurant."
69,Piattini,5 star rating,11/28/2021,"Went here for dinner with some girlfriends, the place is very cozy and nice. The food was amazing and so were the drinks. Incredible staff, I would definitely come back here."
70,Piattini,4 star rating,11/2/2018,"PROS:
- Wonderful staff. The hostess and our waitress were friendly.
- Good cocktail menu
- Looking at the food menu, I could tell this place knows its ingredients. Everything looked really tempting. It was hard to choose just one haha
- Large portions for the pasta so I feel like the slightly higher pricing that puts some people off is very understandable. Also, please consider the fact that you're eating at Newbery St. so of course the restaurants around here will be a bit pricier.

CONS:
- Make reservations! It's a popular restaurant at a popular location so it's quite busy. Never hurts to plan ahead :)
- Small space. We sat at the table for 2 right in front of the door on the side of the kitchen. It was a pretty small space with lots of people walking by since it's a busy restaurant. Not too stuffed that we felt uncomfortable though.

SPECIFICS:
- Penne Con Zucca = Pasta was cooked perfectly. The gorgonzola cheese was beautifully melted and pulled into strings with each forkful. The squash was cooked into a nice tenderness while keeping its texture. Chicken was nice and tender too, not too dry. Only needed a tad of salt to balance out the sweetness of the squash but it's a simple fix. 

OVERVIEW: 
Would come back again to give some of their enticing menu items a try. Make reservations ahead of time."
71,Piattini,3 star rating,6/11/2021,"Ok but not on par with the neighborhood for the price. 

Check your receipt too. What we were charged did not match the website or printed menu."
72,Piattini,5 star rating,5/14/2021,Huge portions! The mushroom truffle ravioli was really rich and flavorful. The ravioli was quite stuffed which was delicious. Definitely would come back and they had very nice outdoor seating.
73,Piattini,5 star rating,5/11/2021,Delicious bolognese! The gnocchi was very tasty as well. Lamp chops were seasoned well. Great place for a quick snack on Newbury street. Service was attentive and friendly.
74,Piattini,5 star rating,5/9/2021,"I decided to give this place a second chance tonight, and boy am I happy I did! I got the eggplant app and pesto dinner. Both were great! Sangria was good too! Huge outdoor patio. My only wish is that it wasn't extra money for extra bread, but it is what it is."
75,Piattini,4 star rating,11/4/2021,"My wife and I had a great experience at Piattini last night. Â We are visiting Boston and found this restaurant while exploring the area near our hotel. Â It was not busy and we felt like we had the place to ourselves. Â Our server, Naina, was great. Â She answered all our questions and was friendly and responsive. Â Our food was delicious and arrived quickly. Â One of our dishes arrived a little salty; we told Naina when she asked us how everything was. The kitchen quickly prepared the dish again and it was perfect. Â Overall, we had a great time and very glad we stopped here."
76,Piattini,3 star rating,2/17/2019,"PROS
- Location, location, location! Right off Newbury Street for hungry shoppers.
- Vegan options! Got the vegan ravioli and they didn't skimp on the veggies.
- Free flow bread but no balsamic vinegar :(
- Cozy atmosphere and patient wait staff
- Lots of local seafood options (lobster ravioli, frutti di mare, etc.)
- lobster ravioli was mixed into a mind-blowing sauce 

CONS
- pricy for its taste, definitely had better Italian food for the same price"
77,Piattini,3 star rating,5/13/2021,Honestly not surprised at the quality. I figured since it's on Newbury the prices wouldn't match the quality. $28 for a seafood pasta dish and it looked something you could throw together yourself for less than $10. Presentation was sloppy as well. Just go to the North End for Italian food! Average tasting food that's pretty expensive. Three stars for the Sangria tho!
78,Piattini,5 star rating,10/25/2021,"It was a nice sunny day on Newbury St, so my partner and I decided to try the outdoor seating. I am pleased that we stumbled upon this little gem. Everything was great - food was delicious and the service was quick."
79,Piattini,4 star rating,7/9/2018,"Great Italian food in a very central, convenient location. My dad, sister, and I made a reservation for a Saturday night about an hour prior and had absolutely no issues. The restaurant didn't seem too crowded at around 6 PM though we were still seated in a cramped back area. It was a beautiful day and an outdoor table would have been nice, but alas. 

To start, we ordered the mussels appetizer (cozze con vino) and found it delicious. This was the highlight of the meal -- so fresh and light, with this perfect toasty bread to match. The mussels were sautÃ©ed with garlic and tomatoes and the whole dish was so flavorful; it brought back memories of coastal Italian weekends from study abroad. 

We then ordered 3 pasta dishes as entrees -- me the boscaiola with fettuccine (prosciutto, green peas, wild mushrooms, tomato cream), my dad the scampi (linguini, tiger shrimp, fresh tomato, lemon white wine), and my sister the fusilli pesto (fusilli, pesto, and wild mushrooms). The buscaiola was FANTASTIC -- the 3 of us were all eating off my plate. The tomato cream sauce was just delectable and the chewiness of the prosciutto paired well with the fettuccine. My dad actually didn't love the scampi though I liked it (tasted super fresh but could have used a little more flavor, in my opinion). My sister's pesto was also good, though not a standout like the others were. 

They also have a decent wine selection and the service was attentive and friendly. Definitely recommend after a long day of shopping!"
80,Piattini,4 star rating,6/6/2018,"Piattini is a full service decent Italian eats in Back bay! Â 

++ Â  Â Ambiance is intimate. Set below the street, inside is split into 2 DRs, one with a full bar and an outdoor patio. Â 

+ Â  Â  Â Food was good but far from authentic Italian. Â Everyone liked their dishes especially lobster ravioli, meatballs and scampi. Â But my chicken squash penne was a little sweet and not al dente as ordered. Â What I really liked was their fig jam from the cheese board, fresh baked bread and fresh arugula (salad was lacking but the greens were fresh). Â  They have a full bar and a good sized wine list too. Â 

++ Â  Â Price is rather reasonable for the overall food, the service and their location.

++ Â  Â Service was very good! Â Attentive and steady throughout the meal. Â 

We walked to the restaurant from our hotel. Â  Parking on or near Newberry is tight street or private lots. Â  

I would revisit Piattini again but order another dish!

81,Piattini,1 star rating,4/24/2021,"Terrible experience!!! My girl and I dined in this evening. To start off, the service was unacceptable. No one initially greeted us. I had to ask for service. Which I understand today was a busy day.... Once I requested service, the waiter who took on the order never showed back up. Which then lead another waiter to finish his work. Also, the icing on the cake was while leaving. No one greeted us by saying. ""Have a goodnight, thank you for coming"". Etc! Food was good service was trash!! Maybe if you want a good experience at Piattini, please eat outside. I believe that's where the focus is at!!"
82,Piattini,5 star rating,4/2/2021,"Me and my friends had dinner there. The service was great! Very fast and polite, the waiter was very attentive. The food was good, I had veggie ravioli"

84,Piattini,4 star rating,9/20/2021,"Nice large patio. Â Friendly staff! Â The lobster ravioli and pesto pastas are excellent. Â They also have great large salads. Â The cream sauce pastas are a bit rich and not as flavorful and my fellow diners did not care for the meatballs, I did not eat them."
85,Piattini,3 star rating,11/9/2019,"Cozy restaurant, but the food and service was generally mediocre. 

The bread given when we first sat down was very cold and tasted alright. The spinach gnocchi was actually very good and I highly recommend it, but the remaining pastas we ordered were also just ok. The chicken in one pasta was dry and seemed like it had been overboiled. The flavor of the sauces was nothing special. All of these made the meal feel overpriced for the quality.

Additionally, our server did not seem to care about our table very much. After offering more bread and telling us he would be right back with it, we never ended up getting a second round of bread. Also, he only appeared at our table to take our order and give us a check. Did not offer us parmesan after we got our pastas, even though every other table around us did receive this service. Thus, it was a pretty mediocre experience and certainly not worth the price."
86,Piattini,4 star rating,2/28/2021,Great place. Warm accommodating staff. Owner is gracious and very friendly. The pizza is excellent and the buratta is top notch. Visit this place today for great indirect dining
87,Piattini,3 star rating,6/26/2019,"3.5*
Fair service, nice food

The owner and server were neither impassioned nor Â impassive. It took me a second to find the entrance of this place. 

I came here since I was recommended to try their spinach Gnocchi. The spinach Gnocchi did fit my taste. Apart from tomato slices, everything in the dish seems to be green. Green cream and green Gnocchi with a little bit of tomato slices dripped in. I personally love the taste of Gnocchi because of its rich flour taste and spinach smell. The food itself worths a 4* rate. 

Considering the overall atmosphere and comparing to restaurants in this area, 3.5* would be the final rate."
88,Piattini,4 star rating,1/11/2018,"Sometimes, you just don't feel like venturing to the North End for Italian food. Sometimes, you just want to be in the back bay, especially after a long day of shopping. Piattini has excellent Italian food, with slightly higher prices than the North End.
We started off with the homemade meatballs, made of beef and pork. They were a good size, and really soft and tender.
I can't resist home made pasta- it is so much better than pasta in a box. The bolognese is made with homemade fusilli- ooh the fusilli was so good. You could tell it was homemade, the shape was different from fusilli in a box. It was topped with ground meat, simply amazing.
I would highly recommend Piattini if you are looking for great Italian food in the Back Bay!"
89,Piattini,5 star rating,9/7/2019,"I rarely get chicken mainly because it's a little boring, but whatever they do to the chicken here has be reconsidering my stance on that, the server talked me into it and glad she did. The chicken I refer to is the Pollo Al Carciofi which I had never heard of before but it really exceeded expectations. 
Also had the burrata app and tomatoes were surprisingly fresh and juicy which was also unexpected.
Decent beer and wine selection although would have loved to see some taps instead of just bottled and cans and clap your hands."
0,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,4/5/2022,"Hands down my favorite bowl of Pho in Boston.

Small Menu with just the essentials. Each item is done beautifully. Plated well, garnished well.

The broth is amazing here. It is so incredibly subtle and deep in flavor. Sure it might not be the most savory or MSG flavored but I really enjoy the complexities of taste in the broth. 

The aesthetic of this restaurant is also beautiful. I visited this restaurant once pre-COVID and was surprised to see the nearly complete transformation. They changed wall decor, tables and have even more plants (which was the main selling point before) 

I love this place and will be back pho more!

-Koh"
1,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/5/2022,"Love this place. Pho is pretty good (probably my second favorite after my favorite spot Sai Gon Dep in NYC), but the grilled rice plates are the best. Both grilled chicken and pork are herbaliviously delicious, and gluten free for this little celiac. 

The vibe of this place is wonderful. It's like a little nature romantic oasis in the middle of Boston, and just so darn cute. Plants and flowers everywhere and the gnomes!

They also have amazing spring rolls, but the peanut sauce is not Gf so make sure you replace with fish sauce. One thing to note is this place gets BUSY and often have 1-2 servers for a full place, even at odd times like 3 or 4 pm and dishes do take a bit of time to come out, So plan accordingly. We typically get take out which isn't an issue, and place our order, go do something else, and come back after."
2,Saigon Fusion,1 star rating,1/20/2022,"They don't care about customers at all.
Called them after their open time, which is 11 am according to yelp and google) to check if they are open. Yes, I have to call first to check if they are open because they are never on time. I ended up calling them 10 times in 40 minutes, no one picked up the phone. They always do this in terms of their opening hour. Last Sunday, I called and asked what time they're open, they said 12:30 pm while it says 12 on yelp and google. But last time I was lucky that somebody picked up the phone. I guess I'm not really lucky today then.
My friend one time called them to order Pho and the waitress at that time told her the chef was not there (wtf?) so she had to call back after 30 minutes, then she called back again and the chef was still not there. What a ridiculous restaurant! If they don't wanna work, why bother opening a restaurant and treat customers like we are beggars?"
3,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,11/9/2021,"Ordered for take-out. The pork bahn mi sandwich was nicely wrapped and tasted pretty good. Pretty much exactly what I expect...and as always wished it had a little more protein, just like everywhere else I've been. Who couldn't use a little more, right?

We ordered pho from here specifically because the other pho/thai place next door didn't serve take-out in a bowl so we could eat back at the hotel. We were super disappointed that they placed raw meat in the bowl of ingredients. That just doesn't make any sense! That's Food Safety 101 - Cross contamination!!! Cook the meat first or put it in plastic container with the hot soup broth. Â We had to try and cook it in the microwave in the hotel.

No one got sick, but that's not the way I like to experience excitement. Lol."
4,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,9/23/2021,"Honestly wasn't expecting much when I first came in. It's well-decorated but dimly lit. Didn't smell of the typical aromas of Vietnamese restaurants, and the classical music was at EDM volume. Thankfully, the server was so kind to turn it down a couple notches for me! And once the food arrived, all my initial meh feelings went right out the door. Beautifully plated (just look at it!!) and equally delicious. 

Signature Banh Mi - WOW. The pulled chicken has such a unique flavor. The ginger really comes through here and nothing is too overwhelming. Nice crispy bread. Would 100% buy several to eat throughout the week if I could. 

Pho - Ordered the kid size so I could save room for more food lol but even the kid size was a decent serving! Ideally would have liked more flavor in the broth, but meat is so fresh and moist (not dry like most pho spots). 

Rice with Grilled Pork - Another happy surprise! I want to pack whatever the sauce is in a bottle and pour it on everything. The only thing I would change is the portion size- much less than what I'm used to getting."
5,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,1/25/2022,Wonderful! I would definitely come back. We loved our summer roll and pho - perfect for a cold day. They have a unique dipping sauce for their summer rolls which we absolutely loved. The pho was fantastic with a great broth. Our server was extremely kind and we felt bad that he was so busy! He was attentive nonetheless and our experience was flawless. We also both also got smoothies since we were craving it and they were delicious and definitely made with fresh fruit. I got the avocado smoothie and my husband got the strawberry banana smoothie! Great spot for when you're craving Vietnamese food!

Then we added traditional Pho Bo (noodle soup)

We have been to too many Vietnamese restaurants to remember but we will never forget the EXCELLENT, succulent, Â perfectly balanced Pho Bo....whatever they did, not your pedestrian version!

Waiters took a long time to bring water and paper menus, and our food took about an hour to come. The three of us wanted the signature banh mi, but they were out of jambon so we had to order a banh mi with pate and pulled chicken instead. The filling to bread ratio was also pretty off, but was still tasty nonetheless. I might come here again, but for takeout only."

9,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/7/2022,"This is a great spot for Pho, Spring Rolls, or any other staple Vietnamese dish. I feel this spot doesn't get the credit it deserves due to its close proximity to Pho Basil, and the neighborhood Taylor's mostly to college kids. Kids of this age might not have yet developed the pallet for such tasty and culture enriched foods, or have the money! I feel their dishes are fairly priced! I highly recommend this place if you're in the area! It's been really quiet the last few times I went and I hope they make it!!"
10,Saigon Fusion,2 star rating,10/22/2021,"Arrived at 5:30, the place was empty. The staff did not know we were there a few minutes later. I like how the menu is simple but the service is really slow. We placed our order, we ordered strawberry ade and avocado smoothie, signature banh mi, and 2 kids pho with ribs added. After 30 minutes of waiting, we almost finish our drink. banh mi still has not arrived yet. Finally, two customers came and our banh mi arrived, which is unacceptable banh mi should me a quick service especially we were the only customers there with no take out orders. The banh mi is tasty but the portion is small for the price but this is what you should expect at Mass Ave. By the time we finished our banh mi, our pho still have not arrived yet. All tables are taken after we are 45 minutes there and finally our pho arrives. With the kid's size, the portion is perfect for us since we finish our drink and share the banh mi. The beef is so tender since they use steaks instead of beef briskets or fatty beef that most Vietnamese restaurants used for their pho. We added ribs which were soft, delicious and this is the main reason want to try their pho. For the total, it was nearly $56. The boss who did not give us was holding on to our card after giving us the receipt to sign. I don't know if she forgot our card is in her hand or not because the card is wrapped with the customer receipt. By the time we leave the place, only one table had food on the table... Don't expect this place to serve food fast even with limited items on the menu like other Vietnamese restaurants with large selections on the menu or those banh mi shops for quick bites."
11,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,4/24/2021,"TAKE OUT REVIEW - order ahead !

If you're in the mood for Vietnamese come here. If you're in the mood for delicious thin meat slices either in soup or bread come here. Just come. 

Please come here on a weekday for a swift meal. Weekend especially Saturday night will *not* be the best time. It is a small restaurant and everyone already knows how delicious it is, so your order will be delayed and you won't get a table. Socially distanced seating means there are only like 5 tables inside and one table outside. If you must then make a reservation and bring your patience. 

Take out pho ($13.95) comes with separately packaged soup, bean sprout / greens, noodles in a bowl, and meat wrapped in paper. Very thoughtful. Different cuts of meat come in the pho and the raw thinly sliced meat comes separately packaged. Once you pour the soup in the bowl, the meat will cook in that beef broth and it will compliment your noodles with that tender bite. 

Take out signature banh mi ($8.00) comes with pate, jambon, and shredded chicken. There isn't much of the typical pickled carrots and daikon but so much more of meat than usual. And they're seasoned incredibly. This is one of the best (if not the best) banh mi I've had. The baguette is also quite nice. I want to eat this banh mi again tomorrow. I really love this sandwich. Plus that price - 100% recommend. 

Let's support precious local businesses."
12,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,10/10/2021,"Best pho and banh mi place I've found so far in Boston. Their menu is small but good. I've been here twice, once for banh mi and another for pho. Their food is a little different (for instance, the banh mi didn't include like, picked carrots or cucumber) but presented very well and really fresh. As for the pho, the broth was very flavorful and the small size was filling for me. I also tried some of a friend's rice dish and it was really good, too, so I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you decide to order.

A tip, though: seating is limited and it get can very busy, so I'd call ahead if you have a group (I had a group of just 4 and still had to wait 20 or so minutes for seating). Also, if it's later in the day, it might be a good idea to call and ask if they still have pho broth. I went in one evening just to find out they didn't have pho available.

EDIT: ANOTHER TIP: CALL BEFORE YOU GO. I've gone 5 times over the past few months, on different days, and they were closed 3/5 times (1 was due to an unforeseen issue so not their fault, but the other two times, they were closed on days that google, yelp, etc. said they would be open, only to see that they were closed with no notice why. I don't know if they've changed their hours or something, but it's made it frustrating to eat here."
13,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,11/5/2021,"I enjoyed the fresh spring rolls with grilled pork, served with wonderful dipping sauce. I ate a bowl of beef Â noodle soup with fabulous broth."
14,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,1/23/2021,Was randomly craving a banh mi and this was the only place open at the time. So happy I stumbled upon here because their banh mi was delicious! I got the cold cut. I also got their Vietnamese iced coffee which was also very well made! They did fill the cup up with a lot of ice though. I will definitely come here again!
15,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,4/20/2021,"This is possibly one of my new favorite restaurants in Boston and some of the best pho & spring rolls I've had. Next time you don't know what to eat for lunch/dinner go here!

The pho tasted so clean and flavorful. The quality of meat was unexpectedly good -- it was super tender and noticeably better than what your average pho has. 11/10.
The spring rolls were crisp, fresh, and was really good with the sauce. 10/10!

I definitely will be coming more regularly and hope to try the banh mi and the rice plate soon :)"
16,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,7/29/2021,"Easy 5 stars. 

ORDER AHEAD, they take their time cooking it up. 30 min pickup and like a 5 min wait when I got there. If you're impatient like that and order from here, don't leave a 1 star review because you had to wait an extra 10 minutes for your food. It's delicious and worth the wait 

Great spot to swing by after work. Got grilled chicken rice plate and chicken Bahn mi. Chicken rice plate is really good- fresh veggies and ingredients, everything is delicious, chicken is tender, flavor is on point. Grilled chicken bahn mi was also delicious. Well balanced flavors with fresh veggies 

Also, seems to be family run. That's always a plus for me"
17,Saigon Fusion,2 star rating,11/22/2021,"Food was good, nothing extraordinary. Portions were a bit small for the price ($15.50 for a bowl of phone and an extra $5.50 if you want to add a single rib). Service was absolutely horrible. When my boyfriend and I got there at 6:30pm on a Monday night, the one single waitress working there told us there were no tables available, practically shooing us out the door. I then asked if there was a waitlist to which she then said yes there's about a 30 minute wait and one party ahead of you. We didn't mind waiting the 30 minutes, so we waited and eventually were seated at 7pm, we placed our order around 7:10pm but didn't receive water or our apps (1 order of shrimp spring rolls and 1 order of grilled pork banh mi) until7:30pm and 7:45pm respectively. We waited until 8:20pm for 2 orders of the kid size pho ($11) and then approached the waitress to get our check and our order of pho to go. There were multiple times during our dinning experience that the waitress turned down customers well before (35 minutes) closing and dining customers asked about their orders/ requested their orders for take out instead of dine in. I understand there is a lack of restaurant staff shortage but communication is key and our waitress did not communicate with us. Overall, would not come back until more wait and kitchen staff have been hired. 

Also, you can walk 2 minutes down the street to Pho Basil and get a tasty large bowl of pho for $12 and good service (even on a busy Saturday night)."
18,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,11/7/2020,"Spectacular customer service. A+

Social distancing is here and enforced. Indoor and outdoor dining. A+

The banh mi's are the best. Had the generally accepted ones in Dorchester. These sandwiches surpassed it easily. The pate is made in house. The baguette is not but it is on point. The choice of proteins are excellent as well. Â A+

The pho is A1! Broth is simmered for 20 hours. Definitely the best bowl of soup, rice noodles, and protein in massachusetts. The bowl is 13.95 but it's worth it - it's considered self care. Outstanding bowl . A+

Salted limeade is house made. Great for a sore throat too A+++++
Tangerine soda house made. Better than your favorite soda. A+++"
19,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/20/2022,"Phenomenal - natural food cooked from scratch, service, ambiance and decoration (esp. the florals / plants). Â The whole family enjoyed our experience. Highly recommended!"
20,Saigon Fusion,2 star rating,11/7/2021,"Let time I went, Bahn mi pork was burnt, I wanted to give them another chance, I called in an order for pickup, was told it would be 15-20 min. I showed up 15 minutes later and they told me 45 minutes after they charged me. They refunded me, but still annoying."
21,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,12/26/2021,"The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because it always seems to be understaffed or closed at random times. I think that it is run by two people and they close due to maintenance or personal reasons but there is no way to know this unless you physically go to the restaurant and then realize that you have to go somewhere else instead. The food here is amazing, especially the pho. I honestly think this is the best pho I have had in Boston. I would recommend it for their pho to anyone but like I said, I would call ahead of time to make sure they are open."
22,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,10/23/2020,"If you love Pho (Beef noodle soup) and I am talking about the quality authentic one, you must try this place! Nowadays most restaurants make it lucrative by not spending enough time to slow cook the broth from real ingredients but use lots of seasonings to make it taste good... I'm so glad I finally found this rare gem where I can enjoy the real quality authentic Pho. 
Try this place and you will learn how a ""real"" Pho should taste like!"
23,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,11/6/2021,"Pretty good pho, better than most places in Boston. The service was a bit slow because busy and portion size was on the lower end."
24,Saigon Fusion,1 star rating,11/8/2021,This is the first time I give such a low rating. I would say zero service. No servers at all. wait 10 min to get a seat. wait another 10 minute to order. Only 3 types of food available. The female server is not respecting us at all Worst experience. DONT TRYï¼ï¼
25,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,12/15/2021,"We come here literally every weekend. My favorites are the pho, grilled pork banh mi, and toffee coffee. People saying the service is awful obviously don't realize this is a small family-owned business. The kitchen is tiny and we were told they can only fit 2 people in there at once. Sure, the wait time is long, but if you call ahead you can place your order then or get a reservation. Don't trust the reviews that say Pho Basil down the block is equally as good, because it's not, and it's also not even owned by Vietnamese people. The pho at Saigon Fusion is next level and a million times better than Pho Basil, Pho Pasteur, Pho Hoa, Pho Le, and literally every other Vietnamese restaurant combined in Boston. But honestly, other people can stay going to those other places so Saigon Fusion doesn't become blow up and become even busier!"
26,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,5/18/2021,I think the food here is good but not super authentic. The pho broth was pretty bland but I do appreciate the fresh cuts of meat. The banh mi had good pate but they didn't even offer the classic cold cut option. I'd come back but the prices are pretty steep for Vietnamese food.
27,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/12/2021,"The Bahn Mi, simply put, is something you need to try. Filled with grilled Jabon, fresh vegetables, and encased in a wonderfully crisp baguette, this is an incredible sandwich at a reasonable price. If I were to choose between this and a burger, this would win any day of the week. If you're a pate fan, please do yourself a favor and come here--they make it in-house."
28,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,10/5/2021,"They ran out of pho!! I don't know how but we tried ordering 4 bowls of pho, and they only had 3. Anyway, they don't immediately offer chopsticks and you have to ask for them. The food is good, but does take a long time for it to come out. Service is kind of slow."
29,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/16/2021,"We decided to try this place out as it is down the street from pho basil. Parking was a little challenging but we got take out so it wasn't a problem. We ordered grilled pork spring rolls and the sauce that comes with it is not a peanut sauce, more like a sweet duck sauce. We also ordered the pho which was packaged nicely. The noodles and beef were packaged in a ready to eat bowl with the pho broth on the side. The rare steak was so tender and the broth was so flavorful without needing any hoisin/sriracha. I loved that the noodles were cooked al dente. I only wish that they gave us more beansprouts and basil. We also tried the banh mi sandwich with grilled pork. The portion size is a little smaller than a banh mi you'd expect in Dorchester but it was very good!! Overall food is tasty, a bit on the pricier side for viet food, but considering the location it's reasonable."
30,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/8/2022,honestly one of the best pho places in boston. owner is incredibly sweet and takes great pride in using fresh ingredients and making food on the spot. the pho is simply delicious and the broth is very deep and flavorful. customer service is great and could not complain. the bahn mi is also very good and i recommend everything.
31,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,9/1/2021,"Tasty but far too slow. Â We arrived late for lunch on a Wednesday. Only one other table was filled so we figured it would be a quick bite. We ordered right away but it took almost 30 minutes to get our summer roll and another 10 for a banh mi sandwich and pho. Everything was good, but I just can't push the review stars any higher with such a long wait."
32,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/22/2021,"Very nice space, good location and delicious.

Delicious Vietnamese food, family women-owned local business."
33,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"I'm Vietnamese and have eaten V food all over including Vietnam, Orange County, San Jose. This is one of my best V experiences. Amazing pho broth. The right herbs, spices, real bone broth. Fresh spring rolls have the right ratio. Â Even the rice plate was the bomb. Order everything. The banh mi sandwich is a different than typical, less crunchy, more meaty. Smaller, but tender. It's a formula from their five banh mi locations in their Vietnam home town (Canh Tho, I believe). 

Warning, the kitchen is really slow, but you'll taste why."
34,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,6/17/2021,"this small restaurant is quite easy to simply walk by and miss, but it honestly has some of the best viet food that i've ever had!
-they don't have an official website or anything, so there's no direct way to order delivery/pickup. however, you can probably call them to place an order in advance. we came to the restaurant in person to place an order for takeout.
-there's no outdoor seating, and just a couple of tables inside the restaurant. basically all of the tables were occupied by 6 pm on a weekday.
-we paid with card, but i think they accept cash as well.
-while the workers here are friendly and welcoming, our food took a really long time to make. they originally told us that it would only be a 30 minute wait, but we ended up waiting for a whole hour. while it was kind of an inconvenience since we were in a rush to leave, they also had a lot of customers to take care of at the time. 

4/29/21
-grilled pork banh mi 7: this banh mi has grilled minced pork along with some other veggies (cucumber, scallion, leek, cilantro, etc). the style of this banh mi is also quite different from the banh mis in nyc, since it didn't seem to have any pickled carrots/daikon. the baguette was toasted just the right amount, but a bit thinner/flatter in size; i remember it was around 8-9 inches in length? the grilled pork was sooo flavorful and definitely one of the best tasting banh mis that i've ever had. it was only $7, which is cheaper than many places in nyc. (4.5/5)
-signature banh mi: their signature banh mi has a combination of pate, jombon (vietnamese ham), pulled chicken, along with the same veggies as the other banh mi. it was also really good! the meat was cooked just the right amount and tasted great. other than that, it was pretty much the same as the grilled pork banh mi in terms of the size and baguette. this one was more expensive at $8, but was still worth it imo. (4.5/5)
-grilled shrimp spring rolls: each spring roll was pretty long and had three pieces of large shrimp inside, along with thin vermicelli noodles, ban sprouts, mint, and pickled daikon/carrots. the chopped peanuts and peanut sauce on the side was really great as well. i felt like $5.75 was a relatively fair price for these, but there wasn't anything particularly special about them. (3.5/5)
-grilled chicken rice bowl: this bowl had grilled chicken, broken rice, a fried egg, pickled daikon/carrots, cucumber, tomatoes, mixed greens, green onions, and fish sauce. this meal was super balanced and had a fair amount of protein compared to the fresh veggies and rice. it tasted even better with the sauce! it was also very filling for $12.50. (4/5)

overall, i definitely would've given this place 5 stars if our food didn't take so long to make. i can see myself coming back here pretty often in the future, especially since most of their menu options are reasonably priced and filling. 
my favorites that i would recommend you must try would be their grilled pork banh mi and the signature banh mi."
35,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,11/19/2020,"This place seems absolutely heavenly when you walk in, which is how my roommate and I got hooked and we can't envision ever going back to the days when we didn't know about Saigon Fusion.

First off, they have almost 0 online presence and have a Microsoft Word document menu with like 6 items. That's how you know it's LEGIT.

Their spring rolls are authentic - I would go light on the mint because it can be pretty overpowering flavor wise. The banh mi is perfection - be careful because the spice seems tolerable and then you get a bite of pepper and it just whacks you in the throat. The pho is amazing but don't wait too long to pick up your order as the broth can get cold. 

Space is quite small and during COVID, I would recommend picking up if you're worried about distancing (as you should be)."
36,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,11/22/2021,"Decent food but awful service. They are randomly closed for no reason, sometime when you call their chef isn't in and so they can't take orders (???), and pickup can take up to 1 hour. They're also always out of jambon (then why have it on their menu?). I rarely write reviews but their absurd business model convinced me to tell the world how bad it is."
37,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,6/12/2021,"1st time having Pho at Saigon Fusion, and it was phenomenal. Hands down.. best Vietnamese restaurant in Boston! Broth was clean and flavor-able, meat was tender & plentiful, noodles cooked perfectly. The presentation of the bowl was appreciated! Pho Basil is down the road and it is good ... but Saigon Fusion is GREAT! Hard workers too!!! I will be coming back here every time I want Vietnamese food!"
38,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,7/5/2021,"Good fancy pho but service was super slow. I would prefer a cheap no thrills, fast service, great broth pho joint personally. Â Paid close to $50 for two pho and two shrimp spring rolls which was a bit steep. I will say that the quality of the meat was unparalleled to any other pho I've had and I left really full from the meal."
39,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/23/2020,"Such a nice surprise! I don't normally do reviews, but after this amazing meal and speaking with the sweet staff, I feel compelled to share this little gem. 

My friend and I were walking down Mass Ave to get pho from pho basil, and stumbled upon this place on our way. We decided to step in and try it instead. Since we were starving, we decided to both order pho and share the Bahn mi as an appetizer. The Bahn mi is amazing! The bread was warm and fresh, as if it were just pulled from the oven. It had a nice soft crunch to the outside and the ingredients in the sandwich were so fresh and flavorful.

The pho was also phenomenal as well. You can tell that they care a lot about the quality of the ingredients they use. I think this may be my new favorite place! FYI, they're going to be adding more menu items later with pastries and cakes to add to the cafe atmosphere. Looking forward to checking that out! Thank you again for such an amazing meal :)"
40,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,2/25/2020,"Third time (or is it fourth?) time mig. Be a charm for the space long seeking an identity 

Good fresh shrimp spring rolls and under $13 pho is a decent deal.

Not sure I loved the 90s throwback soundtrack Celine Dions ""Let's Talk About Love"", with all its Jim Steinman bombastic-ness. Maybe it was being played ironically :) 

They are so new they don't have menus printed up so you have to peer around at blackboards to see what's to order - its kind of charming, actually."
41,Saigon Fusion,2 star rating,11/29/2021,"I didn't have a good dining experience. We ordered two bowls of pho, a banh mi with cold cuts, and two smoothies. We first received our smoothies. I liked the flavor and appreciated the use of real strawberries/bananas and avocado. However, I think the smoothies could have been blended for an extra minute or so because I found the smoothie was gritty from the small chunks of ice throughout. I'm not sure why but we were never offered any water or tea during our meal or checked up on if we needed anything. It took another 30-35 minutes for the banh mi to come out. The sandwich is pretty good and I would get it again because they used the correct bread, tasty meat, and pate. We waited another 15 minutes for our bowls of pho and I was pretty disappointed by the portion size, considering that each bowl is $15 (which is very high for pho). The full size bowl of pho here is comparable to a kids size at other restaurants. Unfortunately, the taste of the broth does not make up for much. I would not recommend the pho because there are not many cuts of meat and the broth tastes strange. Overall, I don't think I would come again despite enjoying the banh mi sandwich just because the service here is very slow. It's impractical to try to swing by for lunch and get a banh mi for pick up because it takes like 30-40 minutes. In addition, there are not many options on the menu. Despite having a lean menu, the restaurant also didn't have any of the rice plates in stock, so our food options were even more limited."
42,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,11/28/2020,"Phenomenal ! They only have 4 dishes which is rice , banh mi , pho and spring roll. And just pork and chicken for choices ; sadly. Â We of course ordered all of it. The pho is flavorful . The rice is cooked prefect the banh mi was crunchy and the spring roll they used banh hoi which is a very refreshing way to make it because they are the only one that use banh hoi. But they portion is smaller then most restaurants."
43,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/18/2020,"Just walked into this place thinking it had always been here. Menu is simple but with varied options if you are craving pho or a banh mi. 
I had the pho. It had a really nice portion of meat, savory taste, and the side herbs were great! Not only did I get the regular sprouts, basil, and lime BUT there was sawgrass and one more (don't know the name) that added an extra something delicious you won't get at other pho places.
The owner came to say Hi and ask how I enjoyed my food. She was sweet and friendly. A very nice touch!
I will definitely be coming back and bringing a friend"
44,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,10/4/2021,This place attracted me because of the smell when I walked by and the flavor did not disappoint. I tried the pork fried rice and spring rolls which were both fantastic. A few missing items on the menu but I'll be back to try those!
45,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/18/2021,"This place is the real deal. Didn't think much of it given how many restaurants are around mainly catering to students in the area, but this is some of the best Vietnamese food I've had in Boston. Small menu but they do everything right. Banh mi is great, pho is delicious. Since it's a small operation I've sometimes had to wait a bit longer for takeout but it's worth it in the end."
46,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,10/11/2020,"I went on a whim as I was walking by because everyone at their outdoor seating had such delicious looking food and it had been a while since I went out for Vietnamese food. 
Everything was delicious. The Pho soup was incredible, my boyfriend ordered it but I insisted we share after tasting it & the baguette sandwich we ordered was delicious. Perfectly spicy but not too much. I forgot to mention we started with their spring rolls which were so fresh! Our waitress suggested their tangerine soda, made in-house and it was so tasty! Like a health Fanta, but better.

We overheard a conversation between the cashier and another patron saying they opened in February and today was the first day they were able to open post quarantine. Wow I must say, they had everything running smoothly and with such delicious food! I recommend their food to everyone! Such a wonderful, quality business and delicious restaurant to support."

Being Vietnamese myself, I have unreasonably high standards for Vietnamese restaurants and this place meets it. Every. Single. Time. The spring rolls are very authentic with different herbs and homemade fish sauce. The phá» broth is so clean and delicious. The bÃ¡nh mÃ¬ is out of this world. The owner told us how she makes everything to order to ensure freshness and quality, that's why things can take a little longer to come out, but oh so worth it! We already plan to come back for more this weekend."
49,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/7/2021,The best Bahn Mi sandwich!!! Great place and fair prices. Absolutely my favorite in Boston area
50,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,2/22/2020,"It feels weird calling this place a hidden gem when it's actually in a prime location right on Massachusetts Ave, a block away from Symphony Hall. But the restaurant seems to have struggled a bit to find its footing, based on its Yelp page: one early review complains about inconsistent menu offerings; the name and description (inaccurately) refers to the cuisine as a fusion of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Thai flavors; and even the menu photos seem out of date, picturing ramen bowls and other Japanese-influenced appetizers alongside unique banh mi combos. While the promise of fusion food intrigued me, the mixed messages put off my Vietnamese girlfriend, and we nearly passed over eating here for Saturday brunch.

We took our chances though, and left impressed and impressively full. In an ironic twist, this latest (and hopefully last) iteration of Saigon Fusion's menu features no-nonsense Vietnamese specialties--if you're looking for fusion, you're better off going to Pho Basil a block away. 

We started off by splitting a pate and jambon (ham) banh mi ($7.50) between us as an appetizer, and followed it up with a bowl of pho ($12.50) each. The pho was good and came with high quality cuts of beef, but we both agreed it was the banh mi that stole the show--the baguette was perfectly crusty on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside, and filled with enough well-mixed pate and aioli to make every bite a delight. The surprising lack of pickled carrots and radish didn't even register as a disappointment, since the mix of fresh veggies that were included more than made up for it. 

The price point is a bit high for Vietnamese food, but reasonable for the area, and again the food is of genuinely high quality. My girlfriend adored the aesthetics of the place too: cute little pots of live flowers served as a centerpiece on each table, the chalk-drawn menus struck a fine balance between artsy and informative, and the music (a lot of classic French love songs) elevated our casual dining experience to just this side of classy. Really loved what they're doing here, and will definitely come again."
51,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/8/2020,"I love the pho noodles here! The broth had been simmered for many hours and has a rich complex flavor. The beef is fresh, tender, and flavorful. 

Beautiful interior. Friendly and attentive staff.

The place seemed to have change owners recently but kept the same name. Now it only serves quality authentic Vietnamese food. No fusion nonsense. The new menu serves pho noodles, grilled pork rice plate, Vietnamese sandwiches, and some appetizers. 

This is a hidden gem. A notch better than the overcrowded Pho Basil nearby in my opinion."
52,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,12/1/2020,HIDDEN GEM for Vietnamese food!! I love this family owned restaurant. Take it from someone who has high standards for her Viet food- this place gives my mom's food a run for her money. Very authentic pho. You can tell everything is made with care from the dine-in presentation to pick up packaging. A+ COVID precautions. Looking for a tasty small business restaurant to support? Look no further.
53,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,6/4/2021,I've been looking for a good Bahn Mi shop ever since my favorite store in Chinatown closed down due to COVID. Saigon Fusion hit the spot with some solid Bahn Mi sandwiches. Will definitely be back again!
54,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,5/9/2021,"I want to give a better review, I really do. But waiting more than an hour for takeout pickup is not okay. It's not crowded. We ordered before noon so before the lunchtime rush. No good explanation given."
55,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,4/26/2021,thought the pho broth was comparable to some in the bay area (which is a good thing) - definitely the best broth ive had in boston

57,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,11/28/2020,"Hands down the best Vietnamese food in the Boston area! All dishes are extremely fresh and vivid. Because they don't do delivery yet and I don't live nearby, every time I visit I try taking out as much as food as I could, usually a few Banh Mis which I toast in my oven and they taste as good as if I had them dining in!"
58,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/1/2021,"As someone who is Vietnamese, I'm thrilled to say their food is amazing and authentic, and the business is run by fantastic owners. They were very busy last weekend so the wait time was a bit longer, and the owner made us some free thai tea to thank us for our patience. Great service and quality bÃ¡nh mÃ¬ for reasonable prices, I highly recommend!"
59,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/24/2020,Saigon Fusion is under new ownership so our family stopped to grab a bite to eat. I highly recommend the pho (which was packed with flavor) and the Banh Mi that was fresh. This is some of the most authentic Vietnamese food you can get in this area. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great! The quality and amount of food you get is fair to the prices. I'll be back many more times! It was such a positive experience eating here.
60,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/15/2020,"Food and service were both excellent. Â Pho was fantastic -- broth was hearty without being overly salty/greasy, quality of beef was great (not stringy or chewy like other places). I also liked the accompaniments for the soup -- not the standard Thai basil but some unique herbs and veggies that elevated the pho. Â 

Also tried one of the Banh mi sandwiches, something that is lacking in this area. Â Bread was warm, and just the right texture (not too crumbly and for once, my jaw and upper mouth did not hurt afterward). Happy to not have to trek all the way to Allston or Chinatown from now on. 

Really happy to have this authentic Vietnamese place nearby and will definitely come again. Â Service was warm, attentive and prompt. Â Decor is warm and bright, and much cleaner than a lot of the other restaurants on the block. 

PS: Â Strawberry milk and orange soda drinks were also great!"
61,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,1/31/2021,Amazing food! Amazing owners!! They're so friendly and the food is spectacular. My friend I went with loved the banh mi so much she bought a second one to eat later!!! Definitely support this business!!
62,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/17/2020,"Don't miss this charming little Vietnamese cafe when in the Symphony neighborhood. Simply delicious pho, really the best I have ever had! Â The flavor notes in the broth are simple yet complex and the accouterments are super fresh and fragrant. I can't wait to go back. I bet there'll be a line out the door!"
63,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,10/10/2020,"Woohoo!! Â They are OPEN again after closing in March. While they were closed, we got take out from so many different Vietnamese places all around Boston and we couldn't find Vietnamese food better than this. Â This is a family-run business and everything they make tastes super fresh. Their soup is fragrant with herbs, their meat is high quality, and the bread for the sandwiches is homemade. Truly a gem in this neighborhood and not to be missed!"
64,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/17/2020,"Boy I needed a bowl of pho and here it is. Delicious. The greens were so fresh and tart. Lovely, homey place to relax. Forgot to add, they serve a fantastic cup of green tea"
65,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,12/29/2020,My cousins and I dined here during a trip to Boston. We are three Vietnamese born and raised in Vietnam. I all agreed this is the best pho we had ever since we move to the States. If you look for good pho this is the place!
66,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,12/24/2020,Best fresh Spring Rolls I've had. Â I also like the grilled rice plate. Â They are friendly and I wish them the best! Â They gave me a cookie and a free iced coffee on Christmas Even when I got take out.
67,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/8/2020,Best pho in Boston proper. I have visited every weekend and the taste is always consistent!
68,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/4/2020,Best Ph around. Perfect place to hang out with friends. Don't forget to try bÃ¡nh mÃ¬ and rice plate too.
69,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/28/2020,"This is a very new restaurant, but they're getting off to a strong start! Some of the best and freshest spring rolls and egg rolls I've ever had. The bÃ¡hn mi had fantastic well toasted bread and delicious ingredients. Beef pho was also amazing! Staff was extremely friendly and welcoming to a larger party. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Boston."
0,GRECO,5 star rating,2/27/2022,"This place is popular for a reason! We get delivery from here often because their food travels well and tastes almost equivalent to how it would if you physically ate it in the establishment. My boyfriend and I love getting the mixed grill. It is amazing because it gives you the opportunity to try many of their different meats - loukaniko (sausage), bifteki (ground beef), lamb chop, chicken and pork gyro. It also comes with the spicy feta, tzatziki, fries, tomatoes, onions, and pita bread. Not only does it taste amazing but it is such a great value!! 

Also highly recommend their zucchini chips - they are sliced super thin and fried to perfection! We also love the yaya's loukoumades (Greek donuts) that are drenched in Nutella, Oreo bits, and powdered sugar!"
1,GRECO,4 star rating,2/2/2022,"This was my first visit to a Greco location, and it was an enjoyable workweek lunch experience! I ordered the pork plate w zucchini chips (also pictured is my partner's order: a lamb plate w french fries) --

TASTE: 3.5/5 - the pork could've used a little more flavor, but the lamb was chef's kiss
TEXTURE: 4/5 - the contrast between the tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki was really nice, and the zucchini chips were fire!
PRICE: 4/5 - mostly because I was happy to use my $25 gift card. Note: currently, gift cards can only be redeemed in-store, and not on the Greco app!
SERVING SIZE: 5/5 - pleasantly larger portions than I expected, so twas a lot of food for me!
SERVICE: 4/5 - not many folks there around noon on a Wednesday, and we got our takeout shortly after ordering
ATMOSPHERE: 3.5/5 - located below ground level, and the inside is cute and minimal
TAKEOUT: 4/5 - containers are compostable, a plus!
PARKING: 4/5 - got lucky w a metered spot a block away on Newbury"
2,GRECO,4 star rating,1/7/2022,"Came here with my friend on New Year's Eve just before noon. We were able to beat the rush of people who came in following us. There were a couple of small spaces to sit down and eat as well as outside, but given that it was cold and raining, those seats weren't available. 

The workers were super friendly and quick as preparing the food. My friend ordered the lamb bowl with zucchini chips and tzatziki while I had the pork gyro with spicy feta. Trying a bit of both of our foods, I did prefer the pork over the lamb. Although equally as flavorful, I found the pork more tender and moist. The gyro was a fun and convenient way to eat since it was so compact and efficient at having a bit of pork, fries, tomato and feta in every bite. The pita was soft and I really enjoyed the zucchini chips which were crisp, perfect for the light tzatziki sauce. 

For dessert, we shared the loukoumades with custard, pistachios, honey and shaved filo. The toppings were good but other I could tell the loukoumades weren't fries and given time to soak up the honey like other homemade versions I've had before. In addition, I'm not sure if it was the filo or pistachios that were almost rock like when eating. 

Would come again to try more items from their menu."
3,GRECO,4 star rating,4/5/2022,"I stopped by around noon and shouldv'e definitely ordered online for pick up to avoid lunch traffic. I ordered the veggie plate with fries and the classic loukoumades (greek style doughnuts). The wait wasn't too bad, considering it was peak lunch hour. The veggie plate was super filling. I'm not sure I would order the classic loukoumades again because they were doused in so much honey, so it was too sweet for my liking. I would come back to try the other two toppings though."
4,GRECO,4 star rating,4/3/2022,"Solid meal; I would say it's more like a 3.5. I ordered the classic lamb pita with Greco fries. I think the classic lamb pita was a bit too oily for my liking and could have been better if it had lettuce or tomatoes or another fresh ingredient--I think it only came with meat, onions, and sauce. Although I appreciate how much meat there was, I think a balance of veggies and meat would have been better. The meat was actually pretty tender and well seasoned; sometimes I am skeptical of lamb since it can be tough if not cooked properly. I did like the tzatziki sauce it came with, it tasted homemade and creamy. The Greco fries were nothing special. I was expecting a little more seasoning or toppings besides the cheese and maybe oregano."
5,GRECO,3 star rating,3/30/2022,"I had the veggie wrap of zucchini fritters, fries and sauces and got some zucchini chips on the side. The wrap became difficult to eat at the end because of the sauce that was not well distributed. The chips were not evenly seasoned, leaving some to be fantastic, and others to be bland."
6,GRECO,4 star rating,12/2/2021,"Greco is a great option for quick counter-service food on Newbury Street that's not too overpriced (at least by Newbury standards!).

The menu here is comprised of gyros, salads, BYO plates, innovative sides, and even some Greek doughnuts (was too full to try on my first visit, but sounded really tasty!).

I tried the loukaniko (pork/leek sausage) wrap, and it was definitely a winner. The sausage was flavorful and juicy, and the fries/potatoes on the wrap were perfectly fresh. My only tiny gripe was that the sausage was super salty, but about halfway through I got used to it - and overall it was still a great wrap.

I tried a few of my friend's zucchini chips, and would definitely recommend those as well - light, very thinly sliced, and one of those rare fried snacks that doesn't actually feel greasy at all.

The food comes up quick, and the indoor space, although small, wasn't overly crowded on a weekday night around dinner time (maybe we just got lucky?)

It also seems they do a lot of takeout orders - honestly, if I lived closer, I'd be hitting this place up all the time for takeout."
7,GRECO,4 star rating,11/1/2021,"For a quick work lunch this Monday noon I walked over to Greco. Walking past the outdoor seating on street level and descending a half flight of stairs, I reached the interior, which possessed the light wood, large windows, and exposed concrete necessary for new, trendy restaurants (aka ""industrial chic""). 

My order consisted of the following
- Loukaniko Pita | $10.50
- Zucchini Chips | $4.5

Originally, I planned on ordering the lamb gyro. However, the Loukaniko Pita, with pork and leek sausage, caught my eye. The sausage had the same texture and grill char as other gyro (like beef), but with a much sweeter savoriness. (imagine the difference between normal ground pork and a ground pork and leek or cabbage dumpling). That, cut by mustard, proved satisfying. I initially thought the portion size too small, but I underestimated the staying power of pita bread and ""hand cut potatoes"" (read: fries) inside the pita. 

The zucchini fries tasted like crack - of the salt and oil variety. I appreciated the rendering of a vegetable into something unhealthy.

On a side note, gyro with fries seemed quite Californian. I did not expect to find it here."
8,GRECO,4 star rating,9/19/2021,"We wanted to try a new dessert and this came up in the recommendations. We ordered the Loukoumades(Greek donuts). This was a Saturday night(~7:30) and the place was packed, line almost out the door. Took about 20 mins to order and receive our donuts. 

Classic(Greek honey, walnuts and cinnamon) - the honey tasted off to me. 
Papous(matisha creme and pistachios) - this was really good, would come back for this and try their other two flavors."
9,GRECO,5 star rating,8/29/2021,"I'm very impressed by the food and the extremely fast service. The prices are not bad at all for a fast-casual spot on Newbury!

Came here on a hot weekday evening. The indoor seating was completely full and the cooks were busy preparing takeout orders. I got a bifteki pita wrap ($10.50) and bougatsa loukoumades ($7). My order was done in about 10 minutes. I noticed that others who only ordered pita wraps got their orders within a minute of paying-- the donuts probably take more time.

There are small tables outside to sit at and I highly recommend grabbing a small stack of napkins from the store if you plan to eat outside. The pita wrap was stuffed with meat and fries and was a bit messy to eat.

The bifteki was hearty and very flavorful. I loved the spicy feta it came with (and they gave a lot of it). The fries were crispy and nicely seasoned, too.

Even if I happened to eat dinner somewhere else, I'd come here just for their loukoumades. The donuts are soft and chewy (almost reminded me of mochi donuts). The bougatsa (custard creme, phyllo, cinnamon) was not too sweet. I could honestly eat the entire box by myself. I'll have to try their other flavors sometime soon."
10,GRECO,5 star rating,8/24/2021,"I've seen Greco's loukoumades all over TikTok and knew I had to give them a try!

I ordered the classic pork gyro and the kataifi loukoumades. The pork gyro was very flavorful and delicious! I really liked that the French fries were included inside the gyro! The loukoumades were also delicious! I really liked the pistachio chunks with the donut pieces! 

Overall, I really enjoyed everything I ate and would definitely come back. I think I'm going to try to lamb gyro with Yaya's loukoumades next!"
11,GRECO,5 star rating,8/14/2021,"Gyro, but make it a salad. Traditional gyros, salads, spanakopita-inspired flaky spring rolls, and so much more. This place is filled with so many tasty options Â it was honestly hard to choose, BUT gyros are always a good choice & the fresh veggies + tzatziki made this a must! 

Loved the lamb and other meats roasting on the spits behind the counter. Location itself is fast-casual with some indoor seating, outdoor patio, and to-go options. Friendly staff, fast service, delicious food!"
12,GRECO,5 star rating,8/12/2021,"Came in right as they opened and was greeted warmly by the employees. I enjoyed the Classic Chicken Gyro with flavorful chicken meat and freshly fried french fries. I also had to treat myself to the Yaya's, which was like a mini donut, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was covered in praline and sprinkled with oreo crumbs. It was very sweet and absolutely delectable.

I waited less than 10 minutes for my order and was then on my way. Definitely a great place to grab a bite!"
13,GRECO,4 star rating,5/17/2021,"The yayas loukamades were the star of the show. I wouldn't say it's the ""best dessert I ever had"" but it definitely satisfies one dimension of cravings and was without a doubt really really delicious. It tastes like an elevated version of the funnel cakes we used to get at the carnival when we were younger, golden and crisp on the outside and super soft, doughnuty and airy, fluffy, and soaked with a delightful sweet syrup on the inside that brings so much joy.

The gyro itself was really good, but not the best in the world I would say. My friend got the lamb and it was a little dry; I got the bifteki and would definitely recommend that over the lamb as the beef was more soft and juicy. My favorite part of the gyro was definitely the fries though as they were so crisp and added the perfect unique texture to the gyro. The tzatziki and spicy feta was really refreshing in contrast to the somewhat dry doughy-ness of the pita bread! 

Would come back for the loukamades :)"
14,GRECO,3 star rating,10/24/2021,I thought it was just okay tbh. I had the lamb gyro plate with fries and thought the lamb was dry and fairly flavorless. Others in the party had the chicken gyro and the pork which I thought both were better. Maybe I had a bad batch? Nice seating area outside right on Newberry anyway.
15,GRECO,5 star rating,8/3/2021,"Where has this place been all my life?? Ever since I went to Greece 5 years ago, I've been searching for an authentic Greek gyro like the ones I had every day in little roadside shacks, and I'm thrilled to discover it here on Newbury Street of all places. I got the classic pork gyro and savored every bite. Every component worked in perfect harmony, but the pork was especially good--all tender, crispy, and fatty. If I had to nitpick, I'd say I wish there were more fries, but overall I was very happy. This is what Saloniki in Fenway wishes they could be. It was a lot of food for one person and very reasonably priced for a fast, casual dinner. 

They also have a nice and decently sized patio right on Newbury Street for great people-watching on a nice day. The service was shockingly fast on a weekday night. By the time I paid for my order, I barely had time to glance at my phone, before they were calling it out. The guy at the register was also very pleasant and made ordering really easy. I would love to come back and try the loukoumades which I also haven't had since my Greece trip. On a street full of bustling restaurants, this place is super underrated!"
16,GRECO,5 star rating,9/24/2021,"If you want good greek food prepared quick - this is it! Gyro's, salads, delicious sides and the most amazing greek donuts. Lots of options to choose from. Service always quick and friendly. Indoor and Outdoor seating available."
17,GRECO,4 star rating,9/4/2021,This place is GOOOOD! If you're in the mood for a quick bite without the commitment of dining in at a place- this is for you! I would order any of the classic pitas. The loukoumas (greek style donuts) remind me of beignets- i say if you are planning to get these they can definitely be shared!
18,GRECO,5 star rating,7/5/2021,"This place is perfect I love it

It's quick, simple, delicious, affordable, and fun! 

I came here tonight for a quick and tasty dinner and that's exactly what I got! I ordered the Gyro and the spinach and feta appetizer. Both came our insanely quick and insanely delicious!! Also I must say, the people who worked there are a vibe Â i love them 

The outdoor seating is so cute. I'm definitely coming back!"
19,GRECO,5 star rating,6/12/2021,"This place is amazing because of how incredible the food and service are - the latter (delivered by Jordan) is authentic & superb and truly in a league of its own. If that's something you care about, you'll emerge from this restaurant feeling great!

Jordan is the most caring and dedicated retail professional I've ever met at any establishment anywhere. I have never met anyone in my life who's bent over backwards for a complete stranger the way he did. Jordan was passionate about explaining the menu and importantly, meticulously identifying foods that I wouldn't develop a severe allergic reaction to (for which I have many) and he cared about this even more than I did! When I was only able to eat 25% of ingredients in the dish I ordered, he to my complete surprise offered a free side after I had already sat down because he felt bad I couldn't enjoy many of the foods. If this isn't redefining the very best of expectations, I don't know what is.

The amount of care and dedication Jordan showed is enough to keep me coming back even if the food at GreCo was the most disgusting in the world - that's just how pleasant and kind Jordan is, but the food here is incredible, varied, and differentiated! I will most definitely be coming back over and over again and hope you give it a try too."
20,GRECO,5 star rating,3/4/2022,"DELICIOUS, super cute inside. Efficient service, clean environment, cute seating. The perfect portion and not too expensive. Family owned as well. My new favorite place to eat in Newbury street."
21,GRECO,2 star rating,1/26/2022,"This was the only Greco location i've been too. The staff was great, but the food was not edible :/ I got the egg-lemon soup and the greco fries and my friend got the vegan pita wrap. We also had the iced cappuccino and frappe. Out of all of that, the only thing that we finished were the fries. Everything else we only took a couple bites/sips of and unfortunately it went to waste. I had been wanting to check out Greco for a while after following the IG page . The food simply did not taste good at all (except for the fries!) and the drinks tasted like straight black instant coffee."
22,GRECO,5 star rating,7/12/2021,"Quick, good, perfectly priced. This place hits all the right spots, and I 100% recommend coming here and getting a bite. The flavors were explosive with every bite. Portions were perfect, fills you up and keeps you satisfied. This place checks off every box for me, and I can't rave about them enough. Go try it out!"
23,GRECO,4 star rating,10/19/2021,Stopped here for lunch while on vacation in Boston. It's a cute little counter service spot serving Greek street food on Newbury Street - a great location if doing some shopping or sightseeing in the Back Bay. During prime lunch hours it was quite busy but we managed to snag a table outside. They also have a counter style seating and small tables indoors too. I got a build your own pita with chicken gyro and a side of Greco fries. The service here was excellent and very friendly. The food was delicious and satisfying. I could not get enough of the fries topped with feta. I asked for a side of tzatziki to dip them in and it was delightful. The chicken was kind of salty though and left me feeling bloated for most of the day. I liked having this option of delicious Greek food because most of the trip was very seafood/Italian based food. Definitely a good spot with fair prices to check out for a quick bite.
24,GRECO,5 star rating,3/18/2022,"The lamb chops were a special and they were crazy flavorful!! The zucchini chips were salty and flavorful, pita was soft and warm. Best meal I had in Boston in the 3 days I've been here. Would love to come again!"
25,GRECO,5 star rating,3/11/2021,"TLDR: bomb Greek food 

Came here for a late lunch and this place hit it out of the park. Prices are fair for a casual back bay location and the flavor is excellent. Big fan of the zucchini chips. I got the lamb plate which was filling and my wife got one of their geek salads which had an excellent tender piece of feta. And the latte was not overly sweet and packed with flavor. Would recommend."
26,GRECO,3 star rating,7/7/2021,"I am sad to give only 3 stars but the food was missing something. I had the lamb with greek grains. My husband greek dinner plate with pork, with spanakopita egg rolls which were the best part. Our meal did come with a wonderful show by the owner, Zoe. Zoe is awesome. I look forward to trying it again sometime."
27,GRECO,5 star rating,12/7/2020,Absolutely amazing! I ordered the lamb gyro with a side of tzatziki and everything was super flavourful and fresh. I love that it feels like an indulgent eat but it is balanced and doesn't leave you feeling groggy. The newbury street patio is very pleasant.
28,GRECO,5 star rating,9/6/2021,"Greco is a fast paced experience with quick ordering times and a short wait. There's seating inside and outside but the inside seating is a little bit cramped. The Classic Bifteki had a great char and the spicy feta added a nice tang. The fries also had a very smoky and savory taste. The veggie gyro had generous pieces of zucchini fritters. My friend Alison said that ""they have the opposite problem of other places, they've got too much filling and too little bread."" The pork was a little tougher than my friend expected it to be but it was still bearable and delicious. Our gyros were all stuffed very full and they were very filling. Get the loukamades, I think all the flavors were good, we especially enjoyed the crushed nuts."
29,GRECO,3 star rating,11/30/2020,"What is it with Boston and mediocre mediterranean? Literally every other place serves up the same compostable-bowl nonsense wrapped in a pita-shaped oil sponge. Â Like, does Boston get a discount on sad chickpeas?

This is kind of unfair, GreCo is a nice spot with a nice little outdoor seating area (important for these insane times). Â But the food is just eh. Â It's Spyce, Dig Inn, Cava all over again. Â I give them credit for not shoving everything into a bowl, but the taste is almost exactly the same.

There's a couple highlights: I thought their spicy feta dip was good, but it was also just a cup full of feta. Â Not that I'm complaining. Â I also liked their zucchini chips, but, you can't really go wrong with fried."
30,GRECO,4 star rating,7/3/2020,"I've heard a lot about this place so I knew I had to try it.

The food was pretty good, but I'm not sure if it lives up to the hype. I had the lamb gyro and it was about $11 after tax. Pretty expensive for a gyro, but it's Boston.

The gyro itself had a decent amount of lamb meat and the pita was nice and warm. I do wish it had more flavor though. The lamb could have been seasoned better. Also, the lamb had a lot of chewy fat pieces that I had to awkwardly, discreetly spit out while eating. If these two changes were made, I'd give a higher rating for sure. Still, a solid fresh and satisfying lunch."
31,GRECO,5 star rating,11/10/2020,"As I sat at a table outside on the windy evening and waited for my girlfriend, I decided to sneak a fry from the gyro. ""Damn that was good..."" I thought to myself. ""Please come faster so we can eat this!!""

If you want the best tastebud experience here, go for the gyros. All the ingredients are perfectly balanced and so yummy! The bifteki (beef) is great. For a guy like myself, they don't fill you all the way, so go for the salads or plates for a bigger portion.

At the moment, dining seems to be all outside but there are plenty of tables where you can usually find space for. Food comes pretty fast and there's also a water dispenser inside.

One of my favorite Boston spots!"
32,GRECO,5 star rating,7/13/2021,"Fast casual done RIGHT! Gyros were excellent and came out quick. The staff were funny and engaging and the outdoor, casual setting is great for an easy, inexpensive meal. 

Lamb was fantastic as were the spanakopita (am I spelling that right?). 

I am not sure if this place is looking to expand its beverage option, but I would love to see this place at least serve some Greek wine as IMO a glass of assyrtiko or athiri would have went great with the evening. But, for now, the sparkling water and non-alcoholic options are just fine."
33,GRECO,4 star rating,4/29/2021,"I tried this place for the first time yesterday and it was amazing! It's everything I thought it would be, the classic pork was so flavorful and tasty. As for the desserts, I had to try every one of them and they all were delicious. The only thing I would say is I wish there were more fries in the pita if I remember correctly there was so little fries and maybe more sauce but overall this place is worth it for sure!!"
34,GRECO,5 star rating,10/11/2020,"Service is very fast here! The servers are also friendly and willing to explain the menu (won't make fun of you for not being able to say the names of the dishes). They do social distance customers and have plenty of area to wait for your food. You can eat outside or take out your food. 

Classic Bifteki: The meat inside this was so flavorful and juicy, I was jealous I didn't order this meat myself. The feta cheese mix was great and not too spicy. 

Build your own: I chose the pita with pork and tzatziki sauce. The meat was a little dry but very flavorful. I loved the sauce and if you like cucumbers you should try this sauce. It was so refreshing and went well with all the other flavors. Just in case you aren't aware if you add onions they will be raw, same with the tomato. 

Greco Fries: MY FAVORITE FRIES! These were so flavorful and the feta on top made them great. The fries themselves were crispy and had seasoning but weren't too salty. The feta added to the top made it feel less greasy than just eating french fries. 100% will be ordering again! 

Yaya's: My favorite donuts! They are made fresh so eat them quickly after ordering or they will get soggy. The chocolate sauce is so delicious, I wish I could buy a bottle of it! I loved the texture that the oreo topping added to the donut bites. I will definitely order this again when I come back!

Kataifi: These were also very crisp and definitely made fresh! The sauce on top was a thick custard that was only slightly sweet so this is a great option if you don't like sweet desserts. I loved the pistachio pieces on top because of both the texture and flavor but it mostly tasted of custard."
35,GRECO,5 star rating,11/26/2019,"Holy Zucchini!! Have you ever tried something you never thought of trying... and at the same time blew your mind and made you start questioning your life decisions? These zucchini fries did it for me. Oh my Buddha. Shemomechama.

Lately I have been obsessed with Greek culture- the people, the food, the atmosphere- which brought me here. "
36,GRECO,5 star rating,11/14/2020,"Don't have anything to add that hasn't been said already, but this place is a must try if you're living in the Boston area. I strongly recommend the veggie classic, but add spicy feta - delicious. My meat-loving friend had the bifteki, which he said was the softest beef he'd ever had, but after trying my gyro he actually decided he'd just stick with the veggie next time! We also tried the lamb classic, which was very good; the fries, which were a solid pick but definitely get a sauce to go with them; and the butternut squash soup, which was also amazing.

Lastly and maybe most importantly: the loukomas are divine. The blueberry lemon is my all time favorite but I always have trouble picking. Don't worry though - you're guaranteed to love them no matter which flavor you get."
37,GRECO,4 star rating,1/4/2020,"A bright little restaurant on a lower level of a building on Newbury street awaits you. The interior is simple, bright and amazing how efficient they are with the space. 

Ordered the chicken plate dinner. It comes with a side, choice of meat and sauce. The chicken was soft and juicy and delicious, the vulgar side was amazing as I have never had one that was so tasty and filled of great flavor. Loved the Tzatziki sauce with it and the combination was great.

So glad that I got to try this little gem, the staff made the experience even more pleasant. Loved it and highly recommend it!!"
38,GRECO,5 star rating,7/26/2019,"My boyfriend and I came here last weekend when it felt like 106 degrees outside. We got a Chicken Gyro Pork Gyro and a side of Fries. Everything tasted delicious! The Gyros were so neatly filled and wrapped. The people were pretty nice. They do have a single bathroom which was nice. Minimal seating with a cute atmosphere that reminded me of being in a stereotypical Greek woman's kitchen.

I don't come to Newbury Street often and I've have GreCo on my Bookmark list for ages. I'm so glad I was finally able to come. Everything we had so amazing and I look forward to coming back here one I'm in the area next time...preferably when it's not 96+ degree weather!"
39,GRECO,5 star rating,9/21/2021,"Great spot for lunch! Love the pita options, salads, bowls. Something for everyone on this menu!"
40,GRECO,5 star rating,5/14/2020,"Greco has been my life savior with having a great vegan option to order in during COVID. Thank you so much!! The staff are so nice, and are working really hard and deserve our support. 

#ThankYouThursday"
41,GRECO,5 star rating,7/10/2019,"Wow.

Wow.

Oh.... and wow.

Despite the ton of restaurants in the Back Bay where I live, I have to admit there are very few that are ""amazeballs"" in my book. Yes, we have some good places with an occasional great dish, but few that are just across-the-top great. GreCo, one of the new kids on the block (literally, not the boy band, idiot), is one of the few great ones.

I came here for lunch yesterday, after hearing my sister and brother-in-law singing praises about this place. I ordered the Horiatiki salad (tomato, cucumber, onion, kalamata olives, oregano, feta ) for myself and friend. For the kids, I ordered the lamb and pork plates with Tzatziki sauces, one with GreCo fries (with feta and oregano), the other with fried zucchini chips (OMG.....!!). Because of a nut allergy in the family, I ordered the only non-nut donut, the Bougatsa. I love that they also have authentic Greek beverages, as well as canned/bottled drinks, including this amazing rose-water lemonade.

This is honestly one of the BEST Greek eateries I've ever been to nationwide. Period. The meats are amazing. Sauces fantastic. Authenticity, on point. Service, friendly AF. Oh, and value for money? ON POINT!

So good was this place, that I came back for dinner..... AND I'M ON A DIET!!! Well.... I used to be.... apparently :)

Definitely one of my top recommendations for Boston. It's a full 5-star MUST-TRY."
42,GRECO,5 star rating,10/12/2021,"Greco is a fast-casual spot on Newbury Street that should not be missed. I'm a big fan of Greek food, but especially so for Greek food done right. Greco is delicious, authentic, and has so many good items on the menu you cannot go wrong. Their gyros have fries in them, which is so hard to find in the US but is the standard in Greece. The horiatiki (village salad) is a tomato salad without the greens base, again just like in Greece. This sweet find has massive portions that will keep you full, but try to save room for the loukoumadies (greek donuts) if you can!"
43,GRECO,5 star rating,11/11/2019,"This place is AUTHENTIC!! Run don't walk to get yourself a gyro from here! 

The flavor brought me right back to Chios island where I spent this past summer. It was incredible taste. Even the drink options: bottled water from Greece not Poland spring. If you're feeling creative I would recommend the Mastiha sparking water, it is a chios island staple drink. I couldn't believe they had it here, made me so happy to see. 

Vegan and vegetarian options, this place could not have been more up my alley. The zucchini cakes in the veggie gyro are sooo flavorful and authentic I could cry. Seriously so delicious. I would come here for lunch and dinner sooo much if I lived in the area. 

Table seats are limited but turnover is pretty quick. They have seating outside as well and even in the cold people were eating outside. The food is that good."
44,GRECO,5 star rating,6/11/2021,"Super yummy! We came during a heat wave and it was a bit too warm inside, but the food is great and they had some vegetarian options that were delicious. My favorite sauce was the spicy feta- everyone loved it after one bite. It was perfect for a quick lunch stop and would definitely eat again."
45,GRECO,4 star rating,7/31/2021,"We got the custom plate w/ pork, gyro and the santorini salad w/ lamb. This is a cozy little place w/ a fun menu. Unfortunately, I found the lamb to be way under-seasoned, somewhat gamey and pretty dry. I'm looking forward to trying the chicken next. I also tried the spicy feta sauce and it was good. My husband tried the loukaniko (pork & leek sausage) and he said that he has had better. He gave it 3.5/5. All that aside, they are pretty generous with the serving size and the prices are pretty decent for what you get. 

Home fries are delicious and I'd highly recommend wrapping up your meal with some of the classic doughnuts. 

Forgot to take pics!! :( next time!"
46,GRECO,4 star rating,1/24/2021,"Great place for Greek food! I ordered the Pork Gyro and Yaya's. The fries add a nice lemon flavor to the gyro along with the tzatziki sauce and fluffy pita! The donuts were also so yummy and sweet. Overall the food was fresh and good quality. Only downside is that it's a bit pricey, but still better than other places in Seaport."
47,GRECO,5 star rating,8/22/2019,"I was just strolling on Newbury Street and wanted a little snack and saw this place. I was debating between going back to a place that I've had before or trying something new and I went with a new place and it was well worth. I split the pork gyro and GreCo fries with my partner and it was the perfect amount of food to fill us up but not make us feel like a gross full. It was fresh and filling. 

Still thinking about my meal now and can't wait to go back."
48,GRECO,5 star rating,8/21/2019,"I got:
- Classic Pork Gyro ($9.50)
- Classic Loukoumas ($5.00)

Im so happy to find a place in newbury with great aesthetics and great food without it being overpriced!

I really liked the gyro but it could be a little oily. I combatted the greasiness with the hot sauce (shown on the photo). The hot sauce was on few tables so I'm sure if you cant find it, just ask! I also really liked the crunchiness of the fries in the gyro. But the real hype is the Loukoumas, aka greek donuts. It was my first time trying it but its freshly fried dough with honey and nuts sprinkled. I do not have a sweet tooth but this was actually so good. The aftertaste was SO clean. Even if you are not a gyro fan, you need to come here for the Loukoumas. The portions pretty big too!"
49,GRECO,4 star rating,7/18/2019,"My favorite gyro in the city! You really get a bang for your buck. The gyros always come out fresh, hot, and juicy. If you go, the zucchini chips are an absolute must! So crispy but still have enough zucchini to know you're not just eating batter.

Seating can get a little tough as they have such a small space, but great to grab and go in the warmer weather."
50,GRECO,4 star rating,6/19/2019,"A casual Greek eatery to get your gyro and pita bowl fix. 

Ordered an original pork gyro for pick up and it was ready by the time I arrived. 

I thought the gyro was pretty good, however I kind of felt like the french fries could be taken out and set aside as opposed to eating it inside the gyro. They didn't add to much to the gyro other than giving you a feeling of eating too many carbs. Once set aside, the gyro tasted a lot better! Wish the pork was seasoned a bit more and I really wished I ordered a side of fries - it looked super good. Will have to come back to try them!"
51,GRECO,4 star rating,4/15/2019,"Came here on a whim with my sister after dinner. I've heard about and seen photos of their loukoumades. We shared the Hellas Yeah, and wow! Super fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced. Definitely get it to share. 

With all its high-end shops and fine dining restaurants, Newbury Street can easily come off as an flashy and overpriced tourist trap. Not this place! Definitely coming back to try their regular food, and of course...for more loukoumades!"
52,GRECO,5 star rating,1/10/2019,"What an AmAzIng spot on Newbury!!! Â Definitely a must try and my new go-to! Â I love Greek food and here I have found an authentic, affordable and absolutely delicious spot to get it. Might I add, they have a beautifully done interior, which I love in a place. The interior and ambience match the great food. Well, the food was actually outstanding. I came in on a weekday around 5ish. The staff was incredibly friendly and walked me through the menu as I didn't quite know what I wanted. This menu allows you to ""build your own"" starting with a salad or pita etc.. I love having options :)

I got the vegetarian option which included zucchini fritters. A traditional Greek salad is the chopped tomatoes, chopped red onion, sliced cukes, olive oil, S&P, and Kalimantan olives. It was spot on and the topped fritters were lightly battered on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. Definitely a healthy option! Â 
I also got the zucchini fries with tzatziki sauce. Best tzatziki I've had. 
For dessert, my friend got the Loukoumades, which I tried. It's fried dough with sweet options on top. WOW! Â I tried the Yaya's with Oreo. So deliciously sweet and again, not too fried. Batter was light and sweet and a tiny bit crisp. 
All of the above, food, restaurant ambience, service, and price (under $20!) was awesome. 
AgAin... AmAzIng!"
53,GRECO,5 star rating,4/3/2021,I absolutely love Greco And have been going to both locations since they opened ( back bay and seaport ) . Even now will drive out of my way and look for parking uhhh Â ! Delicious and fresh and highly recommend
54,GRECO,1 star rating,6/8/2021,Their vegan fritters are burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. Not good at all. Would not recommend.
55,GRECO,4 star rating,3/11/2020,"Quick, easy, healthy, convenient, and delicious quick service food in the heart of Newburry Street! Â PSA- this restaurant is very very tiny with very very limited seating. Â I don't recommend coming here with more than two people, more of a ""to-go"" restaurant. Â However, during the Summer, I imagine more seating will open up on their outside patio.

I ordered the Â bowl with french fries, pita, and spicy feta sauce! Â It's a good sized portion at a decent cost. Â The spicy feta was good, however next time I will go with the tzatziki... I was looking for something more creamy! Â The french fries were my favorite part of the meal! Â They were sprinkled with Mediterranean seasoning and cheese, delicious!

I will be coming back here! Â The service and food were great! Â Looking to try a gyro next time."
56,GRECO,5 star rating,5/7/2021,So tasty. A great find with some outdoor seating. Quick service considering the number of people visiting. Loved it!
57,GRECO,4 star rating,11/8/2018,"Charming Greek sandwich spot in Backbay! Â Decent food at a reasonable price.

+. Â  Ambiance is trendy, charming and intimate fast casual resto. Â This place reminded me of a Georgetown row houses. Â The resto is below grade / basement of an old house and has a small sidewalk patio. Â  We were a group of 10 and had to put 3 tables together outside. Â When it began raining, their inside was very cramped. Â This is a good takeout place. 

+. Â  Food is Kabobs in pita, salads and soups. Â Their portions are decent. We had pretty much everything on the menu and they were all pretty good. Â 

+ Â  Â  Â Price is reasonable. Â

58,GRECO,5 star rating,11/1/2021,I love this place!!! The spreads are all amazing and I can never decide what to choose. Highly recommend the zucchini chips and whipped feta spread.
59,GRECO,5 star rating,11/18/2019,"This is a tiny little place in Newberry that's great for a quick bite! 

I recommend getting the pita since it's convenient and nicely wrapped if you're on the go. 

I've only had the chicken and I think it was juicy and well seasoned! And I absolutely love the fact there's french fries in it as well. 

All of the ingredients - chicken gyro, sauce, tomatoes, onion, and fries are well distributed so you get the perfect bite every time!

And if you want dessert, the loukoumas are a tasty treat, but make sure to eat them with a fork or you'll get your hands very sticky"
60,GRECO,4 star rating,12/28/2018,"Pros:
-Loukoumades!
-Cool vibe
-Outdoor seating in the summer
-Great service

Cons:
-Indoor seating works best for 2-3 people (one long table with immovable stools and a long bench work best for parties of 2)
-Wish they had nutrition info available!

Build Your Own Pita ($9.10)
Chicken/tomato/onion pita sans fries + sauce. The pita was soft and only a little chewy and the chicken was tender. No spice or anything to it. Nothing standout, but a a satisfying meal. It was a little too small too eat half of and take half to go, so I opted for eating it all and being slightly too full after. 

Classic Loukoumades ($5.35)
Greek-style fried dough balls (it comes with 7) topped with honey, walnuts, and cinnamon. They're served fresh and hot, but I found them to be better when I took the leftovers home and put them in the fridge because they felt less heavy that way. The outside has a bit of a crisp/chew and the inside is soft and fluffy. The texture was very reminiscent of sweet rice donuts except less chewy. I think honey was the ideal topping and added just the right amount of sweetness, but they offer many other topping options (including Greek hazelnut spread + Oreo) and you can even build your own."
61,GRECO,5 star rating,3/6/2020,"Omg I never knew pita could taste so good. Wowwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeee! 

Lots of sauce and tomato which usually lacks in a gyro in my opinion. The pork was crispy and fatty with just the right texture. Pita was hot and thick. I'd go there every day for lunch if I could."
62,GRECO,4 star rating,6/22/2020,This is definitely the lunch spot on Newbury. Great upgrade from the Chipotle lifestyle back in DC. The interior is quite clean and minimalist. Love the white toned colors and the bright mood inside. The staff is super friendly and quick on service. Been coming here recently and tried the plate with beef and lamb with fries. The fries are absolutely delicious - crunchy and crisp. The pita bread comes on the side so if you're a carb hungry monster this is your calling. The protein was pretty standard - definitely had softer elsewhere but still a solid choice. The most reasonable priced lunch on the street.
63,GRECO,4 star rating,9/16/2020,"GreCo is probably one of the best places to get some Greek food! We got the pork classic that comes with pork gyro, tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, onions, and fries, beftiki classic that comes with ground beef, spicy feta, tomatoes, onions, and fries, they come in a pita wrap and it's the perfect portion!The Greek donuts are amazing! We tried the classic (Greek honey, walnuts, cinnamon) and the yaya's(hazelnut praline, Oreo, powdered sugar). If you have a sweet tooth, you'll definitely love the yaya's!We'll definitely be coming back here!"
64,GRECO,5 star rating,7/22/2020,"5 stars for great vegetarian and vegan options. The squash fritters and pea protein keftides are awesome! Hopefully demand is strong enough to continue serving them. 

Nice ambience too and a small patio outside (though I usually order take out through the app)."
65,GRECO,5 star rating,5/17/2021,"If I was the last man on earth and could pick one place to eat every day until the end of time it'd be Greco,not only is the food phenomenal but the staff brings about an energy that just makes you feel at home,they've created an environment that anyone can feel comfortable in,and not just the newbury st location,the seaport one as well,like I don't even have to say my order they know when I walk in,they feel like family,anyways I love Greco and appreciate how they make me feel when I walk in their doors,8 outta 5 stars"
66,GRECO,5 star rating,9/3/2020,"Look no further for authentic greek food than right on Newbury. Fresh, fantastic, & fairly priced."
67,GRECO,5 star rating,8/15/2019,"A friend and I went to get pedicures together, but we both showed up too early and hunger took over, so we decided to stop in here. Unplanned visit! The place was not too crowded and looked inviting, so I was excited to try it out. 

The food... it was just so good. I got the squash fritter gryo and ohhhhhh it was mouth-wateringly delectable. The fritter was so creamy on the inside, crispy and not too greasy on the outside. The fries in the gyro were the star of the show, and I thought immediately that next time I come by I have to get an order of just the fries.

The food was fast, fresh, and too good not to go back and have again. I will definitely go again. And again."
68,GRECO,5 star rating,10/22/2020,"Probably the most authentic Gyro in Boston, I've try many gyros from many so called Originals!!! But nothing like Greco. Â They make their own meat on so it's not frozen but in fact layered and place in a slow cooker... Hand cut potatoes not too oily or overcook but fried perfect with a hint of Feta and oregano.... Absolutely tasty"
69,GRECO,5 star rating,11/20/2019,"Ordered delivery from GreCo on a weeknight was not disappointed. They prepared everything so quickly and everything was warm and at my door within 30 minutes. The build your own plate is the perfect size for dinner (or two lunches) and the pita/dip side was fantastic - we got the Greek fava dip which reminded me of an almost pumpkin-y spread and was delicious. 

I always pass by this place when I'm walking on Newbury and I'm so glad I finally decided to try it - highly recommend!"
70,GRECO,5 star rating,9/5/2019,"Their Greek donuts are definitely one of my favorite desserts on Newbury street! There are many different toppings that you can add to the Greek donuts and I personally think it's really good with honey especially. Donuts are so crispy and delicious. 

The place is a bit small but it's a great place to grab a quick bite and hangout with friends."
71,GRECO,5 star rating,11/2/2019,"SO. GOOD. I still think about this once a month because it was that great. Usually hesitant about restaurants/establishments on touristy streets, but this one is pretty solid. 

- Portions are a fantastic size. 
- Zucchini chips are delightful, nicely salted, and really crispy. The spicy feta sauce was super good and added so much flavor to the already delicious meat. 
- A decent price for all the food that you get!"
72,GRECO,5 star rating,9/1/2021,The food was top notch (authentic) and the service was fantastic!! Really really great. Would definitely recommend and go again.
73,GRECO,3 star rating,9/19/2020,"Tried takeout during COVID and was underwhelmed.

Expect more of a Moe's of Greek food and you will be content."
74,GRECO,5 star rating,9/26/2019,"Probably one of the best Greek eateries I've ever tried. I was staying near Copley Place so GreCo was easily walkable. Randomly found it on Yelp and I'm so glad I did. The food is simple, but very tasty. I decided to build my own salad, which came with one protein, one sauce, and some pita ($10.50). I chose the Mykonos salad with bifteki (ground beef) and tzaziki (cucumber yogurt sauce), and although it didn't seem like much, it was delicious. I highly recommend both the protein and the sauce. The balsamic dressing for the salad complemented everything perfectly as well. You can also build your own pita or plate if you don't want a salad.

It's small so there's not much seating, but it's fast dining. People tend to grab 'n go as well. Loved that it's on Newbury street so you can take a nice stroll after your meal."
75,GRECO,5 star rating,10/18/2019,"Literally my favorite spot for food. I've gone to the other location near seaport boulevard twice, but when I came here this one was closer and I didn't want to go much farther into the city and I wanted to check out the new location. 
First off, the decor in this place is so cool! I love it. It's a lot smaller than the other one but I like the style a lot better. 
When I went, it was pretty busy especially for the time! The line moved pretty fast though. It's not like the other Greco where it's like a subway style where they move you down the line. At this location, there is a guy at the register and you just tell him what you want and he puts it into the register (like regular businesses usually). The food is done in about like five minutes not even. 
The service is really good! Not really much to say about it but the food is just phenomenal. It blows me away every time. I get the pork gyro which comes with fries inside!! It also comes with tomatoes, onions, tzatziki and I'm not sure on anything else. The pork is my favorite. I've also tried the chicken which is pretty good too!

I wish they had locations closer to me, but it's so worth the hour drive if you have a free day!"
76,GRECO,3 star rating,8/1/2021,"We always ordered Greco via delivery. Unfortunately, the food has been inconsistent in terms of portions and quality. For example, the tatziki in the pork gyro today was much more liquid and runny than prior times."
77,GRECO,4 star rating,10/14/2019,"Yummy yummy! The gyros here are delicious but a bit expensive for the portion size. Two gyros run you about 21 dollars. 
I got the classic chicken and my husband got the classic pork and both were very tasty. It was a bit crowded when we went (Monday around 1pm) and the seating options are limited, especially if the weather isn't nice. The line goes very quickly though so we didn't wait long to order or get our food.
The restaurant is small and I wouldn't recommend for a big group if you are looking to sit and eat. It is very much a fast casual Greek place if you are looking for a quick lunch that doesn't feel like you are overdoing it."
78,GRECO,4 star rating,5/15/2019,"Came here for dinner on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed! The interiors are a bit tightly packed but modern. There was a bit of a wait to place an order on a weekday night. I asked the lady taking orders whether the chicken had garlic or onion, and she was very helpful and accommodating about making substitutions. I got the Mykonos salad with lemon yogurt and chicken and a side of zucchini chips as per her recommendation. The salad was fresh, flavorful, and filling. I loved the scoop of creamy lemon yogurt, and the chicken was flavorful and tender, and there was a lot of it. I didn't have room for the zucchini chips until later, when they had gotten a bit cold, but they were still pretty good, albeit a bit greasy. Would recommend trying this place out!"
79,GRECO,5 star rating,6/22/2019,"Haven't been out on Newbury Street in a while and didn't know this place existed until a few days ago when I saw it on Yelp.

It's downstairs pretty close to Zara right amongst all of the shops, and is a small fast casual sort of place. Vibe reminds me of a Shake Shack for gyros.

In any case the food was really delicious and surely hit the spot! The Pork Gyro was delicious and had the classic accoutrements like tomatoes, tzatziki and onions, while the Chicken Gyro had the same but with honey mustard sauce. They were just the right amount for dinner with a side of fries to share for two.

The shop wasn't that busy and there was plenty of seating, although it is mostly communal tables and bars. They do have a small patio up top that is nice too. Cute decor in the shop with little Greek motifs!

This place was perfect for a quick, not too expensive, tasty meal."
80,GRECO,4 star rating,3/25/2018,"BEAUTIFUL decor and layout at Gre.Co. They did a lot for such a tiny space. I felt like I was on Apartment Therapy- tiny spaces edition! 

The menu prices were affordable, especially for Newbury Street. I was pleased. However, I ordered terribly. I should have ordered the lamb jam gyro (which my husband ordered) but ordered a plate instead. I got chicken, spicy feta, pita, and zucchini chips. I was desperate to try those zucchini chips. I also ordered Yaya's Loukoumades for dessert. 

The chicken was good but not as great as the lamb. The spicy feta with the chicken was a salt bomb but the zucchini chips were everything and what saved me in the end. Yaya's oreo and hazelnut sauced crisp but soft donuts made me swoon!! What a treat- so delicious. 

I would definitely come back here for a quick dinner or lunch to go. The portions and affordable prices matched perfectly for me. This spot gets very busy so it is hard to nab a spot to sit inside but nice because there is outside seating as well!"
81,GRECO,5 star rating,8/29/2019,"I was looking for a casual lunch to take on the go and found this place on yelp. I love Mediterranean food so decided to give it a shot and I'm glad I did! The guy at the register was helpful in explaining the menu. Since I wasn't starving, I opted for a chicken pita with tzatziki sauce. It was warm, flavorful, and delicious. It was also the perfect portion for lunch and didn't leave me in a food coma. If I'm back in the area, I'll be back!"
82,GRECO,4 star rating,2/19/2018,"Gre.Co for lunch on a Monday and it was great. We both got gyros, which are probably close to Greek style but they're different. I got mine with a red sauce and lamb. The lamb was tender and juicy, the gyro had enough onion in it plus a smattering of tasty salty fries. Delish.

Mom got the chicken gyro and enjoyed hers, also with fries but tzatziki sauce.

Gre.Co is a small joint, only a couple of two-top tables and a counter. A table outside would be nice on a nice day.

A pretty good sandwich for around $10."
83,GRECO,5 star rating,9/5/2020,Tried GreCo today for the first time. I have to say it is the best best gyro I have had in Boston! Perfect on the go lunch while on Newbury Street. Will definitely be back MANY times!
84,GRECO,3 star rating,5/31/2019,"Solid option for casual greek food on Newbury Street, but I felt like I was missing something from my gyro. I think it's because I usually have some sort of fries in my gyro, and the sauce wasn't particularly tasty. I do appreciate the decent portions, so this will be a good place to go whenever I'm in a pinch to get some comforting greek food; but it's not somewhere I'll be craving going forward. 

This is mainly a takeout place, although there are tables inside and outside to enjoy your gyro if you want to."
85,GRECO,5 star rating,12/11/2017,"That classic lamb gyro! So good! Great lunch spot; line moved quick and our order came up relatively soon.

My memories of this place are filled with one regret: that smell of those delicious fries with the tzatziki sauce that I didn't have! Yup, should have got the fries.

The lamb gyro was succulent and delicious. The meat is carved right off the skewer and the gyro was full of delicious tomato, onion and served on a delicious warm pita. There were some fries inside the pita, but it just wasn't the same as having my own side order.

Oh, that red paprika hot sauce? That was bomb. A little spicy, but so asdfsdf delightful. Go get it!"
86,GRECO,5 star rating,12/12/2017,"To me a good lunch hits three important criteria:
1. It's around the $10 mark.
2. It's quick to get.
3. It's painfully filling.

And Gre.Co hits all of that: the long line is misleading because of how efficiently they're actually turning over (accurate) orders, the gyros (for example) are all under a Hamilton and they're also the size of a Gaston's forearm.

What to expect? If you're getting a Gre.Co Classics then big, hearty, flavorful pitas overflowing with fresh tomatoes and onions, an abundance of thick hand-cut french fries, and - for me - positively enormous and delicious seasonal squash fritters that were cooked to perfection.

But the icing on the cake (and I would actually eat a cake that had this as the icing)? The spicy whipped feta. I will think about that spicy whipped feta in days and weeks and years to come when I'm choking down some miserable lunch option that would probably be improved with a big old smear of that stuff. I got a side of it, and it was absolutely the star of the show. It came in maybe a four ounce container and was thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick (like, get a knife, because this stuff isn't moving. ever.). I put it on my sandwich, I put it on fries (more like, I put my fries on it), I ate it with a spoon. It's cool, it's creamy, it's feta-y, it's got some sweet heat from peppers. It's perfection.

Lunch from here is a definite win."
87,GRECO,4 star rating,12/7/2017,"Beautifullly simple Greek fare with classic roots. A few extremely comfortable seats in the small space., but once you see the food presented, you'd have a hard time venturing far before diving in. 

I went classic pork gyro, which is a hearty portion of shaved pork gyros on a warm pita with tsatziki, tomatoes and onion. Bonus: nicely crisped fries in varying quantity (a lunching colleague snagged twice the volume in their wrap).

Beverages include imported cans and bottles, soft drinking anything from tea to lemon sodas. Refreshing!

The best value comes from the plate option: the most expensive at $11, but ample in serving size, and getting the zucchini chips as a side option is straight baller country. Get them. 

Huge fan of the paprika hot sauce scattered through the dining area. Meat's a little dry, but all in all, super flavorful and an easy lunch option in the area."
88,GRECO,5 star rating,4/4/2019,"Ummm, I love this place more than I thought I ever would. My first yummy encounter here was on a whim. My boyfriend and I were on a hunt for something relatively cheap [for the area], fast and within walking distance. Not only did this place meet all of those requirements, it exceeded any and all expectations! I've never been super impressed with food options on Newbury. Like nothing has ever tasted amazing or made me want more until GreCo!

Love love love this place!!!

All of the classics on the menu are superb. My faves are the classic veggie and the classic lamb. I also obsessed with the zucchini chips! The greek doughnuts are also amazing. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

This establishment has become a staple in my book. The staff is so friendly. The place is super cute and clean. I'm always happy after every inhalation of food from GreCo!"
89,GRECO,5 star rating,7/7/2021,"The pork gyro is really really good. Definitely the best gyro I've ever had. I went during lunch time and all the tables were occupied (it's a pretty small place), but it's definitely a great spot for takeout."
0,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/9/2022,"I had the distinct advantage of staying in a nearby hotel and got up early and walked around and then Yelped breakfast options. This original location was at the top of the list. They opened at 7:30 am so I had to return after that time (told you I got up early!).

This place had great breakfast sandwiches and as I waited for my order inside this tiny original location, I watched non-stop foot traffic coming and going with orders. It is a very popular place.

I had the Yelpers-recommended Breakfast Grilled Crack sandwich which has fried egg, two slices of bacon, and 4 cheeses! (American, Â Cheddar, Swiss & Gruyere). All this served on a buttered Flourhouse Sourdough toasted bread. This sandwich can fill one up for 2 days and there's enough fat in it to keep a bear well hibernated for Winter. But, oh is it good! Freshly made by a jolly crew in a historic building adds to the flavor. 

Give this place a try when in the Theater District/Chinatown areas in Boston and you and your waistline will thank me later!"
1,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/8/2022,"If you haven't been to Mike and Patty's, you're missing out. Â They have the best egg sandwiches in town. Â Even the vegan sandwich is amazing.

Staff is always super friendly. Â SMALL. Â Be prepared to not be able to sit, so you will have to take your sandwich to go."
2,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,3/22/2022,"Delicious sandwiches, amazing staff. This place was near my Hotel in Boston, stopped by one morning and had to come back the next morning for another one. The staff even remembered me and gave me advice for my trip. I had the fancy and then the fancy with turkey and they were both spectacular. Honorary mention to their chamomile and lemon tea blend.

Side note: can be a little expensive for a student, traveler budget but I think it was worth it."
3,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,3/21/2022,"Get the Vegan Sandwich:) it's so unique and delicious. I love the corn English muffin that's on the outside and the inside has mushroom and melted cheese that together it's a great combo:) 

Cute place only allows two people to go in and pick up the food. 

4 star bc the coffee was definitely not good. Could do better if they had better coffee to go with the perfect breakfast sandwich. 

I also love the neighborhood it's in. Super cute and historic."
4,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,3/17/2022,Quick stop for a breakfast sandwich. I loved the English muffin. Wish there was a little more pizazz in flavor but overall it was really good.
5,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/31/2021,"Friend and I ordered the fancy and grilled crack. Both were simply delicious, but I liked the fancy more because it was lighter. Avocado worked well to balance the cheese/bacon and eggs. I usually don't like mayo, but something about their mayo just works, maybe it's not mayo. If you'd like a heart attack, definitely go for grilled crack. Both taste better with hot sauce!!
Store is super cute and on a picturesque street. Ordering is quite easy, but they get pretty busy, so expect a wait."
6,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,11/17/2021,"Yummm who's down for breakfast grilled cheese? Because that's what this place is all about. They're located in a tiny shop in a residential area. You'll find them because there is probably a line around the corner. 

You can order to go from an app... but they do a pretty good job of getting orders out quickly if you walk up and order. Only two people are allowed in the shop at a time, then you'll wait outside for them to call your name with your order.

I got the breakfast crack. It was bomb. Ill totally be coming back here."
7,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,11/10/2021,"We ordered the Breakfast Grilled Crack Sandwich and the Fancy Sandwich -- both so yummy and cheesy! 

There was a line outside when we arrived but the wait was not bad at all and the food came out within a couple minutes. Overall, really cute store, Â friendly workers and delicious breakfast sandwiches!"
8,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/8/2022,I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The staff are incredibly friendly and the food is so good! Amazing value for the price! I got the grilled crack and added avocado and it was fantastic!! Can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu!
9,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/11/2022,"Literally the best breakfast I have ever had, no exaggeration. And the location is so cool, I will definitely be back!!!! (Maybe tomorrow) YOU MUST VISIT!"
10,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,10/23/2021,"Omg! Â The BEST breakfast sandwiches, hands down! Â We saw this little shop on Tik Tok and had to go while we were in Boston! Â You can order the sandwiches to-go or wait in line. Â Trust me, it was definitely worth the wait!

We had the ""Fancy"" which was fried egg, bacon, avocado, and some sort of delicious spiced Mayo. Â We also had the ""Grilled Crack"". Â It was amazing!! Double bacon and triple cheese with egg, all on sourdough. Â This one was my absolute fave!! They also have fresh squeezed juice to go!"
11,Mike & Patty's - Boston,3 star rating,4/10/2022,Ordered their food online so can't speak to the restaurant itself but the food was just average. We ordered breakfast sandwiches and they hardly had any egg and it was mostly just a grilled cheese. I would maybe suggest trying it in person for a better experience.
12,Mike & Patty's - Boston,2 star rating,9/12/2021,"Given the high reviews for Mike and Patty's, I was expecting to be blown away by the breakfast sandwiches with something unique or great, but felt let down with pretty standard breakfast sandwich fare.

Mike and Patty's is a tiny hole in the wall shop that cranks out take out breakfast orders that are taken either online or in-person. Â Even getting there at an early hour, there was clearly a high demand for this popular breakfast spots food as the wait times were around twenty to thirty minutes from the time of ordering. Â 

Ordered the Torta and Grilled Crack which from Yelp were the most popular recommended items. Â The torta had a nice runny egg with well cooked potatoes, but needed more salsa or beans to provide extra flavor. Â The grilled crack was definitely the better sandwich with crisp bacon that served as the perfect contrast to the mix of melted cheeses. Â Unfortunately, the sandwich did not feel worth the $10 as it was pretty small.

Parking is very limited here! Â Better off walking over.

Overall, Mike and Patty's is a standard breakfast sandwich place that you can consider if you are in the area, but otherwise, it is okay if you have other places you would like to try in the Boston area."
13,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,9/20/2021,"Best breakfast sandwich in Boston. I dream about their sandwich: ""The Fancy."" It's literally gold: a perfect combination of fresh bread, fluffy eggs, crispy bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, and the house mayo that brings the whole sandwich together to EXPLODE inside your mouth. 

Definitely worth the $11 dollars per sandwich. Very filling, the best way to start your day."
14,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/23/2022,"You might miss it when you're walking through the cobblestone neighborhoods of Bay Village but Mike & Patty's is a MUST if you're looking for quality breakfast sandwiches containing ingredients from locally sourced farms and vendors!

My personal favorite is the Fancy! The Fancy is sure to satisfy that morning hunger with two perfectly fried eggs, crispy bacon pieces, melted cheddar cheese, red onions, and their amazing house-Mayo on toasted multigrain bread (oh and I can't forget the the avocado which is what makes this sandwich oh so fancy). 

Pop on over to the Church St location where you'll be in a quintessential Boston neighborhood! My boyfriend and I enjoyed our sandwiches in a cute little park nearby!"
15,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/30/2021,"The Fancy sandwich is so good! The fresh avocado is a must as it balances the saltiness from the bacon, cheese and egg so well. Love the multigrain bread too. A bit pricey for the size, but I'd happily go again."
16,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,8/25/2021,"I'm still dreaming about their breakfast sandwiches. The most glorious, cheesiest sandwiches I've had and I'm so jealous of the Boston locals who can get this every week. I think there's usually a long line out the door but we came at a good time with only 2 parties ahead of us. The shop is small but the workers are efficient with loads of eggs and bacon and bread on the grill. 

We ordered the Fancy and the Breakfast Grilled Crack to share and walked to the nearby park to enjoy. Wow, literally so good. Ugh I'm actually salivating thinking about it. Both sandwiches were delicious but I loved the Fancy just a tad bit more. The red onions really elevated the sandwich to the next level since the acidity and bite of the onions helped to cut the grease of all that cheese and bacon. 

I would make a stop here every time I'm in Boston hands down."
17,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,9/13/2021,"A bit on the heavy end for breakfast, but when you're coming in from out of town...this is the best way to start your day cause carbs don't count on vacation. A cute little shop in Bay Village. Eggs are cage free locally sourced ingredients. Shared half and half with my partner so i could taste everything. 

Must try the Fancy & Grilled Crack."
18,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/26/2021,"the best breakfast sandwich in boston. The Fancy is amazing: multigrain with smashed avocado, perfectly cooked egg, cheddar, onion, and their house-made mayo that's so good they sell jars to take home. located on a picturesque street, it's a must-try"
19,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,1/14/2022,"Haven't ordered from here in a long time! But remembered the last time I ordered a breakfast sandwich it was phenomenal! So this morning while at work was hungry for a satisfying breakfast sandwich and ordered the Grilled Crack fried egg, 2x bacon, american, cheddar and gruyere
on buttered sourdough! So delicious omg they make a mean sandwich! And ordered the Baller acorn-fed IbÃ©rico de Bellota bacon, fried egg and
Vermont cheddar aged 24 months on our house-
made english muffin! This is my new favorite breakfast sandwich so so goood!!!! Great spot glad I ordered again from Mikes & Patty's!"
20,Mike & Patty's - Boston,3 star rating,2/28/2022,"There were some very apparent pros and cons for Mike and Patty's. 

The pros: 1) amazing food. The sandwiches we got were some of the best breakfast sandwiches we've had in Boston. 2) great location in a cute neighborhood. 

The cons (which is what drops it down to three stars): 1) the service was not great. My friend has a few dietary restrictions and they didn't really work with us to customize a sandwich. She ultimately had to go to another place to get food. 2) wait-times were much longer than they suggested... 25 min wait vs 10 min estimate.

With those pros and cons in mind, I would recommend to anyone who isn't in a rush and has little to no dietary restrictions."
21,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,8/30/2021,"Visit: first (all the way from Miami)

Food: I had the Fancy w everything I did change the bread out for the english muffin (i do recommend if youre trying to have a ""smaller"" portion)
The bacon was to die for, THEIR mayo OMG sooo good and gives it a nice kick but not too much, the guac, egg and cheese was just perfect! 
My husband had the Robbie (used ham instead of bacon) he is so picky but legit almost ate the foil
This is very filling so def go hungry!
We had the coffee BUT be careful this is strong and legit I almost passed out lol so just be careful and stay hydrated 

Atmosphere: tiny hole in the wall but these are the best! 2 ppl in at a time due to covid, gets packed sooo def go early or atleast know what you want. They have no seating but its the cutest street so we loved eating standing up, than walked to the cutest benches

Staff: we were helped by Richie (tall, white fella who was awesome and even gave us stickers)

Will def return on our next Boston trip!"
22,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/8/2021,"After wondering about Mike & Patty's for quite awhile, I finally had the opportunity to stop by (note to self, as w/most busy places: stopping by on the weekdays is ideal). I tried the Crack, and it was delicious--hot off the grill, and very gooey with delicious cheeses and crispy bacon. As others have noticed, parking in the area is definitely tight, and I can imagine on weekends, this whole block must be packed. But if you're able to find a quiet moment and head over, it's well worth it. Hopefully I'll have the chance to be back soon and try some of the other options!"
23,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,5/23/2021,"This place is tucked away in a quiet corner. It's ALMOST hard to miss if not for the long line outside! Takeout/delivery only right now. I recommend ordering ahead of time though their website to avoid waiting in the line outside.

I tried the Jersey Shore $9 (sesame roll, fried egg, pork, american cheese, red onions, house mayo). A lot of the sandwiches on the menu have very similar components. It was delicious! The cheese melted nicely and I thought that they added an appropriate amount of red onions-- not too many, but enough to contribute to the flavor. The house mayo is a tiny tiny bit spicy and full of flavor. You can choose how your eggs are cooked. The bread was good but next time I want to try one of their grilled sandwiches.

Quite pricey for a breakfast sandwich of this size, but I could definitely see myself coming back. I can't think of another place in Boston that makes sandwiches as well as Mike & Patty's, where every part of the sandwich is done well!"
24,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,11/21/2021,"Food: 4/5. The sandwich is very tasty. I ordered the Fancy: Good freshly smashed avocado; 2 over easy eggs (you can choose how you want the egg done when ordering, highly recommend over easy because the yolk literally drips down the sandwich when you bite and that's the best). crispy bacon. and what add to the taste of the sandwich is the house mayo (it has an orange color, taste like a non-spicy spicy mayo used in spicy tuna roll; maybe something taste like a combination of thousand island salad dressing and mayo);
the house made english muffin is 5/5. $6 for a bag of four; very thick and fluffy english muffin; very buttery and give you a tang taste. They taste perfect freshly out of bag even without toasting! LOVE them!
However, other factors of the shop is not that great: 
Location: 2/5 (extremely difficult to find parking)
Indoor atmosphere: 1/5 (in door seats, this tiny shop literally only has a kitchen, you will have to order you food and wait outside; that's why try to order online beforehand; and knowing that the uber eats price is $2 than their online ordering portal price)
Price: 1/5. $10 for a very tiny sandwich that's literally your palm size. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich tasted good. so if you are in a rush in the morning, lives in the neighborhood, but still want to grab a good sandwich, def visit this shop!"
25,Mike & Patty's - Boston,1 star rating,7/27/2021,"Super rude service. As a vegetarian there's only 1 thing on the menu that I can eat (and it didn't sound very appealing, see picture). When I asked to replace bacon with avocado, they said said no - we can only remove the bacon but will charge you the same. They charge $2 for extra bacon, just in case you wonder..
In general they were not so yet nice and didn't even give me a second to order coffee. 
Ended up with a pretty mediocre overpriced Torta.
Will not be back :("
26,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/6/2022,I got the Fancy sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. The homemade mayo is slightly smokey and just perfect on the sandwich. 11/10 would recommend this place to anyone looking for a breakfast sandwich in Boston.
27,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,3/29/2022,"Best breakfast sandwiches in the world. Jk, can't confidently say that because I haven't had them all. But best I've ever had and for sure the best in Boston. Pricey but doesn't matter because it's worth it."
28,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/20/2022,"I am pretty sure they gave me the ring bread, and I am not a fan of rye. Despite that, it was incredible! I love their menu with options for all palates. The bread is baked to perfection. 
On busy days, highly recommend ordering ahead, as the wait can be long. I am not surprised because they quality of the sandwiches shows that they take their time making each order. Highly recommend."
29,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,1/31/2022,So delicious! We came on a Friday morning and only had to wait about 10 minutes for our order. I got the Fancy and it was so good. I definitely understand the hype fine this place.
30,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/7/2022,"Just another review affirming all of the other 5 stars about ""blah blah blah best sandwiches in Boston,"" ""worth going out of your way for,"" etc. etc. 
M&P has def't refined their craft and it's worth hitting up, esp their breakfast sandwich game."
31,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/22/2021,"The classic egg and cheese on an English muffin with avocado and a San Pellegrino??? FUGGET ABOUT IT 
HIT THE SPOT
Two thumbs up"
32,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,3/14/2021,"People aren't kidding when they say this place has the best breakfast sandwiches! Mike and Patty's is located on the corner of a building in a super cute neighborhood between Back Bay and Chinatown. It's a 25 minute walk from my apartment so I decided to order ahead of time so that it would be ready. There were a few people standing outside waiting for their order so we jumped in line. It only too like 3 minutes. The inside is extremely small, so it's definitely a grab and go type place. 

We took our sandwiches to the commons and they were still nice and hot by the time we go there. I got the fancy sandwich but customized it. I got chorizo instead of bacon, and got over hard eggs instead of over easy. It was seriously SO good! Like I should have ordered two for myself. Now that I have finally tried this place, it will definitely become a weekend go to."
33,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,5/20/2021,"As soon as I arrived to Boston I found my way to Mike & Patty's. Very small place, everyone was doing pick up. 

I ordered the torta and the grapefruit juice. The customer service was great, the guys were working non stop. 

The torta was ok. I added chorizo to mine. The reason why I say it is ok is because I felt that the bread would shadow the flavor of the chorizo, egg, avocado and cheese. I'm that type of person that makes the bum skinnier when making a burger. I also eat my tacos with only one tortilla, two is too much. So, it is all based on my own preference. Next time I go I will ask them to give me white bread instead of the bum, hope that's a possibility. 

But besides that, they have been able to make a desirable combination of flavors in a torta. 

I would go back."
34,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,10/10/2021,"This place is ALWAYS packed when I walk by and now I know why! I got the ""fancy"" breakfast sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. I ordered online and my order was a bit delayed but given the crown outside, i understand. 

My boyfriend got the breakfast burrito and that was amazing too! Can't wait to come back"
35,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,10/8/2021,"My first review of this place was before I really had a concept of Yelp and my own rating scale. I am here after my second experience at Mike & Patty's to inform everyone that it is definitely 5-star worthy. Best breakfast sandwiches in Boston, prove me wrong. And yes, we were given many napkins this time. Either they were having an off day last time, or they took my review to heart. Regardless, a messy girl can appreciate."
36,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,9/25/2021,"The best sandwich at mike and patty's is the fancy, so if you are wondering what to get, get that! That being said, the breakfast sandwiches here are basically really good versions of what you can make at home. Regular sliced bread, egg and cheese, bacon and avocado, and pretty much anything else you can think of. They have potatoes, black beans, pico, just a few examples as add ons. It is really good but only 4 stars because it is nothing you can't make at home, and 9$ is a steep price for a bacon egg and cheese on toast."
37,Mike & Patty's - Boston,2 star rating,3/16/2022,"We went for breakfast our first morning in Boston. It quickly became apparent this is a tourist trap. While many people were there, no one was local. Also, there's no eating in and only 2 people can enter at a time. You have to wait outside for your order. Not knowing this, we ordered and trudged back to the hotel (thankfully it was really close) and ate in the hotel lobby. The breakfast sandwiches were ok....nothing to rave about. Everything has eggs and my son has an egg allergy so I was nervous even though they remembered to not out eggs on his sandwich. Â All in all, it was food. The coffee was delicious though."
38,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,3/19/2022,Great little hole in the wall! Highly recommend ordering ahead since the line can get long. Sandwiches were perfectly cooked and just enough food where you don't feel uncomfortable after you eat.
39,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/8/2022,"What a perfect breakfast. The sandwiches were lights out delicious, highly recommend adding in a hash brown and getting some fresh squeezed juice to go with it. Thanks Mike & Patty's! 11/10!"
40,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,10/18/2021,"I had the best sandwich I have ever had in my life. No exaggeration. The breakfast grilled crack sandwich changed me and I don't think any sandwich will ever compare. I did try their fancy sandwich.... but the former is so much better. The sandwich is cooked to perfection and is huge! I have a big appetite, but had to save the second half for later. Try to go at an off time (unless you don't mind waiting awhile) because there is usually a small crowd (mix of people waiting to order and people waiting on their order) outside the shop. There is not enough room to wait inside the store so they will open the door and call out names when your order is ready."
41,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,10/9/2021,"Mike and Patty's does delicious on the go breakfast sandwiches. It's a little hole in the wall just south of Back Bay and the Public Garden. I got the Fancy which is two fried eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, red onion and house-mayo on toasted multigrain. It was delicious and filling - a perfect breakfast."
42,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,8/9/2021,"How good can a sandwich be? Freaking amazing at Mike & Patty's. If you're from out of town and had only 1 meal to have. Mike and Patty's is worth that much. It's definitely a must try restaurant in Boston.

We stopped by during a 13 state road trip along the east coast and this was easily in our top 5 favorite meals and we had a lot of meals at all the must try places. 

We ordered the Fancy and the grilled crack. There are no words in the English dictionary that could come close to describing how good these two sandwiches were. Simply put, if foodgasm was a thing, this would be it. 

I'm so jealous of the locals living here, this place would be a regular spot and worth driving and dealing with traffic for. Will be visiting again the next time I'm in Boston."
43,Mike & Patty's - Boston,2 star rating,9/23/2021,"Overrated. This place was a huge disappointment. It's like no one ate a good grilled cheese sandwich before reading the ratings. Tiny hole in the wall (size of a living room) with no place to sit or eat inside or out. Have to take it to go. Unfriendly and rushed service with no greetings and curt answers. I got the ""crack"" sandwich since that's the most popular one. What I got was super salty grilled cheese with overcooked egg (hard yolk) and wilted bacon. Bread was a standard piece of sliced bread and was burnt on one end. How does a sandwich place screw up a sandwich so badly?! Coffee was premade and mediocre. It was expensive for such a small sandwich too ~$10. The only positive was they got my order right."
44,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,7/24/2021,Our first visit to Boston; looking for local favorites to eat at. Got off trolly stop 13 and walked to this place because of the awesome reviews. We didn't realize it was take out only. The flavor is definitely worth the wait and eating on the curb. My granddaughter ordered the jersey shore; pork roll egg and cheese on a sesame bun. She loved it! They didn't have gluten -dairy free options so We are walking to the Boston Commons area so I can brunch at Cafe Bonjour. I did take a bite and it was scrumptious; brought me back to my years living on the jersey shore and this was my go to sandwich most days; very delicious
45,Mike & Patty's - Boston,3 star rating,7/23/2021,"My boyfriend has been dying to come here so we finally did. Around 10 AM the place was packed already. Everybody was so busy running around that it took a while to get seated. The waitress we had was very nice and despite being busy, she was still very attentive to us. The food was alright, I wasn't excited about it."
46,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,8/14/2021,"Really good breakfast sandwiches! Small shop at a corner and seems very popular. I got take out so the bread was a little soggy but the flavor was all there! If it wasn't on the more expensive side for a small to normal size, I would say it's worth it. It's definitely something you could make at home but if you're in the area, I would definitely pick up"
47,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,7/8/2021,"I got their fancy sandwich without bacon and it was SO GOOD! Look how the cheese melts and their sauce was delicious! I finished this in minutes!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! 

PRO TIP: Order online prior to going since during busy times the wait can take up to 30 minutes! I had to walk into the store to get updates on my order and he expedited my order."
48,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,6/27/2021,"Located in a small off main road street, Mike and Patty's is only for pickup. They serve some delicious breakfast sandwiches and wraps. We got the Fancy and Torta with chorizo. I got the fancy and it was perfect for me. Not too much bacon, avocado or egg and everything was perfectly portioned on multigrain toasted bread. My sister got the Torta and she enjoyed hers a lot too. Perfect portions yet again. So if you like over the top bacon, you can request more or maybe go for one of their other sandwiches, I think Grilled Crack had 2x bacon. 

We ordered online and picked up and it was ready to go when we got there. We did not order beverages there, but I was tempted to get their fresh squeezed grapefruit. 

I'd say there isn't much parking there, so order ahead so you can do a quick grab and dash."
49,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/2/2020,"This little gem for an amazing breakfast sandwich is off the beaten path for sure. Â In between the Back Bay and Chinatown, I would recommend an Uber or Lyft there.

Anywho, talk about a Fantastic, FANTASTIC!! breakfast sandwich called ""Fancy."" Â I was discouraged to go here because all the pictures all looked the same including mine, but let me tell you, there is a reason that everyone shares the same picture, is because this sandwich is SO, SO, good. Â I'm not sure if they use magic dust in it or what, but take my word for it and make your way over to this TINY corner place to grab yourself a heck of a breakfast sandwich!"
50,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/6/2021,5 stars! It's got great reviews for a reason. Make sure to order the house mayo on whatever sandwich you order and the English muffins are so yum.
51,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,5/17/2021,"Definitely check this place out!

On that note, definitely place your order in advance online to avoid a lengthy wait. This place was packed outside with at least 20 people actively waiting for their food at any point in time whether for themselves or deliveries. My wife and I were looking to get our day started right and this place was close by so we figured we'd give it a go. This place is currently operating as takeout only, but don't let that dissuade you from giving it a try. I ordered the breakfast torta with chorizo and it was incredible. It has to be the top breakfast sandwich I've ever had. Each piece fit together perfectly and made it outstanding. Staff was very friendly as well. This place is a must visit if you are close by and haven't given it a try!"
52,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,5/2/2021,"Always a good sign when there's a long line for a restaurant. When in Boston, I found this place on yelp. Based on the outstanding reviews I was in the mood for something between breakfast and lunch. I settled on a sandwich called crack- which it most certainly is! The sourdough bread was toasted and buttery. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the bacon delicious. The restaurant has an excellent cadence Â for serving guests Â during Covid. Â There was no seating inside so I sat on the sidewalk and enjoyed my delicious sandwich."
53,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"Yep 10/10 amazing. Super quaint little place in the middle of a gorgeous neighborhood! The food was excellent. Definitely comfort food. Food is made to order so it's nice and fresh. 

There's no seating, but there's a little community garden near by that is a wonderful spot to eat! 

We ordered the crack sandwich which was YUMMM! Some avocado with it would be so delish! Everyone that works there is sweet and helpful! We definitely will be back :)"
54,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,10/4/2021,"GREAT a breakfast sandwiches!! 
*order on line, and pick up! Super smooth transition and awesome food!!
Crack sandwich is AWESOME! Ate our sandwiches before I could get a picture!"
55,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,6/27/2021,"Long line this morning... but worth the wait. The kids devoured their Classics, the wife loved her Cracked, I had a Classic with grilled onions and potatoes today (it was delicious), and AvÃ³ had a Classic with grilled onion and avacado. It was AvÃ³'s firat time here and she was surprised how good the English muffin was. Remember to pre-order on their website before you arrive to speed up the process."
56,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/20/2021,"Holy deliciousness. The grilled crack sandwich.... perfect from top to bottom. With 3 cheeses (cheddar, gruyere and cheddar), egg and 2x bacon.... cannot go go wrong. The buttery sourdough just seals the deal. A light crispy crunch on the outside and then you bite into melty cheesy heaven. Unbelievable. A quaint little spot, so it is better to order ahead then grab it and go eat on a local bench or at the park. Super fast and pleasant service. Would 100% recommend, no questions asked!"
57,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/25/2022,Great food!!! I found a usual breakfast spot to go to :) was so full from the sandwich. Coming back again! Thank youu
58,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,10/5/2020,"A lot of options for breakfast sandwiches which was great because the hotel didn't offer breakfast. Â Quick and easy to order off Yelp via Grub Hub. Â 

Maybe I'm picky about my breakfast sandwiches because it's usually what I order when I head to diners/greasy spoons - plus, I cook at home - but our sandwiches were greasy. Â It'll hit the spot if you are hungover like I was (ha!) but might be too much if you're prone to heartburn which my husband was. Â 

Got the grilled crack and the breakfast burger. Â Definitely add something fresh and acidity (tomatoes, pickles, etc.) to cut the grease and all the meats/cheeses. Â 

High scores for convenience (online order for pick-up) and location. Â Though, the sandwiches might not be everyone's cup of tea."
59,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/25/2022,I have eaten there for 3 mornings in a row. Sooooooo good. Friendly service. Cutest neighborhood ever!
60,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,12/18/2021,Pretty good classic fried egg with cheese and sausage muffin. Â The muffin is homemade and fresh.
61,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,9/7/2020,"I had heard great things about this spot. Amazingly, good breakfast sandwiches are hard to find ... even in cities. We were staying at The Fairmont Copley Plaza where the restaurant charged between $23-$28 for a simple breakfast item, like oatmeat, so we decided to venture out.

We called first to see about placing an order or if they were even open on a holiday. Nobody picked up the phone and there was no recorded message. Either they were incredibly busy, or closed. Neither being ideal as it was a 20 minute walk from The Fairmont. We went on their website and discovered an online order form. All I was craving was a breakfast burrito but sadly it showed up as 'out of stock'. It was a few sandwiches to choose from ... maybe because it was 10:30 a.m. on a Sunday.

I got ""the baller"" which comes on a homemade English muffin and the lady got ""the fancy"". Both were $9. When we got the bag, we remarked how small it looked for $20. We realize its a city ... but $20 for essentially 2 egg McMuffin-sized sandwiches with no sides was a bit disconcerting. When I unwrapped my hockey puck sized sandwich and it looked like a giant caterpillar stepped on between two English muffins ... I thought we made an epic mistake.

I am pleased to say that it was, in fact, one of the best tasting breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. Salty, cheesy, gooey ... everything a breakfast sandwich shoukd be. I'm not a huge eater portion-wise but I felt that I could have easily eaten 2 of these. One was just not incredibly filling ... although, as mentioned, the taste was fantastic. I don't know if it was the 'acorn-fed bacon' or the 'heirloom antique cheddar' or the 'local free range farm eggs' ... the dense salty homemade English muffin also probably had something to do with it. If it was 2 for $12 or something ... I'd have doubled up. But I couldn't bring myself to take down 2 of these on my own for $20 with tax. A McDonalds-sized hashbrown pattie would certainly have been a perfect accompaniment and made things a little more filling.

""The fancy"" was a bit bigger having 2 eggs vs. 1 and mayo and guacamole. The girl also liked the taste of everything but said the multigrain bread was too thick/big which took a bit away from the rest of the ingredients. She didn't love the taste of her sandwich the way I did but admitted to being a bit more full than I was after eating it. I don't know how they are regarding substitutions but next time, she mentioned an English muffin would have tickled her taste buds more than the bread.

If you get a sandwich here ... the melty cheese will be the star of the show. It's kind of the signature piece di resistance. Everything was cooked well and nothing was burned or raw ... if you like your yolk runny on your sandwich, you aren't going to find it here. The eggs are more well done and spongy with a firm yellow center ... at least ours were.

Summary ... quality ingredients, solid taste, a bit on the small-side. If you are a big eater, double up. The line was long and a bit confusing of a mele in the shop and on the sidewalk. It was almost actually more confusing to pick up an online order as you have to fight through a crowd who don't like feeling like you are cutting the line. Add pandemic into the equation. They do Grubhub though ... which might be our next move should we order again. If you are looking for quality and taste and are willing to pay a bit more for it, you will enjoy it here. The line outside the door echoes the popularity of this spot."
62,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/15/2021,"Mike & Patty's has the best breakfast sandwiches in Boston! There are so many options but one of my favorites is the Breakfast Grilled Crack with bacon, cheese, and a fried egg on Iggy's Sourdough. The Fancy is also just as good, the only difference is that it has avocado and onion!!

They've recently added a new option called the Sugar Daddy Burger which features double burger patties on a Kane's Donuts glazed donut. It is the best sweet and savory ""guilty pleasure"" type combo. It's only available on weekends so give it a try.

The store itself is very small, so make sure to order ahead for pick up."
63,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,7/25/2020,"The Breakfast Grilled Crack Sandwich is a Wicked Revolutionary!

My hotel closed their entire breakfast section? What's a nice southern gent to do? (Southern being south Brooklyn) Go to Mike & Patty's for breakfast!

I walked over, just a few blocks away to grab a B.E.C sandwich (A Bacon-Egg-Cheese) and head back to my hotel before hitting the road. Mike & Patty's isn't a large establishment, its a corner store in the middle of a residential neighborhood. There are at most, three stools to sit and enjoy your Mike & Patty's creation.

I'm reading the menu and The Breakfast Grilled Crack Sandwich is speaking to me. Let's start with the outlandish, there are 4 cheeses on this breakfast sandwich! American, cheddar, swiss and gruyere gets the party started. Then add some quality bacon, fried egg and all of this goodness is adorned by toasted buttered bread from Iggy's bakery. 

The sandwich is insane. The guys at Mike & Patty's made a homerun out of Fenway with this breakfast combination. Great job guys!

If your close to the area, consider a breakfast or lunch sandwich from Mike & Patty's. It's the best Boston has to offer."
64,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,9/26/2021,A delicious and quick spot for sandwiches in Boston. I love that you can smell them masking everything all the way down the street!
65,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,1/2/2022,"A good lean operation in a spot that would never get zoned today. Â Great to find and see a unique location working well. Great food, quick service in an interesting part of town. It's a take out location."
66,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,2/6/2022,"This is literally a hole in the wall place. It's in the middle of a neighborhood on a corner with one way streets. It's tiny, only two people can be indoors at a time and their menu is small. We ordered the baller sandwich and the breakfast grilled crack. We took our order to go as there isn't a place to sit and eat. They didn't take long to make our order, but I'd recommend calling ahead and placing your order for pick up. The baller sandwich was a fluffy English muffin and absolutely delicious, definitely my favorite out of the two."
67,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,10/25/2021,Delicious breakfast sandwiches and coffee! The house made Mayo makes the sandwich. I like how they have almond milk available to put in your coffee too. All the staff were so so kind! It put me in a great mood.
68,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,9/16/2021,"Can you crave a sandwich when the word ""Boston"" is mentioned in a sentence? Yes, if we're talking Mike & Patty's - the only place you'll pay $30+ for two sandwiches and a coffee and keep coming for roughly 10 years.

I love finding this place in Bay Village near my then boyfriend now husband's old apartment that used to crush his soul but from which he would emerge to devour a Mike & Patty's egg sandwich with avacado and bacon.

Not sure if the coffee refills are still free but we used to really appreciate that when we were insanely broke but showed up for a nutritional sandwich every now and again.

Great place that shows how unaffordable but tasty Boston is."

- staff was nice. You can order online or at the counter
- you can't sit down inside; it's just a counter to order

Just a wonderfully elevated twist that's definitely not needlessly posh. They have the right amount of class. The food is simply delicious and equally as visually pleasing.
The atmosphere is nothing short of beautiful. The Grilled Crack and Robbie were so good and really delicious.
The staff is friendly, personable, and helpful. Our server was better than most I've had and it was their first-day serving!
I will definitely be returning and look forward to it."
75,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,3/18/2022,Delicious! Worth the hype. Definitely take the time to try them out. We really loved their breakfast sandwiches
76,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,9/4/2021,Random walk by and saw a line stretched around the corner. It's obvious why! They are slinging only the freshest locally sourced ingredients and the bread is fresh & most certainly made local!

80,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,6/15/2021,"Best place to stop in wether you are from out of town or a local when in the need for a good breakfast sandwich! 100 perfect recommend! Even with a crowd waiting to place orders, food is fast and fresh!!"
81,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,11/5/2020,"Stopped by Mike and Patty's for a quick breakfast it was incredible. Parking is not idea considering it's in back bay but we were able to find a place after circling a few times. The shop itself is tiny and right now they're only allowing a few people in at a time to maintain social distancing guidelines. Food came out quick and they also have an online ordering option available.

Breakfast Grilled Crack $9
Four cheeses, an egg, and lots of bacon on a Iggy's sourdough. All the flavors come together to form the perfect breakfast sandwich for a cheese lover like me. It was truly the perfect breakfast sandwich in my opinion.

Fancy $9 
This sandwich was a little lighter than the grilled crack because of the veggies on it but, still very filling and stacked high with ingredients! The eggs were nice and runny and the mayo brought everything together. Just great. 

Overall I can tell why Mike and Patty's is one of the best breakfast joints in Boston. Ingredients are fresh and prices are pretty good for the city. I can't wait to come back when I'm craving a good ol breakfast sandwich."
82,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,1/3/2022,"ordered ahead of time and strolled right in for the perfect hang over cures. Â Delicious, fresh and well put together. Â Highly recommend the bacon, egg and gruyere on rye toast. Â Amazing"
83,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/12/2021,Highly recommend this spot. Got the Crack and the Fancy. Both delicious and I'll be going back next time I visit Boston!!
84,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/4/2020,"Found Mike and Patty's on Yelp. Quick Google search showed it was a 7min walk from my hotel. So glad I made this decision! The sandwich (the Fancy) was delicious and served quickly. I walked over to the park sat down and enjoyed (it's just a walk up spot, no dine in). 

Will definitely recommend and return next time I'm in Boston. Would like to try another sandwich as it was hard to make a decision."
85,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,12/29/2021,"My fiancÃ© and I get Mike & Patty's when we need some great comfort food! He gets the fancy and I get the crack sandwich. Both are absolutely delicious! the bacon is crispy, the cheese is melty and tasty and the bread is crisp. I wish the egg was a runnier, because it hides in the sandwich if it is not. I had to do a double take to make sure there was egg in it. the ONLY negative was the OJ - it was quite expensive and certainly didn't taste like fresh squeezed. And I went in to pick up the sandwiches and one of the workers bit my head off because I did not have a mask on. I felt really bad, I did not see the sign that we had to have one on, (I thought masks were optional in MA) Â and I certainly will the next time we go. He was quite rude about it, but then again, I must of missed the sign stating it was a requirement. Definitely go! They sandwiches are great!"

88,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,11/6/2021,"Super kind employees. It is a bit small so I would recommend ordering online and picking up your food.

89,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/20/2021,"Amazing spot by Boston common! I got the breakfast crack today and it really hit the spot. It was a well executed synthesis of our all breakfast favorites: runny egg, savory bacon, gooey cheese, crisp toast. The sandwich also looks incredibly good. I really liked that the sandwich was a reasonable size so that I was left satiated but not immobile. Â Lastly, the spot has a lot of character and they make the food fast. I highly recommend and look forward to trying their other stuff!"
0,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,4/5/2022,"DELICIOUS! The garlic chicken bowl was amazing! The grilled chicken, although pale, was not dry and had some flavor. The cucumbers and cabbage were fresh and crunchy. The crispy noodles added some texture. The tamago to me tasted a bit like mango so it had a sweet component to it to balance out the other flavors. I LOVED the creamy garlic sauce--it was both creamy and garlicky which made everything come together nicely with so many different flavors. I think the best decision was getting half spring greens and half rice as my base. I often find that bowls will have too much rice which throws off the ratios and I'm stuck eating just rice at the end but this was perfect. 

Also, the chopsticks here are legit, super good quality. They're almost as sturdy as drum sticks!"
1,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,3/16/2022,"I got take out of the poke here since I was craving poke so much! The poke here is definitely bombbb! You can mix and match but I got the Fenway bowl. The sauce brings it altogether, although I wish the size of the bowl were bigger. 

However, I got a takeout order on Yelp, and didn't receive soy sauce packets nor utensils or napkins."
2,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,11/27/2021,"I used to love Love Art Sushi - the food was great and they always pack the bowl with all the good stuff. The staff was friendly and very helpful during my past visits. I'm surprised I've never reviewed this place before but it was definitely a 5 star for me. 

However during my last visit, I was met with staff that didn't seem like they wanted to be there and my Fenway bowl was a little over half filled up which was a disappointment. It just didn't feel the same anymore. We went earlier this year and things were fine but I guess I went on a bad night this time around? I bumped it down a star from my recent experience but hope this was just a one time thing!"
3,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,4/8/2022,This place was great! The fish is very fresh and everything tasted good but the one thing I didn't like was the rice. It was kind of cold and tasteless. I still highly recommend this place though!
4,Love Art Sushi,2 star rating,3/16/2022,"Did a Build Your Own. Added Shoyu Tuna, Salmon, and Kani. The proteins were fresh . The white rice was cold, hard and lumpy. They were also very stingy when it came to the proteins. I asked for a little more because I thought that it definitely wasn't enough protein and they said they were gonna charge. I counted there were about 6 cubes of shoyu tuna and 8 pieces of salmon, It came out to be $19 for a Bowl."
5,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,3/17/2022,"Order the build your own poke bowl with rice and 2 proteins through grub hub. I like that there is so many options in add ons and they work well together combined with each item in the bowl. I took advantage of the max options I can pick. Â Started off with sushi rice, spring greens and 2 proteins, spicy chili tuna and shoyu tuna. Â I've gotten the regular tuna before and the color is neon pink, a little thrown off by this. For the add ons, I chose shitake mushrooms, mandarin oranges, grape tomatoes, red cabbage, and daikon. Â The sauces I chose are spicy mayo, creamy garlic, and avo verde sauce. Â At the end, to top it off, I got scallions, edamame, crispy noodles, bonito flakes, and soy sauce packet and wasabi packet. Â They also have the option to torch the bowl at the end so you have that smoky flavor. I don't know anywhere else that does this but it's a nice touch and it does make a difference. So delicious, probably my favorite poke place in boston."
6,Love Art Sushi,2 star rating,9/15/2021,"Ordered a build your own bowl (which was great, it was fine) and a spicy hawaiian, which was a sad, half empty bowl. The fish + rice + veggies + toppings didn't even reach the top of the bowl. It was not worth $14+. The person who made my bowl was quite miserable, very unfriendly, and lacked basic manners. She was visibly annoyed when I asked for a second bowl. Love art sushi is usually one of my favorite spots but this time was not a good experience."
7,Love Art Sushi,2 star rating,1/20/2022,"I ordered from Love Art Sushi via UberEats. They were offering the special 2-0-2-2 New Year Bowl for BOGO free. The portion size was really small relative to poke bowls I've gotten elsewhere. I feel like they just cut the amount of fish in half. The salmon was pretty solid, but the tuna wasn't cut up in cubes like regular poke. Rather, it was a mushy consistency. The corn tasted like it could have been canned and the rice was a bit bland. The makiritto roll was also underwhelming - way too much rice relative to filling. Overall, not especially impressed."
8,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,11/11/2020,"Small poke spot a little off the main street. There are huge signs propped up though that should guide you to the shop. All servers are masked and the seating area is blocked off by huge tables, so you have to take your food to go or have it delivered. They're also collaborating with Okinawa Boba Co. (though I tried their boba before and didn't think it was particularly good). Their service is really fast. I was in and out in around 5 min, which was great. 

I got the Fenway Special ($12.75) and added masago ($1). They give plenty of each topping, giving half an avocado and lots of salmon and tuna for this dish. I personally thought the size of the bowl itself was a bit small given the price. 

In terms of drinks, they didn't have a lot of options at this location. They advertised Vietnamese coffee, which I was excited to get, but upon arrival, I realized their only drinks on tap were a taro tea, lychee cucumber and a red drink (not sure what it was)."
9,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,11/28/2021,"Changed my star rating to reflect the food solely after a manager addressed our concerns about poor customer service previously. They ended up speaking to the employees about the incident, offered to comp our meal, and assured us they would make sure that the experience isnt repeated and we were satisfied with their response. So, the food -- amazing bowls with fresh fish and our kids love the makrittos - an inexpensive way to feed kids and yourself! Four stars only because the rice was really cold and stuck together, seems like it wasn't that fresh. But the other location, near Fort Point, was better in a diff visit."

12,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/28/2020,Very smooth and timely delivery order. Boba was not spilled at all and presentation of the bowl held! At first I thought the bowl/drink were a bit on the smaller end for the price but it was very filling giving the rice base ($14 and $5 each). However it was super tasty and hit the spot! Seasoned very well! Only reason I don't come here more is cuz it breaks the bank but I miss the boba on tap from when we could go in person.
13,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,11/4/2020,"This is a cute poke bowl spot. Not too pricey at all. I usually get the Fenway special with eel sauce and spicy Mayo, I love getting my bowl torched as well. I paid about $14 for the bowl and it was packed with tuna, salmon, rice, corn, etc. it was a great amount of food. Parking is tough, there's resident parking only nearby and I don't recommend risking it because I got a pretty expensive ticket last time... the inside is nice and clean. The restaurant is taking the proper COVID precautions. There is no seating area, unfortunately but you could take your bowl to the park across the street. Overall, it was delicious and I highly recommend."
14,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,10/3/2021,"i saw ads about this place around the neighborhood and have always wanted to try their sushi bowls because they look so colorful! unfortunately, my expectations were not met when i came by today. 
-card only! they don't accept cash payments
-no place to eat inside the restaurant. however, there is a public area on the left of the restaurant with some outdoor tables set up. 
-the staff here seem quite friendly! there was no wait so they were able to make my bowl basically right away. 
-you can order for pickup/delivery through their website

10/3/21
-shoyu-ken bowl: this sushi bowl had white sushi rice, spring greens, two servings of shoyu ahi poke tuna, seaweed salad, edamame, scallions, nori furikake, and no sauce. the worker was kind enough to let me add pickled ginger on top and some eel sauce on the side for no extra charge. while i understand that sushi rice is not supposed to be temperature hot, i think that the coldness from the rice really threw me off. the sushi rice also didn't have enough of a vinegar flavor, and tasted quite plain. the veggies all seemed to be quite fresh, which i appreciated. however, they pretty much loaded up my bowl with veggies and not much fish. the tuna is supposedly marinated in a shoyu sauce. while it did seem to be fresh, it was still kind of lacking flavor. the eel sauce is really salty and savory, so i'm glad that i got it on the side. i also thought that they added too many scallions, which ended up overpowering everything else inside the bowl. my total came to $13.59 including tax, which is honestly quite expensive considering the fact that the bowl wasn't that filling. i probably should've added more to it, but then the price just would've been higher. (3/5)
 
overall, i appreciate the effort they put into making the sushi bowls' appearance. however, the taste could definitely be improved. i wouldn't consider this place necessarily affordable either, since their bowls are quite small too. i would recommend that you customize your bowl the way you want, so you know exactly what's inside."

How the hell does a sushi/poke bowl place run out of rice? Fine, no big deal. I order online ahead of time today for dinner. 6:40pm, my pickup time rolls around, and I show up. NO FUCKING RICE AGAIN. Just shut the whole place down, honestly. If they cannot plan to still have the one main staple, that never expires, and that you buy by the fucking 50 pound bag, they have bigger problems as an enterprise. My order in advance money has not been refunded onto my account yet, and if it does not show up soon, I will be back to give the airheads that work here hell over my $17. Out of rice my ass"
18,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,4/22/2021,"such good poke, good service, no wait

i like to fill my bowls up alll the way and they did that no problem

i got almost everything there was offered and my proteins were 2 salmon and 1 rainbow salmon (flame seared) - such a good combo and good portions

the must have is the crispy noodles - it adds the crunch you desperately need 

make sure to get all the furikake seasonings because when i only got one, it wasn't as good 

also more must haves: kale, radish, edamame, corn

i got the avoverde sauce one time and the next time i mixed avoverde and gochujang (not a good choice do not do that) but the avoverde by itself was 10/10

the second time i went was slightly less enjoyable due to some hearing problems but it was not bad 

pictured is my first bowl - just the avoverde sauce"
19,Love Art Sushi,2 star rating,12/22/2019,"The restaurant is kept very clean with cute interior decor and plenty of seating. After hearing a lot of hype about this place I decided to try it out but was pretty disappointed. The employees were very friendly but gave off weird vibes and they didn't seem to know how to operate the assembly line system effectively.
For its price, this is the least food I've ever gotten at any poke place. You're barely given any rice. I will credit the fact that their fish is very fresh, but the scoops were also small.
They have a wide selection of sauces and you can even get your bowl torched.
They offer bottomless bubble tea drinks which is a good deal because it'll help fill you up. Their poke bowls are so small you'll likely still be hungry."
20,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,11/20/2020,"My go to order at Love Art is the Fenway special ($14), which has tuna, salmon, spicy mayo, unagi eel sauce.

We also grabbed the Fenway special and spicy Hawaiian. Staff was really friendly and helpful. The drinks were all Delicious. They came with matcha boba balls and brown sugar boba balls. My favorite definitely the ube milk. The Fenway Special was so spectacular. All the ingredients just went well together. The spicy mayo was definitely clutch on it. The spicy Hawaiian was a well balance of flavors and textures. It's a bit pricey but worth every penny for the quality. Definitely, will be back to get my poke bowl fix."
22,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/8/2021,"Yes yes yes. Get makirritos
I've only gotten delivery but I have no complaints"
23,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,5/23/2019,"So, here I was reading about what ""real"" poke was... then thinking: if what I'm eating is delicious, does it really matter?

To be fair I wanted to give four stars, but considering I am starting to crave poke from here as I write is already a good indication. Sure, considering there could have been an extra scoop of fish for the price, but Love Art Sushi makes up for it with the drinks and service!

Ordered the Fenway poke bowl (no scallions) and it was a surprising delight! The fish was of high quality as the other ingredients. Bowl was of a good size but while I managed to spread the fish around fairly well, I found myself wishing for a little more. 

No complaints regarding the sauces, and I love the option to torch the bowl afterwards, though it didn't quite caramelize everything as it should have. A little too fast, perhaps? I will note, however: for those people who don't like a lot of sauce, make sure you ask for less.

The drinks were wonderful! Excellent variety, not overly sweet, and you are free to fill your cup as long as you are in the store. Have a wonderful opportunity to try the various kinds!

The service was extremely polite, offering me the various options to help add my personal touch, such as if I wanted sauces or the torching. 

The location was clean and had ample space.

Looking forward to returning soon and trying more poke goodness!"
24,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,5/18/2020,"The poke bowls are decent but their boba is...not so good. Their house curated bowls are priced very reasonably though so Love Art makes for an A-OK lunch!

Poke: 3.5/5 Â 
Makirritos: 2.5/5
Boba/Bubble Tea: 1.5/5

I try my best to support local businesses during this time while also trying out new restaurants thus my discovery of Love Art Sushi. As an avid eater of all things poke and boba enthusiast, my goal is to try as many poke and boba places as possible. Love Art Sushi is a combination of the two so the excitement was real.

Okinawa Boba Co is the name of their limited time pop-up featuring 5 drinks: Ichigo Ruby Milk, Kinako Brown Sugar Milk, Cafe Matcha Milk, Amai Thai Milk, and Satoimo Ube Milk. The drinks are super beautiful and the aesthetics are on point for the most part. Warning: they don't have real boba AKA tapioca pearls, they use crystal boba which is not as great. The drinks definitely left me yearning for some chewy, sweet, tapioca pearls. All their drinks are basically a cup of whole milk with flavored syrup streaked down the side for looks. The ube was the only OK tasting one. The Thai tea was awful and tasted nothing like Thai tea to me. I appreciated that I could taste the matcha on the ""Matcha Milk"" but it seemed more like a poorly constructed matcha latte to me. The strawberry in the ""Ichigo Ruby"" was more on the tart side than sweet side so if you like your strawberry milk more tart then this is fine. The one I was most excited for was the brown sugar but it just lacked in all aspects. The brown sugar streaks on the side of the cup disappeared within a minute. I love brown sugar milk but this...wasn't it. I wanted to chalk it up to them having a bad day as it seemed like a high school kid was making my drinks. I wanted to try them so bad I bought all 5 but when 5/5 drinks are meh it's tough for me to say I'd go back for their boba. At least I got a cool picture out of it,

Their poke isn't my favorite but it's not too bad. The ingredients are fresh and the quality of the raw fish is pretty standard for poke. I opted for the Fenway Special because I felt building my own wasn't worth the value but my boyfriend opted to build his own bowl. My bowl was mostly pretty good but next time I would opt to build my own bowl so I can better control the sauces. The eel sauce kind of overpowered everything else. My boyfriend said ""I can't quite put my finger on it but I just feel like something is missing"" and that his bowl was a bit skimpy. Their kanikama or crab stick meat is a protein option when it should be a topping (it is imitation crab, afterall). Avocado is also a protein? Once again, should be a side. If they wanted to charge $1 extra for avocado being a side I wouldn't be mad but because it is considered a protein it's an extra $2. Seaweed salad and masago are an additional $1 each. This is why I opted for one of their house curated bowls. 

Their makirritos didn't present well. I expected cute mini sushi burritos but the presentation disappointed me. We opened them immediately after they were wrapped and they just looked all squished together. We came at 2pm to avoid the lunch rush but the guy making our food forgot the sauce on the side. We ordered 3 makirritos: salmon, spicy tuna, and shoyu tuna. We were wondering why they were so lacking in flavor...forgot the sauce, man. If I just had a bit of spicy mayo or yuzu aioli it probably would have changed my mind on these."
25,Love Art Sushi,1 star rating,3/1/2021,"I ordered ""Fenway Special"" and ""Spicy Hawaii "" in person in the store. The guy serving me was training the new staff during the process making my meals, which made ""Fast Food"" pretty Slow( 20 Minutes). 
What is worse is the quality of the Sushi, you can see the picture. It was bad and sour."
26,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,3/9/2020,"Hands down, the best bang for the buck poke I've had so far. Granted I had to walk a ways to get it, but it was completely worth it. I customized my bowl and the ingredients generously filled the bowl, to the point where everything was up against the lid. I've never had a portion of poke like this for the same price anywhere else, and this filled me up to over-satisfaction. The quality was spectacular too-- everything tasted so fresh.

I was so bedazzled by the food that I decided to buy a drink as well. That taro bubble tea was pretty good, on the sweeter side for my tongue. Unfortunately I didn't eat in to take advantage of the free refills, but NBD.

Truly a gem I'd return to when I'm back in the area again!"
27,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,2/1/2020,"Artsy sushi, study space, unlimited bubble tea?! So down to chill at this place!

I love that you can make your own poke bowl, but as a lazy person who loves anything in poke, I've ordered from their house curated bowls. Fenway Special and Rainbow Fish Bowls have been my personal favorites!

This place is an automatic study space for me with continuous flow of bubble tea (and also a bathroom from too much liquid). I usually could find a table to station myself at. I would recommend others for a place to eat, sip, and work!"
28,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,3/2/2019,"Love Art Sushi is a good option for a quick and reasonably healthy meal around the Fenway/Mass Ave area. You can pick one of the preset poke bowls (the Fenway seems to be the most popular) or you get to create your own.

I would recommend to make your own as you can have as many of regular/non-premium toppings as you like - my favorites are the shiitake mushroom, edamame, mandarin oranges, and nori (seaweed) flakes. For protein, I like their Salmon and Tuna, but thought the Unagi (Eel) tasted a little bit weird... I tend to avoid the Spicy Tuna and the Rainbow Salmon as I think the sauces mixed in with the fish can be overpowering, but they are popular choices among customers.

They offer a few different flavored milk tea and fruity tea available and you get free refills as long as you are in the restaurant! Definitely a bonus!"
29,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,6/1/2021,Great food and decently fast service for a busy and popular restaurant. Good food especially the mini Japanese burritos.
30,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,5/15/2019,"Today was my first time at Love Art Sushi. The poke spots I've been to in the past have been hit-or-miss so LAS was a pleasant surprise! They offer bowls (curated or build-your-own), ""Makirittos"", desserts, bottomless bubble tea and more! 

I ordered the California Dreamin' and my brother got the Fenway Special. Â Each one came out to be around $13. While that's on the pricey side, I think it's justified. The fish and crab tasted high quality and the rice, toppings, and sauces were delicious. It was clear to me that each ingredient was prepared with care. I loved that they seared our bowls at the end with a blowtorch - an unexpected touch that brought the food to the next level. 

My only complaint is that the bottomless bubble tea is lacking variety. Plus, every time you go back for more, you have to repay for any toppings (bubbles, jelly, etc), which sort of defeats the purpose of having a ""bottomless"" offering. I would love to see a classic milk tea as an option, but that's just me."
31,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,9/8/2021,First time visiting Boston and this place just happened to be right where I parked my car. I love sushi so I have it a try. Employees were very nice and had Great energy even while having to make a huge order on Labor Day (not my order but I overheard them discussing it) Can't find makirittos back home so we'll definitely be back here! Perfect spot for lunch!
32,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,11/7/2018,"Love their pokÃ© bowls. 

So, you order at the counter. They have a variety of rolls and bowls (hey, that rhymes). Either you can pick one of their combos or build your own. I always get a build your own bowl because then I can choose all the toppings I want! 

I typically get rice as the base, lots of veggies (beets, carrots, bean sprouts, corn, tomatoes, etc.) The beets and carrots are pickled. I also add mandarins, because you get a burst of flavor whenever your bite contains one. Then two scoops of protein - their one scoop seems a little small. Either plain salmon or rainbow salmon which is just their marinated salmon (soy flavor with a few veggies). I've also tried their tofu, surprisingly tasty. Then you choose a sauce - I like the ponzu and the spicy mayo. You can get your bowl torched, if you like (so cool). And then come the toppings - edamame, crunchy noodles, etc. I also get their tasty seaweed salad which costs extra.

They also have bottomless drinks. The Vietnamese coffee is the best. I like their taro milk tea but they make it with a powder and if you wait a while to drink it, it separates. I usually bring my own mug. But the staff always gets confused if that's allowed. I mean it's bottomless drinks, so why not!

All in all, it's a great place to get a pokÃ© bowl. A few reviews have spoken about service being slow, but I personally have gotten fast and efficient service (in the evenings).

Other stuff - parking is tough to get in the area. There is street parking on Mass Ave but you might have to look for a while to get a spot. They have a few books and games in the store to keep you entertained. There's usually some nice artwork on the walls for sale."
33,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,2/27/2021,"It was mostly good. Three stars because they carelessly put together my order. I ordered a build your own bowl delivery for delivery. There were four items missing, including the ponzu, which was a huge bummer, and one extra item that I didn't order. The salmon, however, seemed fresh and they were generous with the other toppings. I always order tofu in my poke bowls too but this was the weirdest tofu I have ever seen. It was brown and slimy. It was also in long strips and not cubes like I expected. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be crispy and it sat too long but it was inedible. Definitely stay away from the tofu! I'll give them another try, they have potential."
34,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,11/12/2018,"It's definitely hard to find good poke in Boston and with going to Pokeworks and having a good experience there, I wanted to try Love Art Sushi.

Located on Mass Ave across the street from Berkeley School of Music, this counter service restaurant allows you to choose a bowl or a makiritto (sushi burrito). There are a selection of 12 or so items of bowls and burritos each, ranging from $9-13 (the burritos are around $9 with bowls ranging from 10-13 depending on the protein you decide to add. 

I ordered the Fenway Special which included: White Sushi Rice, Spring Greens, Corn Kernels, Avocado, Tuna, Salmon, Spicy Mayo, Unagi Sauce, Scallions, Katsuo Furikake (ingredients from their website). What's unique is that you can customize what you want as well as have the option to get it flame seared at the very end.

Overall love Art sushi didn't disappoint and I was satisfied with their food. However, I do have to say that Pokeworks gave more food and was a little cheaper than Love Art Sushi. I wouldn't mind coming back here but I would definitely try something else like their Makiburrito."
35,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,9/1/2019,"I've had Love Art Sushi bookmarked for longer than I can say, but finally got the chance to visit on a whim last Friday when I was in town for the Unofficial Yelp Event for Dine Out Boston at Davio's. Knowing I was in for an evening of good food and good times, I wanted something a bit lighter for lunch, and Love Art came through just in time! 

Tucked just steps away from the modern campus of Berklee College of Music, Love Art is a hipster enclave dedicated to Japanese-inspired poke bowls, ""Makirritos"" (a tongue in cheek riff on a burrito, with sushi ingredients instead of tortillas and beans), and bubble teas. The space is clean and well lit, with millennial friendly details like a quirky neon sign, funky avocado and sushi pillows, and plenty of seating for gossiping with pals or getting work done. I could absolutely see myself hunkering down to spend a couple hours here, and I plan to in the future! It's quite inviting, AND best of all, the tea fountain drinks have free refills! Amazing.

As for the food, Love Art follows the common fast-casual setup where customers walk down the counter and create their own bowls from a multitude of fillings, or place their order for a few house-made creations. I went with the create your own bowl, which comes in two sizes: a regular, and a mini snack one. The regular size was a filling serving for my lunch and I was quite happy with the portions. Each bowl starts with a base of sushi rice, and then you can pile on your choice of greens, veggies, raw fish, chicken, and more. I would have loved to see a bigger serving size for the sushi fish, as it was small, but I got a few different kinds to try. The spicy tuna was my favorite - I'll probably just go with a few scoops of that next time. My favorite part was the dipping sauces, though. I tried the Spicy Mayo, which was good but nothing to write home about. However, the Yuzu sauce was INCREDIBLE, and probably one of the best things I've had all year. The creamy lemony sauce was awesome on top of the sticky sushi rice, and I could not get enough! I'd go back for that sauce alone. Seriously, it's the must-get.

The Yelp Check In offer is so generous and not to be missed! For $5, you get a choice of a ""Makirrito"" and a fountain drink. We got the California Makirrito, which was basically an oversized California roll. It was yummy - I might try a more adventurous preparation next time, but I got it for my boyfriend, who isn't a sushi eater. I also LOVED the tea fountain, especially the sweet Taro Tea and the flavorful Passionfruit Tea. Add bubbles for an extra upcharge, which is totally worth it. A side note: none of the teas are unsweetened :( I was doing a #TreatYoSelf day, but normally I couldn't have the sweet teas, so if anyone from Love Art is reading this, it would be amazing if you could offer an unsweetened option or two! :)

Anywhoooo, Love Art is awesome, I can't recommend it more, and I am stoked to be back soon! #TeamYuzu"
36,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,1/14/2020,"I used to come here all the time when I worked at the Prudential. This location was never terribly busy (and I mean that in a good way). It was busy enough to know it's popular, but not busy to the point where the line is out the door and it takes forever to place your order. 

I found the portions to be pretty generous and the pricing is reasonable. The fish is fresh and the variety of toppings/sauces allows you to customize your bowl as much as you'd like. 

For protein, I loooove the poke options and the spicy tuna or even just the salmon. The sauces are all pretty solid - I'll change them up depending on the protein I get, but some top choices are the spicy mayo, ponzu, eel, and the avoverde. 

I'd highly recommend this place if you want a lunch or dinner option that is filling, but won't leave you feeling sluggish or sleepy."
37,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/24/2021,"We got the sushi burritos (makrittos) - in salmon, tuna, avocado. They come with sauce options on the side so you can get garlic sauce, spicy mayo, eel/unagi sauce. portion sizes are maybe around 2 to 3 bites so definitely would recommend ordering 2 per person as a good rule of thumb. We ordered for picked up and walked around the city while devouring them"
38,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/31/2021,Never disappoints!! Love this place. Particularly the rainbow salmon is amazing and full of flavor. Carrots are delicious. Always get your bowl flamed (best part)!
39,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,9/17/2018,"Came here at the suggestion of one of my friends, and I'm so glad I did! Great poke stop with fresh fish and great presentation. The concept is same as other poke restaurants you're probably used to -- chipotle style with fish as protein. 

The food: I ordered the build your own bowl with three proteins - rainbow salmon, shoyu ahi, and kimchi tuna. You can choose 2, 3, or 4 proteins. The rainbow salmon was mixed with corn and other veggies, pretty tasty. I personally didn't like the kimchi tuna because the spice personally didn't work well in the bowl for me with the other ingredients. But maybe if you're a kimchi fanatic, you might love it.

I appreciated the standard toppings were unlimited. Premium toppings were things like avovado and seaweed salad which was understandable. 

The presentation was fantastic. You have the option of doing a top sear with a blow torch. I'm not sure if it affected the taste, but was certainly a cool show. Then drizzle it with different sauces, sprinkles of sesame seed mix, add crunch with crispy noodles. 

The space: Medium size, some seatings that are bar stools along the wall or regular tables. Bright with nice decorations. 

The staff: Very friendly and patient, which I appreciate since it was my first time 

This place was pretty popular at lunchtime. Worth a visit if you're into poke!"
40,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,6/12/2019,"This place is a little hidden poke gem! It's tucked around the corner on Mass Ave and hence, is never too crowded. I've come here multiple times and the quality of the fish is always incredibly fresh, there is consistency (an underrated but imperative trait in these fast-casual places), friendly staff, and generous portions. They have pre-curated bowls or DIY--I always go with the latter but if you're someone who already suffers with decision fatigue, it's nice to have the other option. 

They have multiple protein options, lots of veggies (of which you can get unlimited, I loathe it a little bit when they limit you to only 5 or some other arbitrary number. ALL THE TOPPINGS!!!!). It's also good to note that seaweed salad and avocado are $1 extra, but I think this is standard practice now across the fast-casual-board. Lots of sauce choices--spicy mayo is my go-to. 

They offer cute and delicious drinks, with the options of boba/jelly in them; my favorite is the taro drink--yum! There's a decent amount of seating, I've never had an issue getting a table."
41,Love Art Sushi,1 star rating,4/9/2021,"Ordered 2 Â ""create your own bowls"" in person and they barely filled the bowl half way. Very disappointed."
42,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,2/27/2021,"This is the ONLY poke place in the Boston area that doesn't skimp on the fish. Really well balanced bowls, delicious sauces and great options for toppings. I love making my own and they always do a good job putting it together, not sloppy like some other places-- definitely recommend!!"
43,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,7/26/2020,"my friend and I weren't a big fan Spicy Hawaiian(the one in the back) but we both loved Fenway Special! I have actually never seen anyone who didn't like Fenway Special unless they didn't eat sashimi in general haha. It's definitely my go-to meal at Love Art Sushi! However, it's not really filling, to be honest."
44,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,5/26/2018,"Free miso soup when check-in on yelp!

I had regular bowl with rice, eel, kimchi tuna, seaweed(extra$) and other free toppings. I liked the eel but was not impressed by the combination of kimchi and tuna. Toppings were all fresh, Interior was spacious, bright and clean. Price is reasonable. Good lunch spot!"
45,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,10/28/2019,"Fish is really fresh and they have a lot of options for BYO or premade bowls! 

I came in on a Monday night around 7pm and the place wasn't packed at all but they were backed up with Uber eats orders. There was about 6 people behind the tiny counter and they were all running into each other trying to complete orders that it clearly looked like there was no system going on. A person behind me in line even got their bowl before I did because of how unorganized they were in managing online vs in person orders. 

I got a BYO with greens and rice, cucumber, ginger, edamame, cabbage, seaweed salad, imitation crab, and two scoops of salmon with the ponzu and spicy mayo dressing. It looked like they didn't put much protein while they were scooping, but as I was eating I found that they actually gave a lot of protein! 

They also give bottomless bubble tea for $3 which is a pretty good deal. 

Overall, decent poke bowl but just wish service was a little more efficient."
46,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,5/31/2018,"Love Art Sushi is the closest poke bowl option near my apt so I've been going there a lot. The first couple of times I went with the fenway special. It's a good combo and comes with avocado! It's a little heavy on the sauce but overall it came together nicely. The fish scoops are pretty small in comparison to how much I usually get at poke works or yoki express. Also, masago is extra :(. 

Now I've started creating my own bowl and it's definitely too small to fill me up. It's too bad because they use fresh ingredients and I like their speciality bowls. Also, I tried the spicy tuna and it was basically fish mush. Maybe I was thinking of the tossed tuna chunks with spicy sauce at another place but it was NOT what I was expecting. I will never get it again. 

I guess I'll be trekking to the other poke spots so I can get some more fish!"
47,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,7/17/2018,"I really like the layout of this place. Most pokÃ© places have you start in the back, work your way to the front, and pay but not here! Instead of having to push through the restaurant, you can start ordering right where you enter. You can choose from one of their bowls or make your own. I decided to try the Spicy Hawaiian and my friend made her own. (she saved money so I'll consider making my own next time) 

For what the restaurant is, they have a good amount of seating areas. The food is pretty good and fresh. They have boba but I didn't get any. The atmosphere is pretty dope and overall pretty clean. 

Parking does kinda suck because of its location but a little walking in Back Bay doesn't hurt!"
48,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,6/20/2018,"I really enjoyed my Love Art Sushi experience. It is a short walk away from the Hynes T in a somewhat hidden street
I had a ""build your own"" poke bowl with two protein servings (poke and salmon and I Â was surprised by the many toppings available. And the fact that you can add as many as you want!! I added mushrooms, edamame, cucumber, nori, rice crisps, mandarin orange and Spicy mayo (full disclosure, some toppings like avocado cost extra) . 

My favorite part was the BOTTOMLESS Â bubble tea. Get one big serving of bubbles or jelly and then just refill your cup with any delicious flavor as many time as you want! I tried the mango star jelly with mango tea and the strawberry citron. Both were very good . I had a sample of the Vietnamese coffee tea and it was really good 

Can't wait to go back.

Update: so , I came back and got only one protein portion and it was tiny !! What happened??"
49,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,8/17/2018,"The food was bomb and the staff was so patient and helpful! Good experience, good food, good price point. Including the drink (free refills) I paid $13.50 total. You can order their special bowls or customize your own, and you can add miso soup. The menu can be kind of overwhelming at first, but you get the hang of it pretty quickly, and you order at the front of the store and then go in to sit down (unless you're taking it to go).

I ordered the 2-protein regular bowl and got: tuna, salmon, rice and spring mix base, bean sprouts, corn, cucumber, edamame, grape tomatoes, mandarin oranges, shiitake mushrooms, spicy mayo, unagi sauce. Almost all the toppings can be included in your customizations although some (e.g. avocado) are extra. I asked for it flame-broiled and topped it with sesame seeds and nori rice. Also your drink options are so good. You can opt to add bubbles but the drinks by themselves are refreshing and delicious. Writing this is making me crave it again. Full stars would go again"
50,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,2/28/2018,"I've been determined to try every Poke place in Boston and Greater Boston Areas. When I found out about this place, I finally made my way over there. It's definitely a bit tucked away, but it has a very cool decor / atmosphere. How to order is a bit confusing, especially if you don't know or never experienced ordering Poke before. All the staff was friendly and the gent who was doing the toppings was kind enough to let me know which Toppings were $1 extra.

I am very use to one price for a bowl, but here they do the bowl with the base as one charge (around $6 or so for a regular), then each scoop of protein (which are tiny scoops full) at a bit less than $2 each, then SOME of the toppings are up charges at $1 more like Masago and Seaweed Salad. I do secretly wish they had Crab Salad and Onions as ""toppings"". 

As I try the last two places I know about in the area, this place didn't impress me or disappoint me. They had different flavors of Protein which I found surprising and impressive. Their Shoyo Ahi was very spot on to Hawaiian's shoyo ahi (which I've had multiple times too). 

The sushi rice was a bit too sticky and made it a bit harder to eat in the recyclable ""paper"" bowl - Masago stuck all over the sides too. 

I'll come back here if I'm ever in the area again, but it was definitely an interesting experience."
51,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,8/16/2020,New favorite poke in Boston! My order came very quickly and the fish was fresh and cold. The portions were huge and the sauces were so good. I'll definitely be ordering again!
52,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/31/2019,"I used to be skeptical about poke because I thought it was just deconstructed sushi and obviously a fad. This place changed my mind and now I'm a poke addict. 

Their bowls are full of fresh, juicy cuts of fish. Their greens are crisp, clean and fresh. Their avocado doesn't have brown spots and is just the right ripeness. Everything is full of flavor, and there's a great variety of ingredients you can choose for your bowl. 

The place is clean and bright, and the staff are friendly. It's worth the cost!"
53,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,3/20/2019,"I was really excited to try Love Art Sushi - poke bowls have been a favorite of mine lately, and LAS didn't disappoint! I appreciated the amount of options I was able to choose from and the ability to further customize the pre-made bowls. 

I tried the Fenway bowl and it was really tasty, I just wish it was bigger for the price. Same with the makirito and bubble tea. Overall everything tasted good, but this is not a place I can frequent or I'll burn a hole in my wallet!

I ordered delivery so I wasn't able to take part in the 'bottomless bubble tea' that I've heard others rave about, but that's definitely an incentive to go to the location in person in the future.

Overall I did really like everything I got at LAS, and I would love to visit the actual store in person in the future, maybe after my next payday :)"
54,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,1/22/2019,If you love poke bowls... Then you need to come here for a quick bite of heaven. Ordered the Hawaiian and the Fenway. All the poke looked and tasted fresh and having the option to flame sear the sushi was a great perk (haven't seen that anywhere else in LA). The servers really were friendly and informative on how to make it taste so good. Definitely a must when in the area yearning for sushi!
55,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,11/24/2017,"I wanna like this place... but it just wasn't very good poke. My girlfriend and I came here for a stop while we were shopping. We selected a pre-made bowl of the Spicy Hawaiian. 

As much as I love the vibe of the store, the food itself was not on point. The rice was not very well prepared. It wasn't good quality rice. The fish itself was also very average and meh. I didn't think it was very well flavored or marinated. I don't like to think of myself as a picky eater and I don't like to bash on places, but the food here was very average. The whole bowl was close to $14 and I kind of wish we made our own bowl to eat instead.

Really cute place though."
56,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,1/27/2021,Love Art Sushi is simply great. The spot is very chic & clean. These guys got a spectacular menu too. The service is good from a welcoming staff. I wish I could give Love Art Sushi more stars.
57,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/10/2017,"Love this place! We purchased and used a Groupon on our first visit. 

As vegetarians, the toppings are limited to tofu and avocado. We did custom bowls with both salad and rice. By the end of the line, our bowls were filled. The only thing I wasn't super excited about were the sauces - especially the mayonnaise based ones. The drinks are sugary and I had to dilute it with water. The jelly for the drinks were good.

Overall food was good, service was excellent, and the place was clean. We would definitely come back!"
58,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,6/20/2017,"Boston is always a little behind on the food trends. It is hard to keep up with LA and NYC! But finally we have a poke place the city! I haven't tried PokÃ©
City in Cambridge so I don't have that to compare. But comparing to other poke places that I have tried, this is pretty awesome!

They have a build your own option. You start with the base with either sushi rice or mixed greens. Then you can add mix ins from kale to edamame beans to grape tomatoes. For proteins, you can add Â Grilled Chicken, Kanikama, Inari, Salmon, Spicy Tuna, Tuna, Kimchi Tuna Poke, Shoyu Ahi Poke, Rainbow Salmon Poke. They charge $1.88 for each raw fish option. Then you have a choice of delicious sauces and toppings that you can add for finishing touches. Then voila! You have yourself a poke bowl. If you are indecisive like me, you can order the preset ones. I ordered the Spicy Hawaiian Poke. It was super delicious! I like the shoyu ahi poke. I swapped the jalapeÃ±os for pickled ginger. The rice to fish proportion was on point. The fish was fresh. The flavors were delicious. I would definitely come back a try other bowls. There is something for everyone here, even non sashimi lovers. 

Don't forget to check into Yelp for the bottomless boba drinks! They are not like the ones I usually get at a boba shop but this is an awesome deal!"
59,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,7/8/2017,"A little late to the game; but they caught up finally! Poke has been all over NYC but happy to see a good one pop up in Beantown. Two sizes: snack (tiny little bowl) or regular (more meal size). You can build your own or you can select from their list. I was lazy and went with the Fenway special which has a rice base with some greens (think salad); corn and then salmon and tuna topped with spicy mayo. You can have a option for them to scorch your fish (which I did); adds a nice light crisp to it. They also have a option to by a bottomless tea options; for $3.06 you can have a all you can drink tea (the bubble tea is $0.50 and that isn't limitless) but for the drinks, you can drink your way through all their flavors ranging from taro, white peach, to lychee. Â 

Overall great portions and flavors and good quality fish. I would come back :)"
60,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,8/26/2017,"Pros:
-No line at 1pm on a Saturday! 
-Fair amount of seating. 

Cons:
-Pricey for portion size
--
Fenway Special ($12.25)
One of their most popular items. Very beautiful and pretty tasty. Sushi rice is great, but the portions of fish are fairly small. Overall, it seemed pretty expensive for the amount of food you get. I'd come back, but will definitely opt to make my own bowl with one type of fish to cut down the cost to around $8-9."
61,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,2/22/2017,"I'm not a fan of those create-your-own style food spots but when I saw the special menu with their own creations, I can dig it. The place is definitely trendy and cute. There are more seats in the back if all the high tops in front are taken. And each ingredient are neatly displayed and some was in their own separate little container, like raw fish, to keep them fresh and probably for portion controls. Smart!

Fenway Special ($11+)- Well, here's the thing... they didn't have any of the ingredients to make this, so I ended up customizing the bowl which was a little disappointing. I ended up choosing arugula, corn, tuna, sesame seeds with spicy mayo and unagi sauce on top of white rice. The half avocado would have made a huge difference in this bowl but they ran out, so they replaced it with unagi for me to compensate for the price. But hey, it's still a tasty sushi bowl. 
Crispy Noodle Nacho Hack- A bunch of crispy noodles in a bowl topped with spicy tuna, scallions, avocado, drizzled with unagi sauce and spicy mayo! So good. 

Overall Service: After picking what was available to put in my bowl, I decided to just dine there since there was space in front. As I'm sitting there, I overheard someone asking for avocado and they checked out back for to see if someone was preparing them. I thought that was a little odd seeing the answer they gave me was ""we're all out of those"". Oh boy. After eating as much as I can, I wanted to pack the rest for home and went up to the counter to ask for a lid. The gentleman who grabbed it for me was very personable and even asked me if I wanted to add anything else to the bowl, which was super sweet. Too bad I was too full at the time. I will be back to try their other creations!"
62,Love Art Sushi,2 star rating,2/11/2017,"All the new poke shops in Boston opening as of late are all the way in Cambridge (aka not close to me), so I was beyond excited when I heard about Love Art Sushi and came to check it out during it's soft opening week.

The good: 
- Lots of choices for veggies sides, unlimited even. So you can pile that bowl extra high. 
- They also have several varieties of toppings of fish.

The bad: 
- Service was incredibly slow. There was only 1 guy doing the toppings and the line was getting 10 people deep.
- I can't stand the fact that the toppings come in these little plastic dishes. It looks super cheap that they're pre-proportioned. It doesn't feel as fresh either. Oh and it's obviously not environmentally friendly. They can just train their employees to scoop the right amount of poke, like every other place...
- The poke tasted good but the servings are tiny tiny. With the regular bowl, I got the max of 4 different ones and it wasn't much at all. Why is there even a max to begin with? If you're hungry, there's Wendy's down the street..."
63,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,6/18/2017,"Sushi is arguably my favorite food. I'm always in the mood for it especially in the summer. Case in point, I got a sushi bowl for breakfast today. Granted, it was 1p by the time I got my food but it was still my first meal of the day. At the risk of sounding like a lazy POS, I used UberEATS to have the food delivered to my door so I cannot comment on the service or location. My food did arrive within 10 mins of the estimated time which I thought was super impressive.

Onto more important matters, the food itself. I ordered the two protein rice bowl with rainbow salmon poke, tuna, and a bunch of toppings. Being the big eater that I am, I also added the kimchi tuna makiritto to my cart. I am giving props to Love Art Sushi for not missing any of the gazillion toppings I had added to my bowl but I am knocking off a star because the quality is about the same as Whole Food's premade sushi. But bowls will run you around $10-15 and you get a lot more food than ordering just a sushi roll so I can't really complain."
64,Love Art Sushi,1 star rating,6/1/2021,Not sure what this supposed to be. Crappy frozen fish on overcooked rice. The can of coke was hot? My wife got so sick. The menu has nothing new or overly exciting... it's a cheap poke brand. Terrible
65,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,1/27/2017,"Another sushi / poke bowl place has opened up in Boston, and in my quest to find the perfect place (still haven't found it in the east coast yet folks), I had to try Love Art Sushi out.

I looked at the menu online prior to coming here and was very excited to see the unlimited veggie / fruit mix ins as well as a large selection of proteins. Lots of poke places here just have the super basics: salmon, tuna, shrimp and tofu, so I was thrilled that they serve spicy tuna and hamachi here. Other interesting items include spam and already marinated fish (poke).

You pay a flat fee to get a base plus veggies and any protein (or expensive veggie like seaweed salad and avocado) is an additional cost. There are some standard proteins for $1.65 and the premium ones for $1.88.

The line was long but at first I didn't think it was too bad. Since the server needs to keep adding whatever the customer orders, it may take a while.

However, as I moved along the ordering line to pick my items, I grew progressively more disappointed.

I get that's it's a soft opening so not all items are available, but the soft opening menu already had several options crossed off and when I ordered today they didn't have cucumbers, any kind of poke (except one salmon one which I am allergic to), or any hamachi. 

I was also shocked to see the proteins preportioned and stored in little to go sauce cups. They were SMALL. Seemed a little wasteful unless they reused them (but I think that's unsanitary and a health code violation for raw fish).

In the end I got two scoops of spicy tuna in my half filled bowl of white rice, corn, mushrooms and scallions. The portion was a huge bummer. I was still hungry after this. Also the other veggie toppings didn't seem like they belonged in sushi bowls: jackfruit, raisins, tomatoes...Overall my meal was lackluster, though I did add the miso dressing and really liked the flavor. Â 

Some suggestions:
- Make standard and premium toppings one price. The cashier has to stare at each bowl to decipher what kind of fish each person got and then charge based on the item. The difference between the two is ONLY 23 CENTS. If everything was maybe $1.75 that would even out the cost of the items but make the wait so much better for us.

- Get rid of the menu during this soft opening. You are getting customers' hopes up when they see the menu at the front of the line and then realize a ton of stuff isn't available.

- Get more tables and chairs! There's a generous amount of space but not enough actual furniture and I had to take my bowl to go."
66,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,3/13/2019,"It was my first time at Love Art Sushi and I did not regret it at all. I was nervous to go at first because I am a vegetarian, but you can make your own poke bowl and make it vegetarian. 
It was super good. It's a good place to hangout with your friends and have some good food at the same time. The employees there were super sweet too. Go! You won't regret it. 
Because I created my own bowl, I got rice as my base, edamame, bean sprouts, mandarin oranges, baby tomatoes, avocado, crispy noodles, and spicy mayo as my toppings."
67,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,8/3/2017,"Hey, so we almost missed this tiny place. After a long day touring Boston and Back Bay, we stumbled out of the subway and found this. Perfect end to a fun day: pokÃ© bowls of all flavors and options, and pretty reasonable for the area. The fish is fresh, the seasoning delicious. 

California Dreamin' bowl for non-sushi aficionados was nicely put together. We had three different bowls from the menu and one build-it-yourself bowl. You can't go wrong. 

Don't miss the mochi ice cream assortment. Maybe a little soft by the time we got back to the hotel room, so probably best to eat on site. Great meal. Highly recommended."
68,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,9/8/2018,"I tried this via ubereats because I was too lazy to actually make it here in person. Â I ordered a poke bowl, tuna roll, and Vietnamese coffee. Â Every item ordered was equally delicious. Â The poke bowl itself was tasty and huge portions. I could barely finish it. Â A huge plus is that they do not skimp on the salmon or tuna like other places. Â The Vietnamese coffee is one of the best I have tasted! Â Next time I will definitely visit the location because if the food is still tasty after being delivered all the way to Cambridge, I can only imagine how much better it must be if you order on site with no travel time!"
69,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,7/3/2020,Best poke bowls in Boston and the bubble tea with green tea boba is amazing! My favorite poke bowl Is the spicy one. They deliver and have take out service only at the moment.
70,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,2/1/2017,"I came here during their soft opening and was very surprised at how good it was, given that I am not a huge sushi fan. 

The location is in a random street right off mass ave across from berklee so you could easily miss it. 

The line was very long, but I imagine it was only because of the soft opening. They were also low on a lot of toppings/ran out to my disappointment. 

I ended up getting a bunch of veggies on rice, with spicy tuna, seaweed salad, and some type of salmon (not sure what he called it lol). You're allowed to choose 4 proteins/expensive veggie for free. Then at the end, you can choose which sauces to add. 

Even with the limited toppings they had when I arrived, my poke still ended up tasting amazing. They also have bubble tea!!!! 

Will definitely be coming here fairly often from now on :)"
71,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/9/2018,"In my opinion, one of the truest truths of this world is that poke (and any variation of sushi/fresh fish for that matter) is delicious. Love Art Sushi is no exception.

They offer a menu of bowls and the option to customize your own. I'm all about the customization. The bowls are on the larger side in my opinion and they don't just overfill it with rice. They give you a hardy portion of fish compared to other places. Fresh fish, the only type of fish we should ever expect. They also let you get unlimited standard toppings. They do charge for ""premium"" toppings like avocado, but in 2018, who doesn't? They have a variety of sauces to drizzle on top. I'm a bit fan of the sweet chili, but there's something to everyone's taste. To couple with that bowl, they have bottomless teas which I think is a sweet deal if you're going to sit down and hang out for a bit.

Love Art Sushi is good in terms of the Boston poke scene and for about $13, it's even better."
72,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,5/28/2017,"I ordered the shoyu-ken (whaddup Street Fighter) and added garlic sauce, which really packed a punch in terms of flavor. I also did the yelp check in for unlimited bubble tea. Totally worth it since I think unlimited bubble tea is $3? The cucumber drink was refreshing but the viet coffee was a little too sweet for my tastes.

I really loved everything about love art sushi, but I'm not sure if the fish was fresh since my stomach started to feel a little funny after eating."
73,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,4/9/2017,"Unlimited toppings!! Still in their soft opening stage, so not everything is available yet (e.g. hamachi) , but a pretty solid selection is. I like their gochujang marinated tuna - and usually I dislike tuna. One regular bowl can be quite filling because the staff make sure you know that you can have as many and as much of the toppings as you want! The sushi portions are a regular spoonful. I would recommend choosing two seafood portions, which will only come out to $10~. 

Definitely check in on Yelp for free bottomless tea! I liked their lychee cucumber tea with aloe. I think their strong point is definitely in their fruitier teas. The HK cappuccino was not for me, but they have small tasting cups so try them all first! I'm sure this place will be better known once they transition out of soft opening since they have a good number of seats as well."
74,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,7/12/2017,"Visited for the first time today and honestly ... it's love at first sight. 5/5 stars for food, service, and ambiance.

Custom regular poke bowl - 5/5
I had a half salad/half rice base with essentially all the toppings, seared kimchi ahi, and eel dressing. The quality of the ingredients were fantastic - everything was fresh. The serving size is very generous for a low price (especially since I was able to get a free protein topping for checking in on Yelp). The vegetable toppings are unlimited/free. I wanted to try all of them, and they didn't seem to mind at all. My bowl ended up being stacked very high with all sorts of toppings. I recommend torching your poke bowl - they will do it right in front of you! 

Bottomless bubble tea - 4/5
The teas are self served, and they have a wide variety to choose from. The flavor of the teas themselves are pretty good, but I personally think that they are a bit too sweet for me. The boba was interesting... it does not taste like the traditional chewy boba you usually find; it is more of a jelly/ aloe texture. I liked it though.

Ambience - 5/5 
This shop is so cute... they're got fantastic decorations. I could totally see myself spending an entire afternoon here doing work and drinking their bottomless bubble tea...

Service - 5/5
The people who prepared my poke bowl were so friendly! There was a line for the poke but it moved relatively fast. 

Would definitely recommend !! Perfect for a quick meal to go or a sit down dinner :)"
75,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,5/2/2020,"Wow, I can't believe I had never been to this place until today. Tucked away in a small side street, this spot was a true gem. I got to try the Sakura Matcha Milk and it was incredible!!!! One of the best drinks I've ever had hands down. When I went to pick it up, the food that they were serving up also smelled amazing. Honestly, I can't wait to be back to try their poke bowls. For now, I highly recommended their awesome bubble tea!"
76,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,10/12/2020,"I've tried my fair share of Poke bowls in Boston, but the bowls at this spot aren't my favorite. I usually build my own bowls, but the ingredients at Love Art Sushi don't taste as good compared to the other spots i've been to. The sauces are also not very good. Most are too sweet and the staff drowns the poke bowls in sauce. I've eaten here three times and have had the same experience on every occasion. However, Love Art Sushi had great indoor dining before COVID!"
77,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,4/3/2017,"I've been three times within the past 9 days just because of how casual and convenient this place is. The service is pretty good and all the employees have been very friendly.

There are plenty of options for ingredients, sauces, and toppings but you can tell that the ingredients definitely aren't fresh. Decent taste though, considering the price (my bowls usually end up around $10)."
78,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,4/2/2017,"The food was good, with plenty of options. However the amount of poke my friend and I received in each bowl was minuscule. The space is pretty big for a restaurants in Boston, however even with the amount of space there's a lack of actual seats. Would definitely come back for a quick lunch, etc. 
the drinks are amazing. Notable on their own, my friend and I had the lychee cucumber juice and was definitely the highlight of the restaurant."
79,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,7/1/2017,"Mm mm mmm tasty. A friend of mine is always eating here so decided to venture here myself today. 

I got the Fenway Special which is really good. It was had the right amount of everything: rice, spring greens , toppings, salmon, tuna and that sauce mm mm mm. My tummy was satisfied. It wasn't too little nor too filling it was just right.

I also got a drink and it's free refills if you dine in store. I filled my cup halfway with some Peach jasmine Tea which is good and when I finished that I refilled half my cup with the Taro which is soo yummy.

Came back here again just one week later. This is my new found place (love) for very fresh ingredients. Sweet Green is gonna get less of my time now. Shh"
80,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,2/8/2019,"I was getting caught in the rain when my friend had made a pit stop and noticed a sign directing us to Love Art Sushi. This hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant invited me with warm ventilation and the fresh smell of vegetables. 

If you must know, I'm a big fan of sushi and an even bigger fan of poke bowls. The multitude of options I can choose from blew me away, besides the sushi burritos, the poke bowls had a large array of different choices. Also, with the total ending up to be around $11, including a drink, Love Art Sushi seemed like every broke student's dream. An inexpensive yet tasty meal made my rainy afternoon and trip to Boston fulfilling. 

Although Love Art has a simple ordering system and cute decor, the eating experience isn't for the food, it's for the friends. You could easily pick up a bowl on the go and head out, but when you sit there with company, it makes the trip and your time there worth the while. 

I'm beginning to enjoy more and more of my meals when I head out with friends and if you like eating with company then Love Art is a perfect place to eat at. It's a great restaurant for a regular lunch, a hangout, or even a date."
81,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,7/6/2020,Absolutely the best poke bowls in Boston. Loved this place before the pandemic and now order take away from them. Simple pick up system. Their fish is always so fresh and the portions are substantial. Great place!!
82,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,5/16/2019,"Came here for lunch after visiting the Mary Eddy Baker Library nearby. I got the poke bowl with imitation crab, which I believe was called California Dreamin'. It was okay - could have used a bit more flavor and the ingredients were each by themselves just okay. I probably won't come here again."
83,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,7/29/2018,"I really like this place out of everywhere else I've been to in Boston! The fish is consistently fresh and I love their refreshing, bottomless drinks! The interior feels like a cafe and I love to come with my friends to grab a bite and just chat with soothing classical music playing in the background. It's definitely nothing authentic and doesn't quite hit my craving from home in Hawaii, but I'll take it.

I also like how they spell poke correctly at this location, and not culturally appropriate it by trying to add that bizarre Ã© at the end (like ""pokÃ©""). 

One star off for using plastic containers to serve their fish... wasteful and environmentally unfriendly."
84,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,9/20/2019,"For the price of the poke bowls, this is the place of you want some good poke for a relatively cheaper price! You can either make your own bowl completely from scratch or pick off of their menu (which you can also customize a bit to your liking). There's really something for every kind of taste bud. If you prefer to have something lighter, you can choose ponzu for the sauce (their sauces are all quite strong). They even offer the option to torch your bowl which was really cool. I got my customized bowl for only $9. Really nice place to grab a simple casual lunch or dinner."
85,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/3/2019,Loved this place! Had a small poke bowl of my own creation and a makiritto with salmon rainbow poke. Â Delicious. Â Everything was very fresh. Â Also had the Thai iced coffee and iced tea with free in store refills. Â Pleasantly caffeinated and full at the end :)
86,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,4/13/2018,"After braving a cross-country flight and the startling jump from 65 degrees to 30, I needed something to renew my faith in the world. Love Art Sushi was right near my hotel (the Sheraton) so I walked on over. 
They're knowledgeable about gluten AND the miso soup is gluten free! Win-win. My bowl had every imaginable topping and was around 12 bucks, pretty standard for poke. The fish was really fresh and well flavored. I love spicy poke and this delivered! 
The interior is also really cute and encourages you to linger, which is awesome because I was less than excited about going back outside. CA girl through and through."
87,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,3/22/2019,"4.5*
As you can likely tell from the name, this is a north American interpretation of Japanese food that caters to young people. That being said, for the most part they're doing a great job.
 
The fish has been consistently fresh which is already a win in my book. Aside from their bowls, they also offer snack sized mini maki rolls which are quite delicious and won't break the bank! 

The staff, like most of the clientele, consists of young college students who are generally very attentive and pleasant save the occasional ""too cool for school"" kid who looks like he would rather be anywhere else than taking your order! 

Overall, a very pleasant experience and a cut above the rest of the options close to symphony when it comes to a quick meal."
88,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,4/25/2018,"First time into Love Art Sushi... loved the space, love the art, love that there is a fab poke place right around the corner from where I live.

It's definitely a little confusing, but I had expert help behind the counter. The ""poke master"" as I call her (in my head) had recommended the Hawaiian bowl, which was delish. And I added a handroll (they had a fancy name for it that I escapes me at the moment). 

All of it delish. Will go back again. 

It's not 5 stars only because it can't compete with to the delishness of west coast (or NYC) poke bowls, but for Boston, it's definitely bomb."
89,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,8/7/2019,"My boyfriend and I tried this place today, as our go-to poke place is always pokeworks.

The great things about Love Art Sushi is that you pay a bit less for a three-protein bowl (about $12 versus $15 at pokeworks), and that they have a great drink selection (pokeworks is kinda lacking in that sense). They had taro tea, white peach tea, Viet coffee, cucumber lychee, and strawberry lemonade, as well as refrigerated drinks like ramune! They even had a small snack selection with things like chips and candies. The salmon and tuna were also very delicious. 

The cons... not a great add-in selection in my opinion--pokeworks has better options/-: I only got the kale and edamame whereas at pokeworks I get like 8 add-ins. Also, no dogs are allowed unfortunately (pokeworks allows them). I understand the reasoning behind this so I'm completely ok with it, but there are absolutely no signs outside that say dogs aren't allowed or that only service animals are permitted, which makes it a little confusing. 

All in all I would go back here, but not as often as pokeworks. I didn't try to make this a competition lol it's just that pokeworks was the only comparison I could think of!"
0,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,4/11/2022,"When a friend first suggested this place, I thought it was related to Earl of Sandwich in Downtown Disney. But Earls Kitchen + Bar is quite different! It's a nice restaurant, a solid staple especially given its proximity to the convention center. 

=Earls Bar by night=
Drinks are good here. Their cocktail menu is simple yet creative, featuring classics as well a handful of their own creations. They look pretty in the online menu pictures, but in reality it was too dark to appreciate the aesthetics. 

I got the COCONUT MATCHA SOUR (Tanqueray gin, matcha, passion fruit, fresh lime, coconut water, egg whites, kiwi extract). The taste was on point, and it came with a lot of coconut chips. For a tipsy Yelper like me, it was a nice snack to crunch on; however a craft cocktail purist may be less enthused, since it does throw off the balance.

My friends got the yuzu collins, ultraviolet lychee cocktail, and margaritas and everyone enjoyed their drinks. We got Don Julio shots too. Our server was friendly and attentive. We never got our additional round of drink orders, but that's probably for the better. Cocktails are ~$15 each, which is reasonable.

=Earls Kitchen by day=
We were seated at the patio, which was a beautiful and roomy space, with lots of greenery. Because of the heater, roof, and windows, it had all the relaxing vibes of outdoor seating without needing to brave the elements (I guess in Boston you can't really have an open rooftop bar...)

For starters, we shared the WARM SPINACH & 3 CHEESE DIP (pretty good! Ended up tasting like guac) and BUFFALO CAULIFLOWER (nothing too special, cauliflower pieces were small and had a lot of batter). 

The EARLS FAMOUS CLAM CHOWDER was satisfying, and I liked how it wasn't too salty or creamy. I got the MISO GLAZED SEA BASS + DASHI SOAKED GRAINS, but I sort of wish I got something more conventional like crab cakes, salmon, or steak. I appreciate all the thought that went into this dish with the shiro miso marinade, mushroom dashi broth that arrived on the side, and bok choy; however, it seemed somewhat like a hodgepodge of Asian-inspired flavors on top of the sea bass. I can't say the tri-colored quinoa paired well either, and the edamame were a bit distracting. Nonetheless, service was good and I still loved the ambiance.

Overall, Earls is an excellent choice if you're in the area. It's spacious and has a lot of variety on the menu, along with good drinks."
1,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,4/11/2022,"I've been coming to Earls for some time now as they have good food and drinks for a decent price. I decided to come here last night for a birthday dinner at 6:30pm with two other friends. We got some drinks at the bar downstairs as we were early and closed our tab when our table was ready. All went well up until we were seated. Things started to go downhill from there. 

We got to the hostess stand upstairs and we were told that our reservation was deleted and had to wait a little bit more for a table. There were clearly many open tables for a party of 3 but they decided to give us the short end of the stick and sit us at one of those high tops by the upstairs bar. The table was super uncomfortable and I could just see how we weren't going to fit our meals on this table. I had called over our server Paul and he had taken about 20 minutes to ask the hostess to switch us to another table. From here, we were all set and ready to order but no one came by to give us water or to take our order. I had called over another server but she had stated that Paul was still our server and we had to wait for him to take our orders. My party and I had made clear eye contact with Paul but he really didn't seem to care to come by and ask. We overall waited an HOUR for someone to come by which just made us lose our appetite. There was absolutely no communication within the servers from my perspective and it just seemed like no one wanted to bother with our table. We just made an executive decision to leave since we already closed our tabs downstairs and finished our drinks. Super disappointing because it was a birthday dinner and this seemed very disorganized."
2,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,4/8/2022,"I've been to Earls before for drinks, but this was the first time that I was there to have the food. I was there for lunch and it was fairly busy though not as packed as I thought it would be given the fact that there were no reservations available for almost any other timeslots. There were quite a few open tables, so I was confused as to why it seemed like there was no availability when there really was.

In terms of the food I would say the appetizers were pretty solid. The buffalo cauliflower was OK, with a little bit of buffalo sauce on top of some of the cauliflower. The calamari was pretty good. I liked the addition of jalapeÃ±os and asparagus and other veggies with it.

With respect to the entree, I got the lobster and shrimp ravioli and could say that I was thoroughly disappointed. There was very little lobster and shrimp on top of the pasta, the ravioli itself only had cheese which was very powdery and gritty, and the sauce was watery. I would not recommend getting the lobster and shrimp ravioli dish, especially given the price point. Part of the shrimp wasn't cooked as well which was concerning. 

The overall vibe of the place is nice, and the staff does a great job to keep everything going smoothly given a how hectic it can get. I would honestly come back for drinks and the atmosphere but don't think that I would come back for the food here."
3,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,3/20/2022,"I came here for a quick take-out meal and sat for a drink. Michael was a phenomenal bartender, and Tyler, the host, went above and beyond to deliver my take-out meal. 

It was so good that I came back the next day, since I heard they have a beautiful outdoor patio overlooking the city. It was raining, but we found that upstairs was even nicer than the bar downstairs, and huge! I ordered the steak + sushi and I got a chocolate cake. They forgot to put a candle in for my birthday, but I'm glad they didn't sing to me so it's cool. 

Josh was the most perfect server, he was super attentive and personable. He helped our table convert from a 6-person to a 3 party, and was able to balance the demands of the busy Saturday night, while making sure everything was absolutely perfect at our table. Corrine, the manager, was amazing and came out because I made a small complaint, which wasn't a big deal, but the gesture was huge! She's from out of state so she's not part of the typical staff, but I wanted to make sure she got her flowers for being extremely attentive and concerned. It's not really my business, but all of the people I've named absolutely deserve a raise for being phenomenal. My friends loved their steak, and it's a cool place to stop for food or drink!

They also make really good drinks, they're not too watered down like other local places. I came here 3 days in a row because I knew it was dependable for a good time and satisfying beverages, food + service. 

Also, it's very social media friendly. Every corner is perfectly designed to be Instagram-worthy, FYI. They have a nice, low-key bar downstairs, and they have a cool stairway up to the top floor. They also have an elevator for accessibility.

4,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,3/20/2022,"The good:
Great place for after work drinks and a few sharable dishes. Â Busy, fun people watching and good bar staff. 

The bad: The main course I had was the steak and it was ok at best and for the price was not worth the spend. Â Also had the spicy tuna roll and it was supermarket quality, maybe under. Â 

Summary, great for drinks and small plates, skip main courses."

Had a Spicy Chicken Sandwich and Bigger Burger Â which from the pics u can tell how delicious it was.
5stars from me all the way. Ziveli!!!"
6,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,3/3/2022,"We were agonizing over where to enjoy a rare meal in Boston and Earls was an excellent choice that exceeded my expectations. 

We popped in for lunch on a Tuesday. We work nights Sat-Mon so Tuesday brunch/lunch is typically a splurge meal and I will demonstrate that for you shortly. 

First impression: gorgeous dining area. Part of the kitchen is open so you occasionally spot a giant flame ball roaring above the stove. 

Our waitress was perky and friendly. Unfortunately, she broke the news that they hadn't received a delivery yet so they were missing quite a significant number of ingredients from the bar and therefore, many of the drinks on the menu were not available. Otherwise, I like that they have a ""better for you booze"" section with low sugar, low cal, and low alcohol options in case you're going for more of that kind of vibe. 

I, despite appreciating that fact, was not going for that kind of vibe. Fortunately, they did have all of the components of the cocktail I was eyeing, the PB&J with skrewball pb whiskey (where can I buy that shit lol), raspberry jelly, red wine, and fresh lemon and HOLY SHIT as I tipsily complimented the waitress, this may be one of the best drinks I've ever had and I certainly have enough data in that department. 

GF ordered a spicy mango margarita suggested by the waitress because they were out of an ingredient of her first choice, the pineapple mezcal sour (mezcal, lillet blanc, pineapple, and fresh lime juice) which she very much enjoyed. 

There were too many enticing options on the menu for us to do a standard, I-order-something-and-you-order-something deal. I'm vegetarian, and they conveniently have the plant based options in a specified section of the menu. 

Crispy tofu sushi tacos- crispy tofu, sriracha mayo, pickled ginger, and fresh shisho. Delicious. The tofu was certainly crispy and the flavors of these tacos mingled beautifully. 

Vegan buffalo cauliflower- so so so good. The buffalo sauce was bold and tasty and a perfect contrast to the cool vegan ranch dip that allowed me to even enjoy the accompanying celery stalks. 

Warm spinach and three cheese dip- oh my goddddddd. This was so good and CREAMY. This was old faithful of the meal that I kept coming back to in between samplings of everything else. 

Mother earth bowl- I saw this and it looked so fucking healthy and I just had to get it to cram all of that nutrition down my pie hole. Romaine lettuce, mixed greens, roasted yams, cauliflower, cheddar, quinoa almond crumble, broccoli pesto, white balsamic dressing. I ordered this for my soul aka to keep things moving in my belly but it was just as enjoyable as everything else. 

GF also couldn't resist the chipotle calamari-""very good, it was spicy and smoky with a nice crunch. The fried vegetables [included in the dish] were another nice touch"". 

I initially ordered all that shit with the intention of bringing some back to the hotel for later but panicked before the food was brought out that our hotel room didn't have a fridge. We had absolutely no trouble whatsoever eating everything and despite binging, didn't feel like complete shit about it which is a nice change after our usual taco bell binges lmao. 

I would also like to add that the food came out SUSPICIOUSLY quickly. 

This was an excellent choice and I couldn't recommend it more."
7,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,2/17/2022,"First time trying this place. My expectations were met overall in food, ambiance and service! I am so glad I made reservations on open table as this is a popular restaurant. Wanted to find a place for myself to enjoy and relax. I was greeted by the kindhearted and friendly Letty and my server Sean was so sweet and attentive! They are the final reason I gave 5 stars as they took my overall experience to that level!! Â The food was delicious, flavorful and pleasing to the eye.
For my appetizer I enjoyed the 
Buffalo Cauliflower
Tender cauliflower, buffalo sauce

My entree Crispy Tofu Zen Bowl
Jasmine rice, avocado, daikon, red cabbage, snap peas, sesame salt
(Delicious I had leftover to enjoy for later) 

Dessert Key Lime Pie
Graham cracker crust, whipped chantilly cream, 
Yum!!! A few bites and I was satisfied! 

Ambiance was comforting and welcoming! I can't wait to come back and try other options on the menu. Thank you!!!"
8,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,12/28/2021,"This was my first time at Earls, I've heard a lot about it. My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary. We started with the classic margarita, I had the mango and my boyfriend had raspberry. We both enjoyed them. Then for apps we got the Buffalo cauliflower and the truffle fries. The Buffalo cauliflower is probably the best cauliflower I've ever had. It was fried and the sauce was so good. 

Then for dinner I had the lobster and shrimp ravioli, which was delicious. The ravioli itself was so good. My boyfriend had the Thai curry with shrimp. His rice was cold and also kinda hard. 

The server was nice but it was very clear he was trying to upsell everything. Then he would get visibly upset when you didn't want whatever he was trying to up charge you for. He was also a judgy when we were picking drinks. He was very attentive but it just came off a little aggressive."
9,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,3/11/2022,Went here for a quick drink and appetizer in downtown Boston. Both were great. Only knock I would say is that the staff wasn't the friendliest in our experience.
10,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,3/9/2022,"Arrived in Boston around 11PM, and Earls was one of the only places open. We had to wait a while to get a table without a reservation, but we were surprised by how busy it was--lots of young professionals hanging out. 

The table shared truffle fries and calamari. The truffle fries were disappointing, as they were pretty soggy and there weren't a lot of them. The calamari was great though! I enjoyed the pickled onions and how there were cauliflower pieces. 

I ordered the salad with chicken while my friends tried out the sandwiches and burgers. The salad itself was great, but I paid extra for chicken that didn't taste that great. I had a little bit of my friend's burgers and those were hefty and could definitely make for two portions depending on your appetite. 

Overall, the food was alright but the high prices and lack of unique options attribute to an average rating."
11,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,2/15/2022,"At a convention and there's not many places offering indoor seating (thanks COVID). Â  This one offered drinks and food, something I was looking for! My passion fruit mule was refreshing and tasted soooo good! Â I ordered ahÃ­ tuna poke bowl and was so pleased. Â It was eye pleasing and flavors were there. Â My peer ordered clam chowder- yum!! Service was great until it was time to settle up, then we had to wait 30 additional minutes. Â All in all, I'd recommend. Â They also offer happy hour, worth returning."
12,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,3/20/2022,"If you are visiting Boston, I would skip out on this place. The place is beautifully decorated and trendy and in a prime location. However, the service was terribly slow where we hadn't seen our waitress for 15-20 minutes after being seated. The place wasn't too busy on a Sunday afternoon in March so I'm not sure what the reason was. The food came out in a fair amount of time as well as the drinks. The food was lacking so much flavor and seasoning. We came for brunch and the food tasted very bland and had no seasoning at all. The menu sounds delicious and is presented very nice but the taste wasn't there."
13,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,10/19/2021,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning with a reservation for two. I'd recommend making a resy for brunch especially as Earl's gets busy very easily!

The deal for brunch is fantastic. I find this to be a solid choice for well-priced food and a lively, fun atmosphere. The service is kind as well and very efficient - we got our food within a reasonable time and it was delicious. Their mimosas as well are moderately priced and complemented the food very well!

I found the eggs benedict to be just the right amount of food with the lobster portion to be reasonable given the price. The potatoes were cooked nicely too ( crispy and seasoned well ) and overall the meal felt very balanced. 

Earl's really never disappoints with food or drinks so if you're looking for a pleasant Americana experience, this is the place to go!"
14,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,1/1/2022,"Let me say, our bartenders Michael and Jeo were great!
My food...not so much.
Upon my first bite of my seafood eggs Benny it was cold. Jeo promptly took it back to the kitchen to be remade. 
When they brought it back out, while the hollandaise sauce was now lukewarm, the seafood was cold (I truly hope I don't end up ill)
I ate it because I refuse to send something back twice, I'm not ""that"" person and you can tell that by all my other reviews 
Your chef needs to make themself what they served me and ask themself if they would eat it the way it was served. 
Potatoes were hot, drinks were fantastic and my boyfriends food was great. 
Atmosphere is very chill."
15,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,4/7/2022,"Oh my gosh. Othon, cannot speak highly enough about his service, etiquette, and overall knowledge. I told him things I like, things I don't like, and he was able to create one of the most amazing drinks I've ever tasted. EVER!!

It was a a clothed and unknown (play on a naked and famous)--vodka, elderflower, pineapple, lime, Campari and love 

If you ever go to earls (which you should), ask him to craft you a drink and he will make you something completely amazing Â that you'll be craving for the whole week (it'll make your mouth tingle with joy)! He's completely fire and I wish I could rub my hands through is thick hair ughh 

Check out earls in the prudential!"
16,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,7/8/2021,"Earls is a must visit restaurant in Boston. They have a large variety of dishes across many cuisines. I loved coming to earls for brunch and happy hour since their dishes are both delicious and pretty decently priced.

They also occasionally have $7-$10 cocktails which Is always great! The cocktails are all super delicious and there's a wide range of different cocktails to meet your preferences.

Earls is always a great place to visit when you're in the back Bay Area!! I would definitely recommend!!"
17,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,8/27/2021,"Visiting Boston for the weekend and was glad to check out this brunch spot! 

I honestly love the interior design of this place. Everything was super pretty and nice. We got a sushi platter, a beer Cali burger with truffle fries, and a lobster + shrimp Benedict. I really like the mango ale drink that I got. The beer is really fresh and just delicious. Our server was super nice and helpful. Overall a nice visit and great brunch spot to stop by! 

The only thing about this place is that the AC is super strong so make sure to bring a cardigan or something if you get cold easily!"
18,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,2/17/2022,"I've been coming to Earls since the beginning of college and I love the atmosphere. They have monthly drinks at a cheaper value, so definitely check them out. I love their truffle fries and spinach dip, but I would skip out on their calamari because they add a lot of fluff like cauliflower and the amount of squid that comes with it doesn't justify ordering it."
19,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,12/15/2021,"Never had a bad meal here. I highly recommend making a reservation. They have a lovely patio that's open year round. Ask what their $7 drink special is, this month it was sangria. Their cocktail menu is also full of delicious, creative concoctions. If you get a burger, it's mandatory to get the truffle fries as they are really that good."
20,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"I love the vibes here. Walked in for dinner one evening. We ordered a few drinks while waiting for our table. I ordered a hot toddy and my boyfriend ordered a couple margaritas, I think. Drinks were good. Mine took a rather long time to be prepared but was great when I finally got it. Once at the table we ordered steak. Tasted wonderful. We had an enjoyable dinner here. I recommend."
21,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,2/13/2022,"Stopped by this popular restaurant one night for dinner and everything was perfect. Our waitress, Christy, went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. I had the crispy ribs (perfectly cooked) and truffle fries which I highly recommend. Cocktails were typically priced. The restaurant was busy and loud at times, but everything was delivered in a timely manner. Overall, the service and experience was great. I would visit again for dinner and recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a casual dinner spot. 

Wrong Earls-- this is for Earls in Somerville!"
22,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,11/8/2021,"Delish. On a solo trip to Boston, came across this gem from the amazing Yelp reviews. Sat outside at the bar counter (all outside is heated and enclosed) and the bartender was super sweet. Got the passionfruit mule and the blackened chicken plate. Both were AMAZING. The chicken was perfectly cooked and was super moist. Out of all the places in Boston, I would pick this place again. Super happy with my experience here."
23,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,3/9/2022,"Came for midday apps and cocktails last weekend - and wow! Our server Nadine was amazing! So sweet and helpful, especially with our dietary restrictions and multitude of menu questions. 

With her lead, we selected an incredible range of dishes - highlights include the buffalo cauliflower, the spring greens & grains salad, and the truffle fries! The red & white sangria were absolutely delicious as well. 

We had a great experience! Can't wait for the chance to return."

26,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,1/29/2022,"We went during a blizzard, s/o to all the hard workers who came out and worked at earls during the storm. They were out of quite a few things, which made the dish selection quite difficult. I decided on the crab cake appetizer. It was really good! We also got the salmon that came with a crispy onion rice and asparagus. It was spicy but good. We got the clam chowder which wasn't too creamy and had lots of meat. Not pictured were the truffle fries. Highlight of the meal for sure!"
27,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,5/24/2021,"Went here for brunch about a week ago. We sat in the outdoor area with a retractable roof. Fairly standard brunch food - the chicken was overcooked for the chicken and waffles. The shrimp and lobster benedict was good though - I liked that the hollandaise sauce was on the milder side. Both were good portion sizes and prices were very fair since we went during brunch happy hour. Mimosa and rose sangria were fine too. The mimosa was heavier on the champagne than the orange juice (which we certainly didn't mind) and the rose sangria was very sweet.

The outside tables could use more cleaning. There were a lot of food pieces between the slots of the table top, even though we were the first people to sit there that day. The contactless code for our table didn't work which required the server to come to our table."
28,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,10/3/2021,"Earls has instantly become one of my favorite restaurants in Back Bay. First off the location is super convenient, once you've finished at Earls you can take a shopping trip around Prudential. The food and drink? Absolutely amazing. The drinks themselves are all so good, the Ultraviolet Lychee Cocktail is not only aesthetic, but also very refreshing. The Moscow Mules are also very good, gingery and sweet. You can easily just come here to enjoy the drinks alone.

The truffle fries are addicting, they're thinly cut so not only are they crispy but also fluffy within. The 14oz Ribeye with buttery mashed potatoes was the best part of the meal. Their steaks are tender, flavorful, and after spreading truffle butter across it completely elevated the dish. The mashed potatoes are smooth and buttery with crispy fried onion strips on top, so delicious. Can't wait to come back soon!"
29,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,2/19/2022,"Their happy hour (11-noon) has great prices and the food is good too! Adorable restaurant inside prudential center so you can shop around and walk off the food coma afterwards. Espresso martini is rly strong, beware."

31,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,9/28/2021,"I heard great things about Earls and decided to try them out while I was in town and I highly recommend! Everyone is super friendly and my waitress was very nice and welcoming. 

She recommended I try the ultraviolet lychee cocktail and it was very delicious. I also had the steak frites and devoured my dish. The only issue with my steak is that it was rare medium when I asked for medium well. It was still pretty good and the flavors were on point. 

Excellent location located in the mall and near many great shops. Add this location on your list to come to!"
32,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,8/29/2021,"I got the Ahi Tuna Tartare Tower; Sushi Platter with Yuzu Crab, Crispy Tofu, + Crispy Shrimp; Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl; and Thai Prawn Curry Bowl. My favorite was the Ahi Tuna Tartare with the pairing of crispy wonton chips.

I would give the food taste a 3.5 but I added 0.5 for the presentation.

The ambiance in the restaurant is modern and sophisticated but not to the point of it feeling traditional and stuffy. I would recommend outdoor seating as it's dimly lit indoors. 

Overall, I really recommend trying Earl's but the overall experience was better than the food. I recommend you try it for date night but do keep in mind it is a bit pricey."
33,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,8/20/2021,"What a great spot! We came here for brunch and made reservations to sit on the roof deck patio on a Saturday. Definitely make sure you make your reservations! I love the brunch happy hour menu which has many of the brunch options at a slightly cheaper price! I would recommend the lobster and shrimp Benedict. We also got calamari and fries which were on the normal brunch menu -- calamari was good while fries were just average. We also got the half off champagne and OJ on the happy hour menu. Just beware that the price is actually already listed as 50% off! We weren't aware of that, but it actually still ended being a good deal when split amongst 4 people. Our waiter was also very friendly and nice. Good food and great vibes for brunch!"

Full disclosure, I didn't get their brunch food but I still loved everything haha I got the Spicy Tuna Roll and their famous Clam Chowder. The chowder was delicious and not as thick as a lot of clam chowder's that I've had. It also had tomatoes in it, which I liked. All their rolls look very cool and the spicy tuna roll was so different than the standard. This one had some crispy onion flakes on top, that made it all the more delicious. The interior is so cute and there's a greenhouse looking area that you can sit in as well. Overall, 10/10!!"
36,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,3/13/2021,"**This review is during the COVID-19 guidelines for indoor dining. 

My friends and I came here for Saturday lunch and made a reservation a week before--which I highly recommend if you want to avoid a long wait!

Food: 5/5
I ordered the Vegan Quinoa + Avocado Powerbowl, which comes with roasted squash, beets, roasted pumpkin seeds, and crispy chickpeas. It was well-spiced, the portion size was decent, and the ingredients were all really fresh. I'd order it again in a heartbeat! The calamari was good but nothing special, the ahi tuna dish looked refreshing, and the chicken tacos seemed flavorful.

Drinks: 5/5
I didn't order any drinks, but my friends ordered some cocktails and they were fairly impressed.
Tokyo Cosmo - Citrusy, perfectly sweet
Raspberry Mojito - Refreshingly sweet raspberry cocktail
Mimosa - simple & sweet

Atmosphere: 4/5
The interior design is gorgeous, and it's a great place to go for brunch with friends or a date night.

Service: 4/5
We did feel a bit rushed since multiple servers came to check on us often (even though we were well within our 90 minute window), but the service was friendly and accommodating overall. I appreciated the payment process; you scan a QR code, and after you order, your virtual bill is automatically calculated and even splits the check between everyone at the table--I thought it was very innovative.

Overall, we had a great experience--a bit on the pricey side, but the food was tasty, the drinks were impressive, Â the atmosphere was lively, and the service was friendly."
37,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,12/17/2021,"Love the creative healthier cocktails. I tried the lychee one, which also has ube in it. The portion sizes are large. The salmon is a bit over cooked and not crispy on the outside. The crab cakes are good!"
38,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,7/15/2021,"Ok so I'm debating on giving 3 or 4 stars because the food is alright, it's just really really uninteresting. 

So the location? It's GORGEOUS! Amazing! If you're a banker or work in a six or seven figure earning job than this is a nice looking place to bring some coworkers/clients for a drink or quick lunch. 
When I say pretty I mean it, the designer they hired did an excellent job. The materials of the tables and walls to flow of everything is great. A bit corporate-y but gorgeous. And what I mean is that it certainly doesn't show off any personality, no ones dream was this design. It's a upscale design firms work to appease a big client at a flagship location. 

Biggest Gripes - store bought sauces and presentation. 
BBQ ribs are over cooked slightly and slow cooked which while moist and tasty. They fall off the bone too much because they have been left in a slow cookers liquid for too long. And the sauce used tastes good but not made in restaurant, I'm speculating but am almost positive this is a particular sauce you can pick up at you local super market. So for the $30 you are getting some ribs and a tad dry but still good chicken and ribs. 
Don't get me wrong Â the ribs were good but they were store bought stuff and made in slow cooker. For $30 you can actually get a slow cooker and a full rack of ribs! At the price point I'm expecting new flavours, something the chef has tinkered with and made his own. Wood fired, smoked, grilled even just something interesting flavour wise. 
This was the theme at Earls, everything tasted Good! But nothing was interesting flavour wise and it was a little bland and very generic. I wonder if Earls gives the chefs here any control over the menu to explore themselves creatively through the menu but I suspect not. A lot seems to be designed to make passable food that's tasty and price hike it to cater to the locations I'm sure ludicrous rent and their bottom line. 

Tacos were given this generic hot sauce in a the stores bottle with a label on it. At a place like Earls with their pricing relative to the market you come to expect a homemade sauce the chefs curated, or at the very least this store bought hot sauce in a nice serving glass of some sort. The label is just tacky in a place like this. Â 

Sushi was a bit bland and odd (fried shrimp) but in line with it all quite good. 

TLDR: Gorgeous place, good but uninteresting non passionful food. Wait staff was good attentive but not anything incredible either. If they want to make this place a top pick in Boston I'd say let your executive/head chef(s) experiment with the menu and food a bit and come out with some of their own stuff and lose the entirely safe dish menu that a corporate market study determined to be the best fitted food statistically to be ordered by the demographics."
39,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,1/7/2022,"I came here several times already and finally decided to write a review. I tend to come here during the brunch/lunch hours, and each time I'm never disappointed. The happy hour menu is so worth it and I believe it's 2-5 Monday-Friday. I got the seafood platter which had almost everything I loved; it came with lobster tail, shrimp cocktail (my absolute favorite), oysters, tuna salad I believe with chips, and tofu sushi. However, the sushi was not good at all so don't look forward to that. Other than that, everything was satisfying and good especially for the price. I would highly recommend coming here while you're shopping at the Prudential!"

Additionally many items from the drinks were out of stock sadly. Our server was really nice since we had a party of 8 celebrating a birthday.

46,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,1/1/2021,"Stopped here for lunch after shopping around Boston. And by stopped, we made a reservation a few days before. I would recommend making one as they were very busy and had a long wait!

The atmosphere was great, the rooftop looks over the city and is surrounded by tall buildings. The interior of the restaurant is very well done and a great spot to have lunch. 

The food was awesome, and if you can take advantage of happy hour you can leave with getting a fairly reasonable meal! The Christmas sangria was great and for happy hour only cost $7. For a starter the spinach dip was great and not greasy, the feta added a nice touch. For lunch I had the lobster tostadas and if you get an appetizer and don't want to overdue it this is a great option. Enough lobster to get your fix, and the flavors don't overpower the New England lobster flavor that you're looking for. 

All in all very happy with this stop, the service was great, our server was pleasant. Would definitely come again!"
47,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,12/30/2021,"I've been to Earls four times now and two of those times have been some of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. When I mean bad, I mean dangerous for your health. Upon receiving my cocktail, there was a woman's lipstick pattern imprinted on the rim of glass - clearly they had not thoroughly washed the glass. In seeing this, I am not sure how clean any of the glassware or utensils are in this establishment. It is hard for me to view this experience with anything but disgust.

On top of this, I ordered the the curry chicken bowl and when I received my dish, it was missing the chicken. The name of the dish has only two ingredients- curry and CHICKEN. I had to wait an extra 20 minutes after waiting at least half an hour.

I was going to let my first bad experience of this restaurant slide but this most recent one solidified my view - do not recommend."
48,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,11/13/2021,"I went here for the first time a few weeks ago with some friends late at night for some drinks and snacks. First off, the interior design here is very cool! It's very modern and fancy looking inside. We got seated in the deepest part of the restaurant in a booth area next to some bushes. We ordered the house margarita special which was great and cheap (less than $10). For food we got the truffle fries and they were delicious! The portion is on the smaller side so we ordered two. The only negative thing was that we did see a rat by our table. We did notify our server, but the rat was gone by then. Overall, cool place for food and drinks at a convenient location."
49,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,7/10/2021,The food was great!!!! We loved our dinner here at Earls. We had a burger and chicken tacos and both were very tasty. The only thing we didn't like was how LOUD it was. It felt like we were having a dinner at a nightclub.
50,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,2/28/2022,"First time dining here - based on how tough it's been to get a table here in the past, I was expecting a fairly good experience 
My experience was poor from the start - the hostess in the 1st floor told me they had a table, and she took my name, phone number - then pointed me to go upstairs to the hostess on the 2nd floor - that hostess struggled to find me in her queue for a table for some reason - but after a few minutes agreed to seat us in a round banquette 
We then waited quite a while for Dylan our waiter to acknowledge us, about 10 minutes after we were seated. Â 
We placed our order for drinks, appetizer's and entrees all at once. 
It took 20 minutes and 3 requests to get my first drink 
And another 20 minutes for my 2nd drink. When I asked the runner who was bringing the drinks what the issue was with the delayed drinks.........she seemed puzzled and assured me there were no issues at the bar? 
The food came in a timely manner, no issues there........except the food is over-priced for the quality - and you can see by the pictures, presentation is non existent. 
I asked for additional chips for the spinach dip - and waited about 20 minutes for the chips to arrive (I actually gave up and assumed they forgot about my request for more chips). Dylan explained to me later that they ran out of chips and someone ran to the store to get more - 
I asked for the check from Dylan, I put my credit card down as soon as he put the paper bill on the table 
He went by our table after that, Foy used on other tables - but when a manager asked she could get us anything else, I thanked her and stated I just wanted to pay the bill and get out of there 
Tyler is one of the managers - he stopped by a couple times and apologized for the poor service- he offered to comp the appetizers, I said no thank you - 
I assumed Dylan must be new, and that is why the service was so poor, but Tyler assured my Dylan is not new - so I replied that he needs more support from Managment OR more training maybe? 
This Earle's location seemed to be very well staffed this Monday night that I dined here - so, I am incredibly confused why my experience was so poor and it is is in complete contrast to most of the reviews here.........
I was torn between Earle's, Douzo, Cheesecake Factory and Fogo De Chao - any of the other portions could not have been worse than my experience at Earle's 
All around an incredibly bad experience that I had high hopes for............"
51,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,7/8/2021,"Honestly a great brunch place with a beautiful patio! I would say the food and drinks are ok but the ambiance of the place makes up for it. We came here since the friendly toast had a huge wait time. We had a table for 6 and after ordering, we were told there were some problems with our order. The both times I've been here, they are wonderful at accommodating for kitchen issues and I really appreciate that!"
52,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,11/21/2021,"Kalem is the best server we've ever had! He is very good with recommendations of passion fruit drinks and preparing spare napkins, ketchup, Sriracha aÃ¯oli sauces, and extra plates in case we wanted to share! He's beyond nice and he's very handsome with a very soothing voice and was completely professional! Side note the music here is amazing (: we recommend the crispy ribs and fried shrimp tacos off the happy hour menu along with the Atlantic salmon asparagus and rice. It's so clear that Kalem works incredibly hard and deserves a raise!! He is one of the many reasons that we will be coming back and we appreciate his check ins!!"
53,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,5/15/2021,"We had a beautiful dinner at Earl's this past Wednesday! We ate on the patio and it was absolutely love. The waitstaff were so kind and friendly, and made me laugh while I was waiting for my friend to arrive. The waiters were super cute too - especially one guy! Not that you should dine here for the cute waitstaff but hey, it doesn't hurt right? :)

The tables are safely distanced and they have QR code's for the menus. To start, we had the warm spinach dip. It was OK, but I probably wouldn't order it again. For my main course, I had the 6 ounce filet and mashed potatoes. That was SO good! I paired it with a lovely dry rose. All in all, a great meal and I will definitely be back!"
54,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,5/30/2021,"I've been to Earls a few times now, and never been Â disappointed with the service or food. It has a nice interior, artwork, and is spacious for a large party or small gathering. 

It was my first time having brunch with them, and I ordered chicken and waffles. I have had chicken and waffles at other places before, and never felt satisfied, but this time was different. I really liked the way the chicken was cooked here. It was very crispy and moist, plus well seasoned. There was also some heat to it which was a bit unexpected but good nonetheless. My friends ordered lobster and shrimp omelette, lobster Benedict, and breakfast burger. They all seemed to enjoy their individual meals, and we all pretty much finished our plates. The only thing that was a bit underwhelming was my frozen margarita which was more slush than anything. Â It tasted a little weak, which was disappointing because I've ordered drinks from Earls before, and they are usually good and strong, but overall, restaurant is good and somewhere I'd return to for future meals."
55,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,2/8/2022,Ambiance is really modern and cool. The food is good. I got the shrimp and lobster benedict which I enjoyed. The potatoes are crispy and well seasoned. I split a burger with a friend which was good as well. The mules are good and my friend enjoyed their espresso martini. Would come back again!
56,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,12/27/2021,90% of the staff has covid and management refuses to close for even a day. This is not new behavior for this place. Oysters were delicious! Wish I could give less than one star
57,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,4/26/2021,"I've come for drinks and dinner and it was great. However, brunch was just okay. Two of us ordered the eggs benny, but the eggs were overcooked, which was really disappointing. Buffalo cauliflower and chicken and waffles looked good, but service was slow and not the friendliest."
58,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,6/22/2021,"Came for lunch and I loved it! Ambiance was great and our server (I think his name was Michael) had amazing energy. I really appreciated his service and suggestions.

I had a yuzu crab roll and it was a fresh twist on the kind of classic sushi rolls you find in Southern California. I also tried a bite of the crispy shrimp roll, and it seemed to resemble a standard crunch roll but deconstructed. Friends reported that the poke bowls were filling and delicious as well.

Overall, it was a lovely experience and a great way to kick off visiting Boston."
59,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,11/7/2020,"Four stars for the food. Two stars for the service. 

Food: Notable mentions were the chicken and waffle, and the salt and pepper wings (appetizer). The Nashville fried chicken thighs were juicy, spicy and done just right. Waffles slightly overdone. Soft drink was 4.75. Definitely pricey for the value. 

Service: server got the wrong order, no napkin and silverware for a long time. 

Nice outdoor /patio seating though. You are probably paying for the atmosphere more than anything."
60,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,2/26/2022,"An ideal restaurant. 
Food: I liked it a lot. I have no complaints. 
Environment: an interesting and varied floor plan combined with suitably old yet fuzzy music and dimmer lighting gave the place a nice and private atmosphere while maintaining energy. 
Service: this was top notch. Shane T., our server, was incredibly energetic and helpful. I have a gluten allergy, and he was fully receptive to all of my questions and ran to the kitchen several times just to make sure that things were properly gluten free. That is a level of care that I have not experienced in the last year, and was wonderful. Overall a terrific experience."
61,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,11/4/2021,"I went here with my mom and my friend to celebrate saying yes to the dress!! Our waiter was super kind and brought us complimentary rose drinks as a celebration. As an appetizer I got the new england clam chowder which was delicious, just wish they had oyster crackers to go with it. For the entree, I got the crab cakes which were so yummy too! The dining area is nice as well."
62,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,10/3/2021,"Looking for the perfect spot to talk about your shopping spree in Prudential over drinks? Earls is the place to do it.
The truffle fries were a simple dish that they somehow made extremely addicting with their perfect frying job and the accompanying garlic aioli sauce.
This was topped by the New York striploin which had great fat content that you can see in every piece you cut but gave a good chew as well. The mashed potatoes that it came with had the most delightful fried onions on top and I found myself taking bite after bite no matter how full I got.
But you're not here for the food you're here for the drinks and the drinks at earls NEVER disappoints. Every drink is made for casual drinking and you won't ever taste the alcohol in it. The Moscow mule was so refreshing that I had to get another and the Lychee cocktail was sweet and mild.
This is my absolute number one staple restaurant and I don't think that will be changing any time soon!"

64,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,10/6/2021,"I would definitely recommend coming during their brunch happy hour on Sunday (before noon). I got the eggs Benedict and a friend got the lobster and shrimp omelette. The Eggs in the Benny were nicely cooked and they gave a generous amount of potatoes.

65,Earls Kitchen + Bar,2 star rating,11/27/2021,"I've been to Earls several times in the past in Canada, the food here was very different! The sushi was pre rolled and tasted almost fake, it was not good at all - even grocery store sushi is better. The steak was chewy and only tasted good drenched in sauce. The waitress definitely forgot about me and the restaurant was cold / smelly."

67,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,11/23/2021,"I went to this restaurant for the first time to celebrate a friend's birthday. We were asked to wait on the first floor which was moderately crowded with not many seats to sit and wait. 
For the table, we ordered the calamari. It was crispy and tasted delicious. Beware of the fried jalapeÃ±os because they have a kick. For the entree, I had the steak and sushi combo with the 6oz steak and the crunchy shrimp roll. The sushi was modern and had no seaweed, but also had a little too much cilantro taste for my liking. I ordered the steak rare, which it was, but it was also quite cold when it reached the table. The steak tasted great but would have been much better if it was hot. Overall, the ambiance is great and the service was very friendly."
68,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,10/2/2020,"Had a very tasty bunch here!! Wasn't my first time and definitely won't be my last visit to Earl's! They still do the same discount on Sunday brunch meals as before, so Sundays are definitely the day to plan your brunch! I had the chicken and waffles--it was really flavorful and had a good balance of sweetness and spice. Solid ratio of chicken to waffle as well. 

I also tried the lobster shrimp benedict--also good flavor! Potatoes on the side were tasty and poached egg was cooked well. As with most lobster bennys I wish there was just a liiittle more lobster.

Mimosas were affordable and yummy, no complaints there!

If you're making a reservation on opentable, be warned that they will give you the first available table (can't request outside or inside before getting there, but this wasn't an issue for me!)."
69,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,12/15/2021,"This review is mainly for their customer service. I go to Earl's quite often, pre-COVID this was our favorite Saturday night pre-game place, where ten of us would go and have few drinks before we head out to a club, during COVID we went few times for lunch and drinks but last few times have been really disappointing that made me write this review. Description of my last visit. We went for lunch on a weekday, to begin with, they had patio seating closed because their heating wasn't working there, that was disappointing because during COVID time I prefer patio than indoor seating. Â This is not the first time, last time I visited they had some other issue outside , some Christmas decoration was going on outside so patio was closed, not sure why they don't want to seat people at the patio or just a co-incidence. Secondly, our hostess said the drink of the month is over, where we clearly saw it being served, so she had to get us the first round, which was watery, there wasn't much alcohol in it. Then for the second round she said it's over, then why is it drink of the month when their stock is over in the middle of the month, it's not like wine is perishable and sangrias are made from wine, so it did not make any sense, so we ordered the double priced cocktail which was good, but maybe not worth $17.5. Then comes food, it took them at least 30 minutes to get us food, only to realize that my friend's order was wrong, we couldn't wait because we were starving, so poor guy had to eat alone because his order took another 15 minutes or so and we were starving because the order already took 30 minutes. I ordered the zen bowl which comes with tofu, Â mushroom, snap peas etc. i replaced rice with greens, so my so called zen bowl was greens, cucumber and tofu, that's it, nothing else for $27, it was ridiculous how overpriced the dish was which was missing key ingredients and when I asked the waitress she said it doesn't come with mushrooms and snap peas, then better write that in your menu and change the name to tofu with rice or greens. I had a similar experience last time, their dessert which used to be my favorite, sticky toffee pudding, had no toffee and a tiny scoop of ice cream and waitress said the ice cream is really small so I recommend you order extra scoop (when you know it's small, why don't you offer more), so that scoop was of course extra price and for toffee, she said no we only put toffee when we have it, today we don't have it. Like really, then why don't you inform your guest before ordering. I have so many bad more stories lately about this place which used to be good but is becoming a very poorly run restaurant. They gave us a $10 credit for the mix up, but I feel that was very less compared to the bad service we received. Not sure if these people waitresses/ managers are racist or just poorly trained people, maybe they started hiring untrained people to cut down prices and cheat customers. Whatever it is, all of us decided this won't be our go to spot anymore."
70,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,7/16/2021,"We dined in on Tuesday's evening. We were very excited to come to this place. We came all the way from NY. We felt very unwelcome by the host on the first floor. We were waiting in line for so long when she was chit chatting with the customers in front of us. People behind us just went up so we thought it was okay to do that. Then we went up and she stopped us and made the face. She waved the hands for us to go up without making eye contact and giving any attention. Giving attention to customers is very important but she left me in nowhere. We do not appreciate that at all because the hostess team is the first impression of the restaurant.

However, 5/5 for the food and thank you for an amazing service from the waitress. We at least enjoyed the food and our time at the table after all."
71,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,11/5/2021,"Truly enjoyed the food! Incredible ambiance on the patio, even in the winter. Steak was cooked perfectly, and the truffle mashed potatoes were everyone's favorite."
72,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,7/31/2020,"I came on a Friday evening with my boyfriend and a friend. We had a reservation for seats in the rooftop patio, which was great since I wasn't comfortable with sitting indoors yet. It was pretty crowded, both indoors and outdoors, when we arrived. Luckily, the outdoor seating was spaced relatively far apart.

We ordered truffle fries, and chips and guacamole. I also ordered an old fashioned. The truffle fries were the star of the night! They were so freaking delicious and flavorful! I wish the portions were bigger because I would've happily eaten at least 5 more orders of those truffle fries! The chips and guacamole were fine - exactly as you'd expect. Nothing special. There was a lot of guacamole, and the chips were refillable for free, which was pretty great! The old fashioned was very unique. It had root beer bitters, so if you'll like it if you like root beer.

The waiter was very friendly and attentive! 

Overall, we had a great time! I'm truly obsessed with their truffle fries and can't wait to come back for more!"
73,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,8/26/2021,"Short version: The staff are wonderful, the drinks are good, the food is eh.

I don't usually grimace at the thought of going to Earl's because the food is reliably pleasant, but it's nothing out of this world or that will make you disavow your mother's signature dish. The cocktails however are solid (the earl's old fashioned is my fave). What I can always count on though is pretty decent service and a warm atmosphere. Now, I have been to Earl's on a number of occasions but usually visit the location in Somerville. I will be the first to admit that I'm a bit bougie (bourgeois if you wanna be proper) and am a stickler for customer service. The dÃ©cor and the way that the greenery is infused even for rooftop seating is so pleasant and naturally comforting. The customer service is always attentive and pleasant, but what encouraged me to write a review is May. She went out of her way to just be so on point. We never had to search for her or wait an extended time for anything and this restaurant was pretty busy when we arrived. She was patient, kind, and gave amazing recommendations. Like I said, it wasn't my first time here and likely won't be my last but wanted to be sure that May got her props!

P.S. for the COVID conscious folks. Not sure if staff is fully vaccinated (I'm assuming so), but they are currently operating and not requiring masks for staff, chefs, or guests so it was a bit uncomfortable this go round with the Delta variant and all so I likely won't be back anytime soon. The tables are also not socially distant, but if the awnings are open then their rooftop is an option to minimize risk"
74,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,8/19/2021,"It sucks that one bad experience here forced me to finally write a review.. let me start by saying that I have historically LOVED Earl's. As someone who lives in Back Bay, it is typically a go-to for drinks and apps, and especially when I want to show someone a nice place when they are visiting me in town. I have frequented this place so much, but not sure if I will be returning.

I last went there in May with family who was in town for a graduation. The service was great as usual, and most of the drinks / apps were great as well. I wanted to order the thai curry chicken bowl, but upon the recommendation of the served, I ordered the cajun grilled chicken. Well that was the worst decision I made that day -- upon receiving it, I noticed that it looked severely undercooked and practically inedible. Only the outer layer was somewhat cooked. When I told the server, he dismissed my complaint and stated that it was supposed to look like that and was most likely cooked. I was a bit shocked that they did not listen to such a serious concern, but I trusted my favorite establishment and listened. It was not until later after a eating a few bites and the insistence of my family that I realized that it was most definitely undercooked, and I had no choice but to complain again and physically show my server the inside of my chicken. He apologized profusely and offered to bring me another entree, but I felt sick at the time from the raw meat so I declined.

My family was extremely disappointed that our concerns were not only ignored, but when acknowledged, there was little done to remedy the situation besides an apology. It turned a family celebratory occasion into a night of cramps and stomach pains for me. It is such a shame because I loved Earls, but I honestly do not know if I will ever have a reason to come in again."

76,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,1/3/2021,"We arrived on time for our reservation. It's my first time. The host and hostess were very friendly and warm they told us about the specials. We ordered sushi , salads, lobster ravioli , ribs and fish tacos. They spicy tuna roll was excellent. The ribs were tender and the sauce on the ribs very good. The ravioli heaven. The only thing that was average were Â the fish tacos. The tacos were a little cold and for blackened fish they did not have much flavor but did appear blackened. The strawberry Moscow Mule was good. The server was pleasant but didn't inform us of specials. We had to ask her many many question. The food came out fast and hot except the tacos. I Â would return only on Sunday for specials.

Ambience- pretty decent! It's spacious and has a really nice little rooftop patio thing. The tables were big, didn't feel overcrowded at any point! 

Drinks- the drinks were decent. Got pitchers of mules which were delicious but expensive. This is where the comparison comes in- compared to other places in Back Bay- NOT that bad!

After about 35 minutes I went up to see where we were and hostess said probably another 20-35 minutes, ugh. We waited, then in about 1 hour we got called up but then had to wait another 20-25 minutes to get seated. They need a better system. Good news and reason for the 4 stars is that the food was amazing. Had the Filet tenderloin and wife had Mother Earth bowl with salmon, both were amazing!

Â Had a quick 1 night in Boston when the city still had lots of covid restrictions and I was thrilled to be able to make a late night dinner reservation at 10:30pm on a Thursday. Â When we arrived in the mall the downstairs area of Earls was empty and a sign directed us upstairs. Â I was so worried (and hungry) thinking the restaurant wouldnt seat us and they were closing. Â Well was I wrong! Â We went upstairs (total Vegas restaurant vibe) and this place was hopping! Â  This restaurant is absolutely HUGE! Â So many seating options- tables, bar, high tops and even semi outdoors. Â The desk had my reservation & seated us immediately. Â Covid restrictions limited our visit to 90 mins, but since food & drink came out so quickly we enjoyed multiple drinks and a meal. Â My hubby & I loved each hand crafted cocktail we had, my veggie sushi was good, and my husband loved his steak. Â Best of all was the club like music, live plants, , cozy couch benches & privacy walls between tables. Â Next time I am in Boston I will def come here again. Â Huge menu & such great cocktails & atmosphere. Â Thanks Earls for the late night dinner option!"

We had the steak and sushi and while the sushi was great, the steak was too chewy for us and we had to return it, but this is to no fault of the bartender or really even the kitchen, it just wasn't a great cut.

83,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,6/15/2020,"I used to come to Earls often for drinks with friends. Great patio and honestly the drinks never disappoint. 

The food however always seems to fall short. I've tried ordering the chicken tacos twice now and every time I do they are really just filled with cabbage and tomatoes, barely any chicken, the flavors are good from the jalapeÃ±o cream, but still extremely underwhelming. 

And same with trying the California burger. The burger was just okay, I felt the avocado was really missing as was the sriracha mayo, making it just very average. Definitely not bad but has potential to be so much better."

Two Caesar salads, two burgers, and some fries is not a huge sampling of the menu, but everything was cooked perfectly, tasted great, and made us want more. 

Service was awesome, sadly don't recall the waitresses' name, but made us comfortable and was engaging beginning to end. 

Interior is great too. Loved the layout and decor. Will be back for sure."
85,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,11/13/2020,"The atmosphere is amazing on Earl's rooftop, but unfortunately, the rest of the experience was just average. Reservations were completely booked up, but when we arrived, we were able to get a table in 20 minutes. They also validate parking.

We all ordered different dishes and all reported that the atmosphere was better than the food. Two of us ordered chicken, I ordered their plant based sushi, and one of us ordered a poke bowl. 

Service was particularly slow, as other reviewers noted. Our waitress was incredibly sweet, but it seemed like the kitchen was backed up based on the amount of time we waited for food/drinks. It seemed like the wait was out of her hands. Two of us asked for sides of sauce, and I asked for a side of rice; unfortunately, everyone else was basically done with their meals by the time the sides arrived. We didn't have napkins until about halfway through our meal. Not to mention, my boyfriend asked for a few ramekins of sauce and the kitchen said they have a limit on how many sauces are provided up front.... this caused our poor waitress to go back to the kitchen 3 times for sauce refills.

One of us ordered a refill drink twice because the first never came, and then both refills came out at once. Two of us ordered fruit margaritas, which were average and pretty overpriced.

You are definitely paying for the rooftop experience and location! A bit disappointing, but I probably wouldn't come again."
86,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,9/27/2021,"I was close to giving a 3-star but that would be unfair to the service and the overall ambiance of the restaurant. Instead I will start off with the negatives: 

The food is extremely overpriced and you are exclusively paying for the location/venue. I say this because the food is average-to-below-average and it is very very pricey. 

The quality of food felt very chain-esque. Our margaritas were below-average as you could just taste the sweet, tart margarita mix they used. 

The service was great as our waiter was nice, quick, and checked in on us. We even got an additional staff to check on us just to see how everything was going.

The venue is great and it is definitely a must-try for drinks (if getting a basic cocktail or beer, don't bother with margarita or specialty drinks). 

The service and vibes are what kept this review from being a 3-star"
87,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,6/22/2021,I stopped in with a friend for a drinks and appetizers. We were thrilled with AJs service. The manager Cody stopped by to check on the service and we were happy to report that everything arrived Â on time and as expected. The ambiance and lighting make for a great dinner atmosphere. This restaurant does not feel like a large chain restaurant at all. I was excited to see they have added espresso martinis to their drink menu. YUM! Sometimes they even have a Dj on premises. Be sure to ask about their specialty cocktails and the truffle fries are a must.

There is no reservations, walk in only. When we arrived there was a line but I didn't mind! We waited about 15 min and were able to snag a table.

First glance at the menu it's predominately seafood based. Makes sense. But meatballs were listed as an app! When our waiter came over we ordered some garlic bread to start and I inquired about the meatballs. He was honest and said ""you don't want that"" so I scrapped that idea and settled for linguine with calamari. My bf got the linguine with shrimp. 

The garlic bread was SO garlicky in the best possible way. It was simple and yet so tasty. I recommend saving a few pieces to dip into your past sauce.

Now my main dish I was really disappointed by. The calamari was all clumped together and very chewy. It also tasted SUPER fishy. I drowned it in some fresh cheese and ate it because I felt bad sending it back. Now my boyfriends dish? SO good. A great balance of flavors and the shrimp was perfectly cooked.

I'd come back for sure but maybe get something else. I do highly recommend the garlic bread and that linguine with shrimp!"
1,Giacomo's,3 star rating,12/22/2021,"To be honest, I'm not sure what the hype is all about. Ordered the bruschetta as well as lobster ravioli.

The bruschetta was pretty good, but nothing special in my opinion. Nothing unique but also nothing bad about it.

The lobster ravioli is what this place seems to be known for so we ordered it! First, there's only 8 pieces of ravioli that come with it and second, the taste of the ravioli is pretty bland. The sauce (or more like soup) the ravioli is in was pretty tasty but wish it was a thicker and creamy consistently.

Overall, not the worst Italian place but I wouldn't say it was any better than your regular Olive Garden?"
2,Giacomo's,5 star rating,12/8/2021,"Wonderful restaurant. We were wandering around little Italy and could see all the people eating in the window. Food looked great so we decided to put our name in and the line was short.
So glad we did. 
We got the grilled octopus appetizer, the lobster, clams and mussels over linguine, and the twin steamed lobsters.
Everything was great. The grilled octopus was tender and had a great flavor.
For the lobster, clams and mussels we had the half spicy, half regular sauce and it was wonderful. 
The twin lobsters were ridiculous. Two huge lobsters with butter. 
Waitress was really great, but food was just amazing."
3,Giacomo's,5 star rating,2/5/2022,"A two location restaurant in Boston, one in Back Bay and one in North End. We love the one in Back Bay because of its family oriented/style. In any event, both places serve delicious food. See pictures."
4,Giacomo's,5 star rating,4/1/2022,"If I could eat one pasta dish for the rest of my life, I think Giacomo's lobster, clam, scallop linguini would be it. I came here last weekend while family friends were in town. They were avid fans of Giacomo's in north end, and said this is the only Italian restaurant they go to in Boston. We went to the south end location, which was not that busy when we walked in around 5, but turned very lively around 6 for dinner rezzys. The service was phenomenal -- from the waiters and servers to the managerial staff -- and I would come back in a heartbeat. Would highly recommend the pasta special for two (it can actually feed 3-4), the calamari, chocolate ice cream, and tiramisu."

7,Giacomo's,4 star rating,9/27/2021,"WHEN: Friday @ 7:30pm 

TIP: there are 2 Giacomo's locations. Back Bay and little Italy (North end) 
Don't get these 2 locations mixed up. My party did and my bf ended up at the north end location, and taking the T back to the back bay location where my party was waiting for a table. 
CASH ONLY!! 

Giocomo don't seat the party until all party has arrived!! 

We waited for the last person of my party to arrive, which was my bf. He ended up being 1hr late. Although after he arrived, the host provided us a very nice outdoor table towards the end of the restaurant where it was quiet for a dinner chat. I'm so thankfully we didn't get seated inside. It was loud af. 

WHAT WE ORDERED 
Calamari $12 
Caesar salads $10
Shrimp and scallops linguine with Giacomo's sauce $19 
Scallops linguine with pesto $20
Mussels and clams linguine with fra diavolo sauce $19
Prosciutto and peas in a garlic cream sauce fettuccini $17 Â 
Lobster ravioli $20 
Their signature ravioli, this is a must when you're at giocomo 

Our total came out to be $145, which was a very reasonable price for a party of 4. We came from california, we would not be able to get this much food in CA with the price. We were thrilled with the quantity and quality of Italian food. I highly recommend giocomo to visitors in Boston."
8,Giacomo's,2 star rating,11/3/2021,"I had high hopes for this place because a couple of my friends recommended this place. 

-1 for the parking, I'm sorry but there is literally no where to park... and their value parking is 15 even on a week night.., like why? 

-1 I'm not sure if it was the owner or host but he gave off the vibe like the restaurant didn't need our business. The service was ok. 

My cousins linguini calamari and mussel pasta was quite good. 

-1 Sadly I didn't like my butternut squash ravioli... I thought it would be better. It was creamy tho. 

I think I've had better Italian food. Sorry"
9,Giacomo's,5 star rating,8/29/2021,"Debating on where we should celebrate the birthday girl, I came across this place after reading many amazing Yelp reviews. And thank you all, because this place was amazing. 

The little Italy of Boston, north end, was way too crowded and difficult to find parking. So I tried to steer away from the crowd hoping that we don't have to wait to long to dine. It seems like they accept reservations since a few people came in stating they had reservations. After half an hour wait on a rainy Saturday around 7 pm, we finally got seated. They were so packed that they were cramming three people in a two people table. It's ok, it's totally worth it, covid is history for this place. 

We ordered the lobster ravioli and zuppa de pesce (dinner for two). Amazing. Totally worth its value and the seafood was so fresh. The sauce they recommended was amazing as well. My favorite is definitely the lobster ravioli. The white sauce with it is like crack where it makes you want more and more. I literally took the bread to dip into the sauce, yeah it was that good. 

Oh and btw they're so busy, no time for questions or to write your name down. So make sure you announce yourself to let them know you're waiting and for how many people. the NYC side of me kicked in so we were able to secure a table :) . Just kidding, just make sure you make yourself known. 

Cash only or Venmo!"
10,Giacomo's,3 star rating,7/30/2021,"I heard so many good things about Giacomo's. After living in Boston for almost 6 years, I finally decided to try it. I came for an early dinner so there wasn't a wait. I ordered the linguine with mussels and clams with scampi sauce. 

The pasta and sauce were great but the seafood had sand in it... at least that's what I'm assuming it was. I felt this gritty sandy texture when I bit into the seafood (I think it was mostly from the clams, but it could've been the mussels too... not entirely sure). This kind of ruined the dish for me to be honest.

Overall, I don't know if this place is worth all the hype. I mean the food and service were fine (minus the sand in my dish, which other Yelpers have also pointed out), but it wasn't anything extraordinary. Maybe my expectations were too high. I might give them another chance and order something without seafood if I ever come back.

FYI They are cash only."
11,Giacomo's,5 star rating,7/9/2021,"Wow just wow. This was an amazing dinner to end our night in Boston. Everything was so delicious. I swear you can order anything on the menu and its just going to taste amazing. 

At first when we arrived, there were no more outdoor seatings so we were seated inside then it was kinda warm inside so we asked if we could sit outside instead and luckily a table open up and we were able to relocate with no issue. The weather was nice on our last day and not chilly like it was the first few days of our stay so we were able to enjoy the weather.

We both got pasta and it was freaking delicious! I tried the fracomo sauce and I cannot get enough of it. It had a hint of spicy and I was freaking loving it. I want some of that sauce back home now but this place is a must and so worth."
12,Giacomo's,4 star rating,1/29/2022,"A great place for seafood in the South End. The service is great and the food is good. This is a solid place, but I'm sorry I wasn't blown away by anything. If you're a seafood lover then you'll probably like this place more than I did..."
13,Giacomo's,1 star rating,9/27/2021,"I ordered doordash. Pasta and a house salad.
Pasta is plentiful and tasting great. But what on earth is up with this ""house salad"". It's spring mix and a side of dressing. I never ever complain at restaurants, I'm in the service industry, I'm not trying to be a Karen, but seriously what's up with the bowl of lettuce for SEVEN DOLLARS. There were no modifications to remove toppings, you order as-is. Hopefully this was a fluke. Otherwise buyer beware I guess."
14,Giacomo's,4 star rating,4/2/2022,"Our meal and our waitress Donna were awesome even though our appetizer came out after the entrees Â Just don't walk downstairs to use the rest rooms before you eat because they will scare the sh@t out of you.

15,Giacomo's,1 star rating,8/29/2021,"Great food, bad service.

We have been coming to Giacomo's for years and the food and service is always great. However, this recent visit left us disgusted. From the moment we stepped into line, we sensed a hostility between the wait staff, specifically instigated by a women who, in less kinder words, had the Karen blonde bob. She was incredibly disrespectful, belittling her fellow coworkers in front of all the restaurant customers. From yelling at them to leave tables alone and stating ""I told you to leave it! What are you doing,"" she raised her voice numerous times causing many heads to turn towards her direction. 

After we were seated and got ready to order we waved hi to her in order to get her attention. She immediately snapped back at us stating ""be patient! wait your turn"" with hostility and attitude. After that encounter our table of 3 was in disbelief in the level of disrespect that we experienced. Never in our lives had a server overtly treated her coworkers and customers so poorly with an audience. 

After that encounter, we lost our appetite and did not want to stay any longer near her presence. We left immediately still reeling over what happened.

The management needs to prioritize customers and not keep an employee who is so incredibly dismissive and rude to everyone around her."
16,Giacomo's,1 star rating,12/24/2021,"Alert: Avoid as much as possible. they don't want / appreciate your business. They probably consider you to be another annoying tourist that makes their life miserable by dining in.

Tried to go in on Christmas Eve but came a little bit early I guess (around 5pm). the moment we opened the door the old lady sighed ""ughhh"" (so loud and obviously pointed at us) like they don't want any customers (the restaurant seemed pretty full that time so it's not that they were resting or anything) 
Why would I want to do business with them if they don't want any diners because it's extra work load for them? If they don't want business that's fine, we are not gonna dine in thanks. We stepped out the moment the lady sighed so loudly. Why would we wanna pay any penny for unappreciative brat?"
17,Giacomo's,4 star rating,7/18/2021,"5 star food, 2 star service. 
Food is amazing. You choose from several amazing sauces, then pick your seafood and it all comes on linguine. It is the epitome of ""one thing done extremely well."" So tasty. 

The service is very much in the vein of ""you should be thanking US for allowing you in the restaurant."" You wait outside, which is fine, but it's just constant attitude from the servers that you are a nuisance. When ordering meals, one party member ordered calamari as his meal (wasn't very hungry) and the waitress said ""okay, but it's gonna come out first, you know."" Â No offer to have it come out with the meals. Very much just ""you get what you get."" Â The waitress took my empty wine glass without saying anything. I had to say, ""oh hey, actually can I get a second glass of Chianti?""

So. Good food. Service is my very least favorite kind. Not even ""bad"" really, just very rushed and pompous."
18,Giacomo's,5 star rating,2/8/2021,"Found this wonderful small neighborhood restaurant a few minutes walk from the Marriott Copley Place hotel. Got there early on a Monday night so no trouble getting a table...all the staff were very friendly and professional. Very nice and affordable menu selections. I asked the waitress for recommendations and she named a few then said they also had a pasta special...lobster and shrimp over homemade fusilli with a choice of a number of sauces. Being a pesto lover I chose that.

The food arrived within minutes...and it was magnificent. At least 6 jumbo shrimp and 10 lobster clawsl. The sauce was amazing and I struggled to finish it...a large portion indeed.

Highly recommend Giacomo's if your in the Back Bay/South Boston area!"
19,Giacomo's,5 star rating,6/21/2020,"TLDR: wonderful Italian food with a seafood focus. Not sure if it's always cash/Venmo only or just a quarantine thing. 

Broke my quarantine with their outdoor seating. Tables were all spaced apart more than 6 feet. Our waiter wore a mask and gave us plenty of space. The calamari was freshly fried and I love that they had fried peppers in it as well. I got the clam and musssels linguine in their giacomo sauce while my wife got the veal. Overall a great meal."
20,Giacomo's,4 star rating,7/26/2021,"I was heading to Mass for a wedding and decided to stop in Boston for the day with a group of people. While looking at restaurants, I came across Giacomo's so I proceeded to ask my cousin, who lives there about the restaurant. She explained to me that the food was worth the wait that we would experience so we decided to give it a go. 
 
 PARKING- Parking downtown Boston is like parking in every major city. You look for the nearest parking garage and walk. If you're looking to make your life easier and don't mind paying possibly a few dollars more, I would highly suggest Uber/Lyft/taxi.

SERVICE - The service we had is the reason this restaurant didn't get a 5-star rating. The waitress was extremely rude and short with us. She didn't seem to have any time for questions and came off as we were a nuisance that we didn't have our order ready the minute we sat down although we told her we had never been there before.

MENU - The menu has a good selection of Italian food. If you like Italian food, you will find something you like here.

FOOD/DRINKS - We ordered two glasses of wine and a beer. The selection was good and was easy for us to select something we liked.

For appetizers, we ordered mussels, calamari, and fried mozz. The mussels and fried mozz were very good but we never got the calamari. After the apps came, we tried getting the attention of multiple staff members who advised they would let our waitress know but the message was never delivered. Although they didn't forget to put it on the bill. Not getting the calamari was a bit disappointing but it is what it is.

For dinner two of us got the Frutti di mare on the menu and two of us got a Frutti di mare special. The food was fantastic and the sauce was arguably the best fra Diavolo sauce I have ever gotten at an Italian restaurant. The ONLY thing I wish they did was make homemade pasta as that would have made this restaurant probably the best Italian restaurant I have ever eaten at.
 
 PRICES - The prices we fair and the portions were good.

OVERALL - The only complaint we had was service. But I would still highly recommend this place and if we were ever in the area, we would still return. Restaurant deserves 4.5/5 stars but Yelp doesn't allow .5 stars.

Just a side note, the restaurant is small so the wait is going to take a bit. We waited about 90 minutes and would wait again for it. However, we went to dinner at primetime (7 pm). If you don't want to wait, I was told to go at the opening in the afternoon or for an earlier dinner (less wait)."
21,Giacomo's,5 star rating,6/3/2020,"All time favorite Italian restaurant in Boston! Seafood is extremely fresh and the sauces are to die for. My go-to is always the Fra Diavolo sauce. 

Things to order:
Frutti di Mare
Shrimp & Scallops
FRIED CALAMARI APPETIZER!!!
Lobster Ravioli

*Bonus: this location accepts reservations"
22,Giacomo's,4 star rating,12/8/2020,"As someone who never craves Italian food or pasta, their food is absolutely delicious. I heard SO much about Giacomo's from Bostoners so decided to give it a try. I ordered their Frutti di Mare in their fra diavolo sauce, Lobster Ravioli, and Goat cheese gnocchi (on their special menu) the two times I have been here. 

Their seafood is incredibly fresh and their portions are massive! I am SUPER picky about the texture of pasta but found it to be perfectly cooked. The flavors were so RICH, and there was just enough seasoning to give it a little kick instead of your generic marinara sauce. Also love that they didn't skimp out on the seafood in the Frutti di Mare - it was loaded with scallops, mussels, shrimp, squid, and clams. Â Given how big the plates are, I could have comfortably shared one of their pasta dishes and been satisfied. However, there are so many different pasta combinations here, it's hard to share since I want to try it all! I still haven't tried any of their cream-based pasta sauces and would love to come back to try it (with my lactaid of course!!). 

The space is a bit cramped but still very cozy, and it's expected for most restaurants in this area. We didn't have to wait to get seated on a Sunday night, though they were about an hour from closing. I was a bit disappointed by the service however, we tried calling twice to see if there was space for us to dine-in but I got hung up on twice but we decided to drive over and see for ourselves. When we got there, it was super unclear on who to talk to to get a table, and service felt a bit cold but it might just be me... 

Also, CASH ONLY or they take Venmo (they will give you a code to scan). Kinda wish they would offer credit card in this day in age."
23,Giacomo's,5 star rating,7/28/2021,"Oh. My. Goodness. What an absolute delight. 

My dad and I stopped in after being recommended by a friend. We got there right at opening, and from the start the service was so authentic and nice. 

We decided to order the shared seafood pasta dish. Holy smokes, it did NOT disappoint. IT was PLENTY of food for the two of us, and the quality of the seafood itself was ON POINT! 

I also loved that the wine/beer was reasonably priced, and the desserts were big enough to share! 

I would 1000% recommend Giacomos!"

Sit at the bar by myself to enjoy a meal, guy beside me starting to talk to me and decide to attack my Japanese heritage. 
Shocked, insulted and absolutely horrified, I started to cry as people at the restaurant did absolutely nothing. 
Racists at the best. I will never ever go back and will be absolutely traumatized forever."

26,Giacomo's,5 star rating,2/1/2021,"NOTE: Giacomo's is still cash only during the pandemic so make sure you have some!!!
Stopped into Giacomo's after an 8 hour train ride into Boston and was in desperate need of food. I was not disappointed! HUGE portions for reasonable price and TONS of seafood in the linguine with calamari and mussels I ordered. 
The people with me ordered a large Caesar (huge portion and was great! I loved the dressing and the croutons and 10$ for a huge one!) and the caprese (again very Big Bang for buck and fresh and delicious.) 
I ordered the linguine with calamari and mussels and scampi sauce (you pick your pasta, the seafood(s) combo you want, and the sauce you want with it so easy to customize!) and it was DELICIOUS! So much calamari and mussels plus the scampi was absolutely delicious. If anything, I almost wish there were more noodles! If you were splitting with someone, you could definitely get a Caesar and one pasta dish and leave satisfied.
We also all tried a different wine and enjoyed them all. I got a Riesling, and my friends for a Pinot noir and a Cabernet Franc.
Overall, a great spot, great portions, great for groups of 4 (that seemed to be the largest table they had right now) and still offering indoor dining! Would recommend if you're looking for a good, hearty pasta dish!"

31,Giacomo's,5 star rating,9/27/2020,"Among the restaurants I ate in Boston during Labor Day Weekend 2020, Giacomo's in North End definitely ranks on top as one of my favorites! 

We decided to go for an early lunch/brunch on Saturday morning and was delighted by the available outdoor seating. The restaurant was able to space out a fair amount of dining tables on the sidewalk and street just outside the restaurant. Many restaurants during this time have limited seating outside, but Giacomo's has two long rows of seating that start directly outside its entrance, extending outward to the left of the restaurant (facing away from its entrance). We were able to pick our dining table and sit comfortably distanced from all others!

The food was top notch! I still remember how tasty and crunchy their calamari was. The deep fried starter was served along with fried bell peppers and sweet peppers, which are perfect complements to the calamari. The lobster ravioli was simply amazing. The sauce had a perfect amount of creaminess and cheesiness and was a perfect size to share for two!

I was quite impressed by the quickness of service at Giacomo's during this unprecedented time. I highly recommend visiting during weekend lunch hours!"
32,Giacomo's,5 star rating,8/7/2021,"Ate here after first going to the Giacomo's in the North End - there was no wait, the food was equally good (if not better), and the portions were significantly larger. The service was also much friendlier and there was much more space to eat. Would very much recommend coming here (especially over the other Giacomo's in the North End).

Quick note: they only take cash (no card!) which was not made clear to us until we got our bill. It wasn't an issue because somebody from our party just ran to an ATM, but something to keep in mind before dining here."
33,Giacomo's,5 star rating,2/26/2020,"Great pasta and seafood place! Huge portions and everything we had was delicious. I think the original one is on the North End but judging by the reviews and pictures of both places they look equally as good. 

No wait at 630 on a Wednesday. Got full by 730. The wait staff was really nice and I think the owner/manager greeted us at the door. They brought soft yummy bread right to our table when we sat down which was great since we were starving. And brought waters right away too. 

The dishes are reasonably priced for the amount of food they give. 17 dollars for the linguine and scallop dish I ordered. Probably about 1lb of pasta and 10 scallops! Huge! My boyfriend got the tuna and swordfish fettuccine in a pesto sauce. The pesto sauce was sooo good and creamy. I liked it better than the sauce I had. Which was supposed to be a tomato and lobster cream sauce but it just tasted like tomato sauce. The swordfish (and the tuna- but I really liked the swordfish) was cooked so well and really paired better than I expected with the pesto sauce. 

We were contemplating getting the 65 dollar meal for 2 but that is pretty expensive. We saw it come out and it was like 4 servings. We wouldn't have been able to finish it and to share it with more than 2 they charge you an extra 10 dollars a plate. We got 2 huge delicious dishes for 34 total on their regular menu and that was plenty. 

The Tiramisu for dessert was amazing. The mascarpone cream was light and fluffy and a little cheesy and a lot delicious. Bold coffee flavor and great consistency with the moist cake. I had tiramisu in Italy and this was better!

Cash only too btw. 

Loved our experience here. Next time I am in Boston I will definitely come back again!"
34,Giacomo's,4 star rating,5/18/2021,"Okay Italian for okay prices. The portions are huge and you'll most likely bring some leftovers home. The South End location will take reservations for large parties which is nice and now with COVID, they accept Venmo!"
35,Giacomo's,5 star rating,1/8/2020,"I came looking for superb Italian food, and that's exactly what I got. From the excellent food to the wonderful service, it's everything a foodie's looking for when trying a new restaurant. 

We waited roughly an hour on a weekday, as to be expected. We were seated at the counter where we had a great view of the kitchen. We ordered the lobster ravioli and chicken parmesan. 

It has a very intimate ambiance. From looking around, customers were having a great time - many knew the employees even. It was a blast to see the Italians joke around, I'd known I came to the right place. 

Our food arrived and I dug into my ravioli. The richness of the sauce with the beautiful texture of pasta and lobster danced on my tongue. It was a little salty, but I'd much prefer it to be a little more than bland. I tried the chicken parmesan and it was fantastic as well. It was so good that I was scraping the marina sauce off the plate with my fork. It took some willpower to not lick the plate clean.

For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu. And the tiramisu alone would deserve this restaurant five stars. It was beautiful. The best tiramisu I've ever had! To this day, I still crave that slice. If I return to Boston, this might be the restaurant I'll visit first."
36,Giacomo's,3 star rating,10/10/2021,"There's nothing really special about this place, considering the numerous other Italian options nearby. 
1) It's cash only - why is this still a thing in 2021?
2) There is no sound dampening/acoustic panels in this place. It gets incredibly loud, the four of us were literally yelling at each other throughout the whole dinner. 
3) Food was decent, I wouldn't come back for it. And if you're going to serve bread, at least serve it warm. No one likes cold stale bread. It also doesn't come with any dips (there is a bottle of olive oil on the table but it's not very good)."
37,Giacomo's,5 star rating,10/16/2021,"First of all I love the south end. The atmosphere and area is awesome. We were walking and bumped into this restaurant. They took us in right away. We got there at the right time as it got full 15 minutes later. Â The service and the food was amazing. Very attentive, friendly and enjoyable. True authentic Italian. The chicken Picatta was delicious, the Cesar salad was creamy with toasted fresh out of the oven Croutons. I highly recommend this restaurant."
38,Giacomo's,4 star rating,10/9/2019,"This is a really traditional Italian restaurant specializing in pasta dishes. Note that this place is in fact cash only and unlike their location in North End, you can book a reservation ahead of time!

We had the Lobster Ravioli, Frutti di Mare, and Fettuccine with Salmon and Sun-dried Tomatoes. The portion of raviolis that was given looked to be pretty small compared to other dishes, but it'll definitely fill you up because of how heavy the delicious garlic white sauce is. The Frutti di Mare pasta with Giacomo sauce was very good as well - the seafood had very good flavor and the Fettuccine dish was also very delicious - lots of tomato flavor. Overall, the food was delicious and the portion size was on the perfect-larger size, and the prices for the food was very fair.

Highly recommend this place!!"

We had fried mozzarella, fried calamari, Linguine with shrimp and scallops with Fracomo sauce, and Linguine with frutti di mare and fracomo sauce. All solid but not mind blowing...would be much better if the pasta was homemade."
41,Giacomo's,4 star rating,2/12/2020,"Have been to both Giacomos, this current location in the South End and their main location in the North End. Usually go to the one in the South End as it is more accessible to me, takes reservations, and the wait is a lot shorter (main location you will probably wait on average for 2 hours). Though I would say the North End one is noticeably better and would recommend going to that one at least one.

Onward to the food review. I usually order a plate of Calamari and their signature Frutti Di Mare with the Giacomo sauce. The calamari is delicious and pretty fresh seafood. Though it can be a hit or miss in terms of portion. Sometimes we get a lot, sometimes we get minuscule amounts. The Frutti Di Mare is one of if not the best Italian pasta dish I have had and it has a delicious sauce that goes along with it. It comes with a generous amount of seafood ranging from shrimps, scallops, clams, etc and a good-sized amount of linguine for its price. It is a pretty big portion that you will probably only finish half of it so you can have the rest some other day.

If you are around the Prudential or South End area, I would recommend giving this place a try if you want authentic, high quality Italian food."

44,Giacomo's,5 star rating,9/26/2021,"Another gem in the middle of a quiet neighborhood near our hotel. My family and I really enjoyed it. Had the Fruti di mare. Large serving that could feed two people. Very fresh and the seafood was not over cooked. Also, very good prices for the quality and portions."
45,Giacomo's,5 star rating,6/25/2021,"First tip about this place I'd they do not take credit cards so you pay cash or Venmo. 
I went there with my family around 6 pm on a Friday night. Â The place was mostly empty so we were worried that it met not be as good as the little Italy location. 
It is not busy like that location at little Italy but the food and service is just as good. Â You have option of indoor or outdoors. Â 
The waiter was as very nice. Menu offers many options. Authentic Italian. Â food with options of combination of sauces and create your own pasta. The giacomo sauce is excellent and you can get diavolo spice sauce or combine Giacomo and diavolo sauce called Fracomo which excellent with shrimp and scallops. Â The shrimp large size. The chicken parmigiana is amazing with juicy chicken breast and breading crispy on the outside. The tomato sauce tangy. The chicken peppers and onions in tomato cream sauce was amazing with nice combination the yellow and red peppers give it a great sweetness. There are so many other dishes I wanted to try but may be garlic chicken in broccoli it will be on my list near time. Â If you liked the Giacomo little Italy location food but do not want the wait, this place will deliver!!"

47,Giacomo's,5 star rating,6/10/2019,"***Cash only.
Delicious food + large portion + good price.
Fried calamari was really good - they had some fried pepper in it.
Frutti Di Mare was recommended with the giacomo sauce (house sauce) - lobster base red sauce but creamy. Came with lots sauce so didn't have to end up with dry noodle as we ate, and the sauce is definitely good! Generous amount of seafood as well. 
As their linguini can come with a few different sauces, definitely want to go back and try something other than the giacomo. 
Also like the lobster ravioli which is creamy and rich."
48,Giacomo's,4 star rating,8/7/2019,"My family and I are here recently when we were in Boston. It's a small place with seating for about 30 people. There can be a line at the door waiting for tables to leave. The staff clears tables immediately so it's usually a short wait. The waiters are friendly. 

We started with an order of calamari and they brought fresh bread. The breading on the calamari was light but didn't have much seasoning.

My husband had the Eggplant Parmesan with penne and the tomato sauce made with San marzano tomatoes. It was better than other places because is wasn't soggy but he thought there could have been more seasoning in the sauce. He likes things really herby.

My son had lasagna special which was made with beef and sausage. He enjoyed it but could only eat half. That says a lot for a growing teen.

I had the scallops risotto which was cooked very well. I just wish there was more of it. When we walked in a saw someone in the window they had a big bowl of pasta. 

Overall, great experience with linen table clothes. Also they were the only restaurant in the week we were in Boston that served ice in their water! I guess we're spoiled I'm VA."
49,Giacomo's,5 star rating,7/20/2021,Stumbled upon this place after shopping all day on Newbury st. My boyfriend came up from Virginia to try lobster for the first time and was not disappointed. Great price for great food.
50,Giacomo's,5 star rating,12/19/2020,"Giacomo's, a warm spot on a cold night. We were lucky enough to be seated quickly in the newly renovated upstairs area. The view out the window was straight out of a movie. We were greeted quickly. Deena and the other server worked together to give us the best service. Her recommendation of the cÃ¡ptese for an appetizer was spot on. The addition of the charred red bell peppers were a nice spin from the traditional style. My lobster ravioli was definitely the star of the entrees, although all dishes were fantastic. 

Y'all are amazing. Keep pushing thru this pandemic. See you next time!"
51,Giacomo's,4 star rating,1/1/2022,Very good for the price paid! I got a clam and mussels pasta dish with the Giacomos sauce which was very good and came hot. The bread they gave was a heart crusted Italian not sliced but still very appreciated.

A little weird to me that I haven't reviewed what is essentially my favorite restaurant in Boston. And yes - I've been to the Giacomo's at the North End as well. But I prefer the one in the South End - taste is similar but the best part? YOU CAN MAKE RESERVATIONS! Whether you get seated right at your reservation or not is a different story, however. That can be a hit or a miss - we've sometimes had to wait an extra 30 minutes even with a reservation. When they get slammed, they really do get slammed. But, nevertheless, this is the place I love taking any visitors to Boston to. 

The food is just AWESOME here. I've never taken anyone here who has not been pleased with it. 

Some of my favorite dishes:
-Butternut Squash Ravioli
-Lobster Ravioli
-Squid Ink Pasta dish (haven't seen it available recently)
-Zuppa Di Pesce w/ Fracomo sauce

There's lots of things on the menu and quite honestly, I don't remember everything I've had here. I've been coming here for YEARS and I've picked out my favorites that I always come back for. But I will say, I've never really had anything here that was bad. I will say that I've never been able to finish the Zuppa Di Pesce here. Whether it's with a group of 6 or 4 or just 2 of us, ordering that dish guarantees you leftovers. 

And yes - you can't stand in the foyer. Yes, it's cold outside, but that's also a fire hazard. Â 

I believe they also offer valet parking here ($15) - but there's also a nearby garage that offers $10 parking after 5PM that's a short walk away."
53,Giacomo's,5 star rating,8/14/2021,"Best best best burrata I've ever had. It a generous portion: came with fresh sliced tomatoes, very fragrant basil, and tons of prosciutto. The moment I poked the burrata with my fork I knew it was going to be a delicious one. Fresh and creamy burrata, tasted like they just made it today. The bread was amazing too. Highly recommended!"
54,Giacomo's,5 star rating,2/1/2021,Went here with my girlfriend for date night last night and we got the salmon fettuccine and the tuna and swordfish fettuccine dishes! They had some clear banner barriers between some of the tables and the tables were pretty well spaced. Good service! Good food! Great portions! I'm someone who can EAT and I was pretty satisfied after the meal...my girlfriend finished maybe half of her pasta
55,Giacomo's,3 star rating,9/8/2021,Most money I've ever spent on pasta! Their portions were large so I suggest two people could share 1 entree
56,Giacomo's,5 star rating,5/15/2020,"Giacomo's is my favorite restaurant in the world. I have had 3 birthday dinners there over the past 7 years. Every time someone visits me in Boston, I take them to Giacomo's. On my last night in Boston, I ordered take-out from Giacomo's (see attached photos). My favorite dishes are:

1) Butternut squash ravioli.

2) Homemade fusilli with fra diavolo sauce and seafood. The amount of seafood they put on the plate is very generous.

Their calamari, garlic bread, and burrata appetizer are also fantastic. Giacomo's has very reasonably priced bottles of wine ($20-25! for the whole bottle!). I will dearly miss Giacomo's when I move.

I will also add that Giacomo's is doing a great job with their takeout service during the coronavirus pandemic. I ordered my food for takeout at a particular time. It was ready when I showed up, and was kept hot under heating lamps. The dishes were nicely garnished, tasted EXACTLY like I remembered when I ordered in a restaurant, and generously-priced/portioned as always. They even packed me bread!"
57,Giacomo's,5 star rating,2/27/2021,"Always a great experience at Giacomo's!!! The food is stellar, do not miss out on the Giacomo sauce on whatever pasta dish you get.

58,Giacomo's,5 star rating,8/7/2021,"I was looking for a good place for Italian on a Saturday night in Boston, and the reviews pointed me to Giacomo's. Â I was originally looking at the Hanover street location but ultimately decided to come here instead (to try to avoid the mass herds of tourists) and it turned out to be a great decision.

It was definitely less crazy than the Little Italy location, but still busy early (around 6pm) on a Saturday evening. Service was great, prices were very reasonable, and the food was amazing. It's also worth mentioning that the food comes out piping hot and fresh quickly, so it's especially helpful when you're dining with kids.

The fried calamari was perfectly fried and tender. The Marinara sauce that it came with was also nice and flavorful. Â I had the linguini and claims with scampi sauce and I ate every last thing on my plate. The sauce was flavorful and they did not drown it in cream and came parmesan like a lot of the fake Italian restaurants do. Â My wife had the Lobster Ravioli in a light cream sauce and she seemed to enjoy it.

If you like eating at the Olive Garden this is probably not the place for you. But if you like fresh flavorful food this is a wonderful choice for excellent Italian food. This was my first Giacomo's experience and I will definitely be back next time I visit Boston."
59,Giacomo's,3 star rating,12/15/2021,"The food was good. Â The wait staff wore masks, but they wore them below their nose or below their mouth (only covering their chin), which made me a bit uneasy, especially with highly transmissible Omicron on the rise."
60,Giacomo's,5 star rating,3/6/2020,"Primary location is the way to do it. However, because it was so cold + bad timing, decided to come here tonight. Much more seating available with little to no wait time. Same menu as the famous location over on Hanover. This location definitely let's you ""chill"" vs. rushed service at other location. 

Went with calamari, fried mozz, garlic cheesy bread, chicken parm, pasta - all fantastic. Top notch service great wine pairings as well. Will be back!"
61,Giacomo's,2 star rating,4/7/2021,"Service was absolutely horrible 
Everything I ordered was not done right including no croutons on my caesar or no green basil or parsley on chicken parmigian because my kids would not eat it
I called upfront told them it was my girlfriend's birthday they never acknowledge it, when I finally asked for dessert with candle they brought tiramisu and charged me for it and didnt even clear the table so put tiramisu on dirty table full of dirty plates full of pasta and empty mussle shells
Seafood pasta was good but lobster was not fresh in the pasta and very very overcooked 
Chicken parmesagna was very good
Service totally sucked"
62,Giacomo's,3 star rating,5/31/2019,"This place is a very standard old school red sauce restaurant. The menu is quite limited but offers all Italian classics. The food was very okay, however this place must have a reputation because the line was out the door as it got later in the evening. 

Originally my friend and I were going to share an appetizer and a pasta, but they have a really annoying sharing policy where they charge an extra $10 for splitting a plate. I guess that's part of their ""old school charm."" So instead we ended up splitting two pasta dishes - the frutti di mare linguini and lobster ravioli. Both my friend and I enjoyed the seafood pasta more. We ordered the lobster ravioli with the Giacomo sauce, which is suppose to be their special red sauce mixed with cream, however it came off relatively one note to me. 

I'm sure there are people who enjoy classic style Italian restaurants, however I would much rather go somewhere like Eataly nearby where I can get more interesting dishes without annoying upcharges."

64,Giacomo's,5 star rating,3/13/2020,"I've lived in Boston for five years and often passed by Giacomo's (in the North End). However, I never ate there- I always thought of it as a tourist trap. I was severely mistaken!

Giacomo's is my new favorite restaurant- delicious food, huge portions, and super affordable! The only downside is that you'll probably have to wait for a table- but it's worth it.

The complimentary bread was good- pretty standard Italian bread. I had the garlic bread appetizer. It was the same bread as the appetizer, but drenched in garlic oil. I had looked at pictures on Yelp and thought the bread had cheese- sadly it did not. However, it was still definitely worth the $4. 

I ordered the lobster ravioli, based on the reviews. Lobster is my favorite food and I am very picky. The lobster ravioli was the best I've ever had. Eight plump ravioli, stuffed with fresh lobster meat. The sauce was creamy and delicious. Highly recommend!

For desert, I was torn between the chocolate truffle bomb and tiramisu. My friend ordered the chocolate truffle bomb and I tried it. The cake (part of the truffle bomb) was nothing special- standard chocolate cake. I ordered the tiramisu, and am very happy I did! The ladyfingers were soaked in liquor and the cake was super moist. 

Highly recommend!"
65,Giacomo's,5 star rating,6/17/2021,Great service! Great Food! Â Great atmosphere! Â I love the no frills approach to this place. The food speaks for itself.
66,Giacomo's,4 star rating,11/22/2021,"Really nice little spot, good ambiance, the service was good but not great. The calamari was good, could have been cut up a little more regularly but it was very tasty. I had the tuna and swordfish with pesto cream sauce over linguine, and it was excellent. My wife had the butternut squash ravioli and it was very sweet, almost too sweet. Overall I'd recommend this, the prices are also very reasonable for this area."
67,Giacomo's,2 star rating,7/3/2021,"I have to say I was disappointed. We spent $72 on takeout from this restaurant and the food wasn't great. My house salad was literally just lettuce. I didn't like my salad dressing and was left with a large amount of plain lettuce. The garlic bread was burnt. The Caesar salad had a total of four croutons in it. I also had a problem with the mozzarella sticks. They were lukewarm and had an unpleasant texture. They tasted very bland, even with the red sauce. All in all, I would say that for the price we paid I feel cheated."
68,Giacomo's,4 star rating,5/12/2019,"*cash only*

The portions are HUGE!! For the price, you cannot neat the portion size and quality. I love real Italian, & Giacomo's was awesome. The only reason I give them 4/5 stars is because the food could have been more flavorful, and the place was super smashed together. We were sitting next to another couple, and had to keep literally sliding our table over for them to go the bathroom. 

You get bread once you order, and it was delicious. The staff was awesome and very knowledgeable. Honestly, we could have probably spilt an entree, due to the size. 

My boyfriend ordered salmon fettuccine, & I had the shrimp language any with Giacomo sauce. 

The manager is very active and very kind. I am satisfied with Giacomo's, and will return."
69,Giacomo's,4 star rating,12/25/2019,"DINNER REVIEW

If you don't want to wait in the long lines in the North End for some authentic Italian food, Giacomo's is a great option in the heart of the amazing culinary neighborhood that is the South End.

The restaurant is small but very homey...you will likely be nudged up next to diners at different tables. If you do have to wait, Anchovies next door is a great dive bar.

We went on a Friday at 5:45 so we got seated immediately. We started with the Caesar Salad and Burrata (which was a special) both of which were fresh and tasty. I wouldn't say these are ""must gets"" but they are good.

What I would say is a must get is the pasta (as it should be no surprise, at an Italian restaurant). Per the recommendations of the waiter, I had the frutti di mare with fra diavola sauce. The pasta was chock full of beautiful mussels, clams, oysters, and more and the sauce was perfectly spicy. This sauce...WOW!

Key things to know: It's cash only and they take reservations, but otherwise the wait will be long."
70,Giacomo's,5 star rating,9/19/2020,"This is my favorite restaurant in Boston and I was so glad that they opened up (with precautions) during this pandemic. 
Lobster ravioli is a must try."
71,Giacomo's,5 star rating,4/20/2021,"On our recent trip to Boston last weekend we decided to spend our last dinner having Italian. Giacomo's was recommended by a friend who was also visiting Boston, and boy, did we make the right decision coming here! We started off with some calamari- tender and crispy served with a delicious marinara. Next we shared a lobster ravioli in garlic cream sauce and a frutti di mare with linguine fra diavolo style. The lobster raviolis had good amounts of lobster and the sauce was rich and decadent but not overwhelmingly so. The frutti di mare was pure perfection with an assortment of fresh seafood and a perfectly seasoned slightly spicy red sauce. To end the night, we tried the chocolate truffle cake. And my oh my was it tasty! One bite of the moist chocolate cake and creamy truffle along with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and we were in heaven. Sigh...Giacomo's made our trip to Boston a very memorable one with every dish that came out that night. The staff was also very friendly and courteous and the small neighborhood feel of this Italian restaurant set just the right tone for the evening. And the plus was if you didn't have cash on hand, you could easily Venmo them as well. Everything was well-thought out. Thank you, Giacomo's for making our visit truly memorable. We will be back for sure on our next visit to Boston!"
72,Giacomo's,5 star rating,7/1/2020,Delicious Italian food! The Bolognese tasted like it came from my Italian nana's kitchen. The pappardelle pasta was a special for the night but I would highly suggest it if that's an option. There is Â plenty of outdoor seating and the South End location is currently taking reservations- possibly due to COVID. Some street parking available if needed but pretty tough to find parking during peak hours. All in all- Â great food and service !
73,Giacomo's,5 star rating,6/15/2021,"We had the most delicious food during our first dinner in Boston at Giacomo's! We waited in line outside for about 15 minutes before being seated for a party of two. They gave us a table on the second floor, which was a beautiful indoor/outdoor area. Our waiter was extremely kind and friendly. We started with the mussels with the scampi sauce, which were so, so delicious, and they came with so many (even more than pictured--we had already eaten some). We also ordered the caesar salad, which was a bit too heavily dressed, but still good. The linguine with clams and fracomo sauce was delicious, but just had a lot of sauce and not too many clams. The linguine with shrimp and fra diavolo sauce was fantastic. The service was quick and everyone was super kind--they did feel a bit rushed at times, but they were all very attentive and made our time at Giacomo's memorable."
74,Giacomo's,5 star rating,11/24/2019,"Giacomos so good went tonight and no wait!! I'm thanking the weather for that :) I've always had amazing service here and always get the eggplant parm or chicken marsala, you can't go wrong with either dish.

75,Giacomo's,4 star rating,10/25/2019,"Food: 8/10
The calamari was mediocre. Wasn't very hot or crispy, seemed as if it wasn't freshly cooked? Not sure about that. However, pastas on the other hand were absolutely incredible. Perfectly cooked to al dente. Fresh and chewy, favorite place to come for some quality pasta.

Usually a wait so would recommend reserving a seat beforehand or calling to ask prior or try heading over 15-20 mins before they open at 5 pm so you don't have to wait as long.

TIP: $$ CASH ONLY $$
If you forget to bring some, there's an ATM down the street from the restaurant."
76,Giacomo's,4 star rating,2/3/2020,"Coworker was raving about this place, so we all decided to come for dinner on a Boston layover. The restaurant was small, but cozy and we were seated right away about an hour after opening on Sunday night. We were served bread with parmesan and olive oil to snack on while we reviewed the menu. I ordered the lobster ravioli, which seemed to be a popular dish. 
The portions here are pretty generous and the prices are fair. I enjoyed my meal and was pretty stuffed by the end. It is cash only, so be sure to have some on hand. The tiramisu looked amazing, so I will definitely have to save some room for that next time."

81,Giacomo's,2 star rating,8/30/2018,"Not sure why this restaurant has such high reviews. I found it just okay.

Visiting from Canada and went in on a Saturday evening. It was packed but luckily no real wait for next table. I think we waited like 5 minutes and were seated quickly. We were next to this local couple who mentioned this place is one of their favourites. Honestly, I am surprised it is. Given they mentioned sauce was a bit watery for one of their dishes when its suppose to be thicker.

I had a really abrasive server who gave me a bad impression that continued till the end of my evening. He wanted to give me the specials but would not say them while my friend was in the washroom. I said I could relay it to her but he would not talk to me until they were back. He also would offer to refill bread but never came to give it to us. At the end of our meal, as we were trying to pay with a tip for him he said no coins. Only bills. That topped it for me. I accept that it's a cash only place but to only do bills? Sorry but my tip reflected what I thought of that and his behaviour throughout my dining experience. 

Besides service, the food was subpar as well. I ordered the lobster ravioli. The filling was a dry lobster paste consistency and sauce was too watery. My friend had the mussel linguine and we both noticed the mussels were tiny. Like size of your thumb. I wasnt wowed by either dish. 

Overall, I would not recommend this place."

2) Very rude bus staff. 
3) $10 plate charge for Zuppa di

I got the lobster ravioli as my entree and it was stellar as always. The thing I love about Giacomos is despite the high quality of food, it's so affordable. A must have everytime I'm in Boston."

Definitely try to make a reservation before you go, as it can easily be at least an hour wait to get a table. My favorite here is the butternut squash ravioli, but the most recent time I visited here last Saturday we got the lobster ravioli and the scallops linguini with the fracomo sauce. Their flavors are on point and the fracomo sauce on the scallops linguini was amazing. I was debating between the fra diavolo or giacomo, so just went with fracomo. The fracomo sauce actually has a kick so if you can't do any spicy foods I would favor one of the other non-spicy sauces! Usually they are really good with the texture of the pasta (al dente), but the lobster ravioli this time was a bit too undercooked. If you go with someone to share, I would recommended getting a cream based pasta and a red sauce pasta to share!"

I'm fortunate that this place is down the street from me as the place can get really crazy come dinner time on the weekends. Â If you want to have a good shot at walking in to be seated then I would suggest the middle of a weekday!

Service the night we came here was prompt (Tuesday night) and fortunately it wasn't crowded to a point where one would have to shout for the other to hear which can be the case if you come in on a weekend for dinner. Â 

I went for the lobster ravioli which was quite good. Â The sauce was rich and creamy and there was a decent amount of lobster in each ravioli. Â The price is also quite reasonable for what you get. Â My partner enjoyed her Frutti di Mare as well (though she was disappointed they didn't let her combine the red and white sauce that night). Â The Caesar salad and calamari were quite fresh and delicious. Â No complaints there! Â So far the service and food have been quite consistent for us so we'll keep coming back! Â 

Do note that unless you have a South End permit residential sticker, parking can be annoying if you don't come early in the evening!"

The inside of the restaurant isn't that big, but the servers/kitchen operate efficiently and it looked like people weren't waiting long for their food. 

I ordered the pho dac biet, which was had rice noodles and different cuts of beef in a rich, flavorful broth. My friend ordered the honey chicken, but subbed tofu for the protein. Both of us loved our food. It was filling and tasted wonderful. The soups hit the spot in the colder, drearier months in Boston. 

The inside of the restaurant is cozy; I definitely think it would be a good place for a date. I'm usually pretty skeptical of Newbury Street restaurants, but Beantown Pho exceeded my expectations!"
1,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,2/27/2022,"This was my go to place for pho whenever I was on newbury! It's a small cute place right on newbury between all the stores to very convenient.

We visited recently and got the com or grilled pork with rice and the pho dac biet as well as the crispy rolls.

The crispy rolls was crispy and crunchy on the outside but was filled with delicious meat and veggies on the inside. Really like the nuoc mam that it came with.

The rice dish came with veggies, grilled pork and nuoc mam. The grilled pork was super tasty! I loved the flavor and char on it but the portions were small compared to all the veggies that were provided. Wished there was a bit more meat.

As for the pho dac biet that was very flavorful and rich as well. It came with a bunch of different meats and the noodles had a great texture.

Overall a great place for pho!!"
2,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,1/11/2022,"I ordered this with a friend after craving some Thai/viet food. The food was pretty good, especially compared to other places in Boston (still not as great as ones in the Bay Area). I would definitely come here again if I ever want Thai/viet food.

Curry Noodle 3/10 - I've been craving this dish for a while now which was why I ordered it. However, I was terribly disappointed. The curry used in this was way too sweet. The first few bites were delicious, but the sweetness made it a bit sickening to eat after a while. I would not recommend this dish.

Coconut Tom Yum Noodle Soup 8.5/10 - Although the curry noodle was disappointed, the coconut Tom yum noodle soup was amazing. I loved the broth as it was perfect blend of sour and sweet. I wish more noodles were given so I could've eaten more :)

Vietnamese Iced Coffee 10/10 - I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Vietnamese coffee. It tasted exactly how I wanted it. The coffee was rich and sweet with an underlying bitterness. It was so addicting to drink!!!"
3,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,4/6/2022,This place has very good thai takeout. The vibe inside was weird- I probably should have called ahead to order but I did not. The food was really good. I got a chicken noodle dish. It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was yummy and kept me full for the night! I wish there were more of the crunchy peanut things on it and more sauce.
4,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,2/26/2022,A New England winter snow storm and an exhausting work week are sufficient reasons to order UberEats on a Friday night. My sister ordered the Spicy Hofun Noodles and I ordered the Tom Yum Pad Thai. Both dishes were absolutely delectable! We made sure to tip extra since our UberEats driver had to travel in inclement weather conditions. The only downside was that with all the additional fees + tip this meal ended up costing about $60.
5,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,11/9/2021,"For a quick weekday lunch I stopped by Beantown Pho. Most of the establishment's seats looked occupied, and I managed to get one of the few remaining. One QR code scan to reveal the menu, an order with the waitress, and 5 minutes later, I received my order.

My lunch, the Mi Hoanh Thanh ($12), consisted of yellow egg noodles, pork and shrimp dumpling, fried shallots, sesame oil, and chicken broth. The dumplings tasted extra juicy and fresh. The egg noodles seemed mass-market, and the chicken broth seemed a bit too light, relying too heavily on the shallots and sesame oil.

Overall, this seemed like a fast, no-frills work lunch."
6,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,7/29/2021,"i was rec'd this place by a friend after i made it known that i was going through a pad thai phase. i've been here a few times now and the pad thai did not disappoint. i've even branched out to try the pad see ew and that was also delicious. additionally, i've tried their bubble tea and it's great. i love the cups that it comes in with the handle. i've since rec'd this place to other friends and out of town visitors and they all love it

one of the things that consistently amazes me about this place is how the staff is so adept at memorizing your orders. i usually come with 2 or 3 other people and their orders aren't as easy as mine. and then add in drinks. after everyone states their orders, the staff repeats everyone's orders back to you, perfect each time

the food comes out steaming and in large bowls (which sometimes makes the food quantity appear small, but it isn't). i love the pad thai and pad see ew so much and always get those but perhaps i'll branch out in the future too and try out their pho"
7,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,11/30/2021,"Came here during lunch. Convenient, but not my favorite pho --noodles could be a little more soft and broth a little more beef-y. Beantown definitely still hits the pho spot though if no place else is open!"
8,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,2/27/2021,"We got the pad see yew, honey chicken, samosas, and crab rangoons.

The pad see yew was a little too salty and maybe could have had more flavor/more sweetness, but otherwise was very enjoyable. 

The honey chicken was so darn fried I felt like my stomach would hate me later, but it tasted oh so amazing. It came with steamed broccoli so at least I felt a little healthier.

The samosas were pretty standard, in a cute mini size with a decent spicy kick. My only complaint was that the sweet and sour sauce they came with did not work well. I think they would have been better complemented by a yogurt and dill sauce maybe.

The crab rangoons came free with our order on Uber Eats! They were smaller than normal rangoons, but just as delicious. My fiancÃ© didn't like the lack of dough/crispness, but I thought the ratio of dough to filling was perfect.

Probably won't be coming here too often because we're trying to be healthy, but this will definitely be a go-to for comfort food.Crab Rangoon"
9,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,1/10/2022,Small shop on newbury street that was mostly full on a weekday. You could smell the soup once you walk in and it tasted just as good!
10,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,12/20/2021,"i really wanted to convince myself that i had a great meal here, but i would probably be lying. although every aspect of our experience was good, the dish i ordered ended up being quite lackluster.
-you can order for pickup online or dine in. it doesn't seem like they had any outdoor dining tables outside at the time, but the inside of the restaurant has about 15 medium-sized tables. i'm not sure if they take reservations, but you could probably call to ask. we came relatively early at around 5:00 pm, so we got seated right away. however, it can get quite crowded during peak meal hours.
-the service here was pretty good and nothing to complain about. our waitress was really friendly and attentive, and our food took no more than 15 minutes to come out. 
-since we paid in cash, i'm not sure if they accept card payments. 

11/13/21
-pad thai with chicken: this was the only dish that i ordered, and i was unfortunately quite disappointed in it. i'm a huge fan of pad thai and have had it from many different restaurants in the past, but the one here just had a strange taste to it. the sauce didn't really taste like peanuts, but more like vinegar? i'm not really sure why, but it made the noodles' flavor very off. the ground peanuts, egg, bean sprouts, and scallions inside didn't really make it any better. not to mention, the chicken was pretty bland and its texture resembled rubber; i'm not sure if it was undercooked or something. although the overall portion was generous, it still wasn't worth the $12 before tax. (3/5)

overall, i would be open to coming back to beantown in the future, but probably to try some of their other dishes. perhaps i just came by on an off day, but i just didn't feel like my meal was that great. while i wouldn't necessarily recommend their pad thai, my friend really enjoyed the pho that she got for takeout!"
11,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,11/8/2021,"This has become one of my go-to spots for Vietnamese and Thai cuisine. Fresh limeade and Thai iced tea are very delicious and consistently tasty! Â The beef skewers is a nice appetizer. I had their chicken skewers and that was pretty good too since it came with peanut sauce to pair with it. Their pho ga (chicken noodle soup) is definitely a popular entree! And I enjoyed how they snip up and break down into easier to eat crispy noodles so it's not a big chunk. They were able to make crispy noodle with crispy chicken! Great customer service, too!"
12,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,6/6/2021,"I am so glad I found this place!! 

I ordered the Ga Sate Soup, a spicy chicken Pho with all the fixins (Basil, Bean Sprouts, Hoisin, Siracha, lime). My husband got the Crispy Chicken Pad Thai. The food was hot, FRESH & delicious. 

The service was great, our server offered great recommendations! I will definitely be back!!"
13,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,2/14/2022,Great place to have cold beer and take break. Walking the freedom trail and had the opportunity to take a break and have a beer here. Great place to sit and chill while being a tourist.
14,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,10/24/2021,"We got takeout here and brought it back to our hotel. Food was ready in 20 minutes and the lady that greeted me was so friendly and helpful. I asked her if they had paper plates, which they didn't as expected but she gave me some takeout covers which work great as make-do plates and plastic utensils. We had the panang curry chicken and the pad kraw pow. Both were delicious and had just the right amount of spiciness. Â Nothing like rice with Thai food to hit the spot."
15,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,9/30/2021,Such a good experience here! The fresh rolls were very typical and the peanut sauce was excellent and thick. I really enjoyed my mi hoanh thanh and my husband was a big fan of the pho tai. Price was very decent ($30 for the two of us). We will definitely be back!
16,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,11/12/2021,"Finally had some Vietnamese food in Boston I am not disappointed. The pho was delicious and I ate every bite Â It's a cute little restaurant and they sat us quickly. Next time you're in Newberry street, make sure to stop by Beantown Pho & Grill!!"
17,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,6/28/2021,"Stoped here for dinner while on Newberry street after the Red Sox game. Â It's a bit hidden, under the building, below ground. It's cozy inside, and the staff was friendly and attentive. I ordered the Pho Ga, it had a nice veggie broth, shredded chicken, bean sprouts, rice noodles, scallions cilantro, basil and comes with a fresh lime wedge. I really enjoyed it. I personally love Pho, so I've eaten it at several places over the years and this was one of my favorites. One member of my group had the Chicken Pad Thai and also really enjoyed it, another had the drunken noodles Â He eats Thai food quite often and he said it was the best he had ever had. Â Also the iced tea beverages were very good. I loved the plain unsweetened green iced tea, and also tried the lime aid lemonade. It was a tad sour but was still really good. I think it's a great spot and I'll definitely be back next time in town."

21,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,9/6/2021,I am not from the city but this has been our go-to place whenever we visit the city. We have been going since 2014 and cannot get enough. The staff is nice and the food always leaves me with a smile on my face.
22,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,3/22/2021,This spot has very generous portion sizes. I got the Pho Ga and Crispy Rolls. Both of these were extremely flavorful. The menu had many great options and I will definitely be going again.
23,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,2/1/2022,"I came here on a day I was in the area shopping and decided to come here to try as I started to get hungry walking around. I usually like to go to dorchester, Pho Le, for my quick fix but wanted to try to see if other pho places in boston would be able to match the food. I ordered the bo kho and when it arrived to the table, it looked pretty good just from its appearance. At first, it tasted not too bad at all and I didn't have anything bad to say , however, as I kept eating my noodles, it tasted quite sweet, like overly sweet. It was just too much flavor in the soup that made it kinda not drinkable. The staff were very nice which was a good thing and made sure that everyone who wanted to dine here showed proof of vaccinations in order to eat here. But I think food wise, at least with the bo kho, it was just a like a sugary beef noodle broth, and it was a little odd to me because normally there is no sugary taste whenever I have bo kho? Like I don't mind sweeetness from the carrots but it was just a bit too much flavor that I was not looking for."
24,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,1/19/2021,Ok. Â Absolutely unbelievable food. Â Fresh. Well made and super delicious. Â  Got house rice. Â Chicken astray and goyza Peking dumplings.

25,Beantown Pho & Grill,1 star rating,11/7/2021,"They don't honor the time for online orders and only start preparing things once you arrive to pick them up, even if the initial pick time was 20 minutes after ordering. Very disrespectful and inconsiderate given that it starting to get cold outside and you can't wait inside the restaurant. Also, when I finally received the pho, the broth was not hot enough to cook the uncooked meat :("
26,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,11/6/2021,Just okay! Would go if you're in the area but wouldn't visit just for this alone. Check out Saigon Fusion instead
27,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,8/7/2021,"The location is down the steps, basic seating with stylish industrial lighting and some bar stools facing the window. Service was quick, Thai iced tea was a good mix of sweet and milky but not too much, served in a jar :) We ordered the Tom Yum which had a creamier color to it, thick flat noodles, and the Tom yum flavor was on point. Also ordered pad thai with crispy chicken, the crispy chicken was so delicious but the noodles could have used more fried egg mixed in. Drunken noodles were also ordered, it wasn't too spicy but all the main ingredients and flavor was par. I'd definitely go again !"
28,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,8/20/2019,"We visited Beantown Pho & Grill for dinner at around 6:50. There was a little of a wait (20min) to get a table for 4. Â We reviewed the menu while we waited. 

Once we were seated our server took our drink orders. Â and since we were already hungry from walking around Newbury we gave our food orders a well. Â  We ordered the Crispy Chicken Fried Rice, and the Bo Sate Pho Soup. We also decided to try the Taro and Mango Boba Smoothies. 

The Crispy Chicken Fried Rice Dinner order was a decent size and filling. The Bo Sate Pho soup came steaming hot so we had to let it cool for a little. The soup had a Spicy/Sour flavor with a good amount of beef and noodles. Â The Sliced Tomato and Cucumbers complimented the soup nicely. 

Our picks for the night we're the Boba smoothies. The sweet and fruity Mango Smoothie won over the Taro."
29,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,10/25/2020,"For some reason the noodles tasted like tap water... fresh roll had one tiny shrimp in it :(

31,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,6/12/2019,"Delicious Vietnamese food in a cute, not-too-crowded spot on Newbury Street with amazing Avocado Smoothies? Yes please!!!!!!

A friend and I stopped by for dinner the other night and had a great time. I got my usual Avocado Smoothie and Grilled Shrimp Vermicelli Bowl. My friend and I usually split an Avocado Smoothie but a few sips in, we were both overwhelmed with happiness and realized that we each needed our own. It tasted so fresh and avocado like and wasn't too overpowering on the sweetness level. So delicious!!! The Grilled Shrimp Vermicelli Bowl was good, but probably could have used more vermicelli in it! For the first time ever, I felt like I had way too much topping and not enough noodle. I suppose some would say that that's a way better deal, but I really just needed a bit more vermicelli and then the ratios would've been perfect.

Service was fast and efficient. Not the friendliest, but not rude or too pushy either. Would absolutely come back after a day of shopping in the area, or just because I'm craving Avocado Smoothie."

33,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,4/18/2020,"3.5 stars.

I'm not a fan of Newbury Street for eats in general because most joints are overpriced and bougie, so I am grateful for Beantown Pho.

It's a cozy little spot that's easy to miss, serving up apps, pho, rice, noodles, and bubble tea. 

The pho is a bit untraditional, but I like their pho sate dish quite a lot because it actually has a nice kick to it. You can get pho or egg noodles, so I always appreciate that option as a noodle fanatic. 

I've had a couple of their fried rice and noodle dishes and found them to be quite mediocre. I think their sauces are a bit too sweet and that easily overwhelms the taste of the noodles, protein, and veggies.

Prices are fair, though the portions seem smaller than that of other restaurants. But as I said, I can't complain about these prices on Newbury Street!"
34,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,4/23/2021,"We ordered vermicelli with fish sauce and vegetables (Bun), some spring rolls, and a wonton soup. The Buns were quite decent, so were the spring rolls. Perfectly satisfactory, but not outstanding. We would order these dishes again. Quantity of fish sauce was generous. The wonton soup on the other hand was just ok - I'd skip."
35,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,8/22/2021,"We found this place on a whim while trying to grab a bite before a Red Sox game. Loved the ambience, felt really cozy. I can never decide between Thai and Vietnamese so here I got the best of both worlds. Service was quick and the food was delicious. Also, reasonable prices, $11 for each of our entrees. I highly recommend what we ordered: the Tom Yum coconut soup and Pad See Ew."
36,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,2/4/2020,A traditional ppl restaurant with Â quick service. Their dumplings were good but the sauce was far too sweet. Â The pho dac viet was perfect - the broth was excellent even if the size of the portion was on the small size. The pho ga was like the best chicken soup with aromatics. The location in newbury st Is super convenient and pho is such a warming soup for these cold winter days!
37,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,3/1/2020,"It took me a bit to find the place but I definitely smelled the food fragrance from the street so follow your nose :) The place is downstair so at the street level, you gonna have to look down a bit.
The food is yummy. Service is fast and the waitresses are friendly. I ordered Ice Vietnamese Coffee, Spring Rolls, and Canh Chua Noodle soup with yellow noodles. They are delicious. The coffee is great. It was not overly sweet, which I love.
Their menu has quite a selection. Pricing is great, won't burn hole in your wallet. I would definitely call this place a neighborhood restaurant rather than a tourist place. I would come back again for food."
38,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,4/26/2020,"Just discovered this place recently and the food was amazing. I hope they are consistent in the quality of their food, it's was my first time.

We tried the fresh shrimp roll. It was very good but I thought was too little. It was more on the skinny side compare to other fresh rolls. Their peanut sauce was really good.

Panang curry with chicken was tasty but I had better at other places in the city. 

Their pad see eww was really good prepared the way I requested using the correct brocoli (Chinese broccoli) as it should be. Was very tasty. I have only three criticism to make it perfect. I wish the noodles were wider, chard or brown more from the wok and wish all the chicken was tender. I felt that some of the chicken was over cooked.

Pho Ga soup was amazing and perfect that's why I have this place 5 stars.

Service was amazing, they are very nice and the place is clean.

The one negative thing is their location. It is hard to find and parking is a nightmare.

I wrote this review a year or more again for some reason it was never posted. We have to this place multiple times since then and it has always been very good. Will definitely go there again."

41,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,1/2/2019,"I work right around Copley so this is my go to lunch place for pho. They have the cutest spot on Newbury that's partly underground. On nice days they open up the patio so you can eat outside and watch the people walking by, which I also highly recommend.

Okay, let's get to the food! The only thing I ever get here is pho and thai iced tea. Thai iced tea is always good. I always get the pho tai and my boyfriend always gets the pho dac biet. Always superb. The broth is something that we always crave on cold rainy days and it's a great price for Newbury.

This cute spot has really nice ambiance. They don't have that many seats, but whenever I go for lunch, they are quick about serving us and the staff are always super friendly. My boyfriend likes his pho really spicy, so we brought a ghost pepper hot sauce once and they came over and asked my boyfriend if it was spicy. They asked if they could try some and took it to the back. Then the waitresses all came out confirming that indeed it was super spicy. 

I usually try to avoid the lunch rush by going at 11:30 or after 12:30 and I rarely have to wait. They also play the best music. I think I'd call it 'alternative modern pop'. I often make my boyfriend read the spotify playlist they have playing on the plugged-in phone so I can listen to it at home.
 
Overall, very cute place. Not the best pho I've ever had, but the people, presentation, and the feel of the place really makes this place special."
42,Beantown Pho & Grill,2 star rating,6/23/2021,"Two stars only for the gyoza. It was soft and tasted good even though it was delivered, but the entree was horrible. The chicken basil was supposed to be batter fried (the batter kept falling off) but most importantly, how do you over cook chicken so much that it's hard to chew? I understand delivered food suffers a little on quality and freshness but this was abysmal."
43,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,6/2/2020,"I came in for a quick snack and got the vermicelli noodle bowl with shrimp. The meal felt very clean and healthy, despite what I'm used to from traditional Vietnamese restaurants which could feel a bit heavy on the stomach. Loved the noodles but the shrimp was hard to peel for me maybe because I am clumsy. I got the egg roll for an extra $1 and it was delish. Definite great on the go food."

I think that this is not a real authentic Vietnamese restaurant, more like Asian fusion restaurant.

Despite that, the soup was differently good, especially marinated pork was tasty."

They put nuts in my food, then had the audacity to argue with me about the request for nuts. It was very unprofessional and concerning. The lady that answers the phone had bad business practices. I will never go back. Thai Basil is a better restaurant."
53,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,1/26/2018,"This is my new favorite restaurant in Back Bay. After ordering takeout from here a few times (and being perfectly satisfied), a group of 3 of us made it in here one chilly Thursday night. We had originally tried to go to the ramen place down the street, but there was a huge line outside in the freezing cold..meanwhile, Beantown Pho & Grill was right down the street with delicious food and warm pho...with no wait!!! I hope people don't find out about how good this place is or else it'll get crowded. 

The menu has a huge variety of various Thai + Pho dishes, as well as dessert and drinks. Not sure if anything is authentic, but the diversity of the menu was enough to draw me in. The spicy calamari is the BEST appetizer you can get! Calamari was cooked perfectly, and I couldn't get enough of the flavor. The pho was quite delicious too; while not the huge steaming bowls I was used to in Philly, it's probably a healthy-sized portion with enough meat to satisfy. 

Finally, I was a big fan of the bubble tea (bubbles are very chewy) and service! Will be my go-to place to eat if looking for an easy meal when I don't cook."
54,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,4/3/2019,"Found it looking for a quick bite and even tho it's busy it is fast, and he prices are fair especially for this neighborhood.
The octopus appetizer was gone in about five seconds after it hit the table, and the main dishes came out in less than ten.
Honey chicken is crispy and delicious, the chau chau, if you ask for extra spicy, it WILL be extra spicy! Wow! Love it. It's so hard to find a good noodle shop!
Everything about the place feels fresh and on point. Lovin' it."
55,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,3/19/2019,"Maybe three stars is more accurate than the enthusiastic four stars I initially suggested?

I've now been three times. Â The first visit with Pad Kra Praw was the best, followed by today's Spicy Chicken Gochujang, which had enough jalapenos to make my tongue sweat (not a complaint). Â The middle trip with the Thai Red Curry was a little meager and lackluster, but to each their own.

One unfortunate experience that impacted the star rating is that on the middle trip, I brought a friend who hadn't been there before, and he asked if he could substitute extra veggies in lieu of rice, even if there were an extra charge. Â They refused, which surprised us both.

I doubt that he'll return, which I understand. Â That's disappointing because I would easily have invited other local colleagues to try it with me if it weren't for that."

61,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,9/17/2018,"Perfect if you're a lone diner. Customer service is great, the restaurant is super clean. Come during lunch because of the lunch pricing. 

The only issue I had was that my Drunken Noodles with shrimp was very bland. I also only got like...3 shrimp that costed extra. Food is okay but nothing crazy. I would come again during lunch and try something else."
62,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,11/9/2019,"One of my favorite lunch spots around Back Bay. It's located in a cool little basement spot with a nice vibe. Minimal seating options so sometimes there's a little wait.

The food is great, good portions and fair prices. It also comes out fairly quick, so great for lunches during work days."
63,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,8/13/2018,"Take my review with a grain of salt, as I didn't get any pho. Perhaps the pho is their best item, but I was craving some simple pad thai and crab rangoon, so I can only rate those dishes.

The crab rangoons are possibly my favorite that I've found in the city in the 3 years we've lived here. Great balance of crispy wonton and the right amount of filling. I would definitely get these again!

Unfortunately, the pad thai was really bland. I know it's not traditionally a spicy dish, but there was zero spice, very little sweetness or sourness. Just the most flat-flavored dish I've had in a while, and the chicken was really overcooked. That said, it wasn't the worst pad thai I've had, but it just lacked interest. I would possibly try it again, but I'd try to ask for some spice and hope that was enough to bring the dish to life.

Otherwise, the space is really cozy and cleaner than many of the restaurants that I've been to in the garden level of buildings in Back Bay. There's also a nice, small outdoor patio. With the really pleasant staff, it's a relatively safe bet for a decent meal. I just wouldn't recommend the pad thai."
64,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,10/23/2020,This is my local favorite Thai place. The soups with coconut base are yummy. My go to is drunken noodles and Thai basil fried rice.
65,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,6/22/2018,"So you want some Pho? You want some fresh veggies? Quick service? Actually tender protein and whole meatballs? I have found your ""other"" Pho restaurant in the Back Bay Area of Boston... I only waited for my Pho like 10min, if even that long... The five spice broth was really super tasty and actually better than another Pho restaurant I visited prior... These are all of my upsides...

Now the down side... only one size bowl on the Pho so come hungry or you are leaving food on the table... The protein was a little on low side in quantity but see above about the meatball... and I had some gristle... I always have the tenderloin and meatball... veggies were fresh and crunchy but mostly bean sprouts, some cilantro and lime wedges... so if you missing some jalapeÃ±o or anything else you may have to ask... They may have been having a slow night but I only saw a few tables come and go while I was there... 

I normally only rate a restaurant after I have been there at least twice but as this was a business trip and it was delicious, I had to post... 

By-the-by, I was at another Pho restaurant the prior night, they are neck and neck..."
66,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,8/30/2018,"I've eaten here at least 2 dozen times. Food is consistent, service is friendly. Lunch special updated set is a good value for $2 extra. Great pho, fresh rolls and sa ot."
67,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,7/27/2020,"Order the fried chicken wings and pho dac biet. 

Chicken wings were juicy and crispy. I think they battered the chicken lightly with flour before frying. Would order again. 

Pho was ok. The broth had a strong cinnamon and star anise flavor but could have been beefier. 

Everything was packaged nicely and employees were wearing masks and gloves when I went to pick up. 

Would def order again from here!"
68,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,4/28/2018,"I've ordered from Beantown Pho & Grill twice now! I usually get the crab rangoon, pad thai, and of course, a Thai iced tea. I've heard great things about Beantown, and it always seems packed when I go to pick up my order. 

The crab rangoons are uniquely shaped, but don't worry, they taste scrumptious! Crispy on top, filled with warm cream cheese and crab that bursts in mouthfuls. 

The pad thai was wonderful. Umai is usually my go to for take out in the area, and I think Beantown just supplanted it!"
69,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,2/18/2020,"Ordered delivery on Sunday night, took about 45 minutes via Uber Eats. Food still arrived hot and in good condition, we were excited for the meal! 

Like most Chinese / Japanese restaurants, I got chicken fried rice. Overall, taste was good although the size of carrots and broccoli were a little too large for my liking. Additionally, the quantity was slightly lacking as I was still hungry after eating the entire meal. 

Really not too much else to say, given I don't enjoy the cuisine too much but one of the better Restaurants in Boston I've tried. 

Disappointed with no fortune cookie or tiny cracker sticks. Love those at these types of places! 

Overall, 4/5 and likely more of a 3.5/5 if I was able to give half stars. Would order again, but not necessarily my go to."
70,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,10/3/2019,"So delicious after a long day! Had the tofu and veggie soup followed by the beef pad see ew. Â Spot on and fresh. Â Staff is pleasant. Â Looks a bit shady from the outside but just trust me and go down the twisty stairs, tasty treats await."
71,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,6/12/2018,"Awesome little place to grab fairly affordable lunch on Newbury Street. We sat outside on the patio, which was great since the weather was sunny and the live band across the street was playing music. The service is great with our waiter checking in with us and always making sure our water glasses were filled. I wanted to try their pho, but it was a little hot, so I opted to try the cold vermicelli noodles with shrimp. The waiter did mention the shrimp isn't peeled, so I just had to peel it all before I mixed everything together to eat. The sauce is very faint and light, I wished it was a little more flavorful to add to the dish. The noodles were great, not bunched up or anything and the vegetables added a nice crunch to the dish. I'll definitely be back to try the pho and the mango sticky rice next time!"
72,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,8/17/2019,Good food in the heart of beantown. Was staying in the hotel across the street. Called in an order over the phone from the room. By the time I walked over it was ready.
73,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,9/28/2019,"Delicious food!!! Â  We had the Pad Thai, wonton soup, Vietnamese fried rice, and a Thai iced tea. Â  All so tasty and so reasonably priced!

Small spot but cute. Â Great location."
74,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,3/31/2018,"I've been meaning to try this place since the reviews are good, and stopped in on a Saturday night around 7pm. The place was pretty full but we got seated for 2 immediately.

They have a wide menu, but the drinks also look interesting. There is a chalkboard menu above the counter to check out. The interior is cozy and comfortable, not too loud.

We ordered the pho dac biet and the mi haisan. Both were delicious and the portions are a good size. I had the mi haisan, and I liked the clear, light broth with the nutty flavor of the sesame oil. The basil and sprouts on the side were fresh. I also got the jasmine limeade, which was delicious! The first one I've tried where you actually get a hint of the floral jasmine flavor. Service was fast and friendly, and prices are decent.

I'll be back here for sure whenever I need my pho fix in Back Bay."
75,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,9/18/2017,"At first glance, this place seemed teeny tiny. There were maybe 4 or 5 outdoor tables and most of those were 2 seaters. Â If you look closer, there is a relatively spacious indoor seating downstairs also. It is basement seating and probably a little stuffy in the summer. 

The food is authentic and probably considered good by Boston standards but we've Â had much better Vietnamese food in NJ and PA. The portion size is smaller than what we are used to. I ordered the beef with vermicelli entree. The beef is not the standard thin, barbecue marinated slices that I usually get. These were sliced chunks more akin to a Chinese style dish. 

We waited for an outdoor table and it was well worth the wait. People watching on the busy Newbury St made for a great atmosphere."
76,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,4/2/2018,"My friend and I went here for a late night bite in the city. We have had Pho' before but when we saw on the menu, a Sweet and Sour Pho' we were like what?! 

So naturally we decided to order that with no expectations of how it may taste. After my first bite I was pleasantly surprised, it was delicious! Needless to say we both finished our bowls and I can confidently say I'd certainly go back again!"
77,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,5/23/2019,3.5 rating. Great for a quick bite during lunch. Decent portions and good lunch deals.
78,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,1/6/2019,"What do you do when hungover in a new city? 

Find the closest bowl of pho. 

I've been spoiled by Los Angeles for sure but unfortunately the pho at beantown pho and grill left me wanting more. First of all, they only had pho dac biet, pho tai, and pho ga. Where are my combinations? Pho chin nam? Pho chay? Plus there was a lot of Thai food on the menu. Not bad but not what I expected from a place that had pho in its name. 

The broth itself is aromatic but wasn't beefy at all. I like a balance between the two flavors. They gave 5 chewy beef pieces. Huge portion of noodles and broth though!

Probably a combination of the area I was in and my expectations. Perspective from someone who has lived in Atlanta and Los Angeles and has become accustomed to authentic pho."
79,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,5/8/2018,"Came after 5PM on a Monday and the restaurant had plenty of seating. There are tables both inside and outside. 
The pho here is served in a light, fragrant broth. The broth smells quite strongly of star anise, so may not be for anyone irritated by strong smells. The broth does not have the depth of flavor that some other Vietnamese shops offer, but it's quite good value relative to Boston prices. 

Service was rather slow, we waited 30 minutes before a server came despite the restaurant being quite empty."
80,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,12/5/2017,"If you are craving something hot and soupy after a long day of shopping on Newbury street on a cold winter's day, this is the place for you!

While I have walked along Newbury street dozens of times, I have never noticed this restaurant until I discovered it on yelp. I am so happy to discover it because the food is good and affordable! 

This place offers a mix of Thai and Vietnamese cuisine with a pretty typical selection of dishes. The husband and I opted to try the duck noodle soup and coconut tom yum noodles. The duck noodle soup was served with a generous amount of sliced duck, thin yellow noodles and the broth was quite sweet with subtle flavors of five spice. The tom yum noodles were not as spicy as I hoped they would be, but nevertheless, it had a good broth and quite generous amount of chicken and shrimp. It was served with flat rice noodles, and if I had to be picky, the noodles were a slightly overcooked and were broken in tiny pieces.

The wait time was surprisingly only 10 minutes when we arrived at 6.30 in a Saturday, but the line got longer and longer as it got later. So come slightly earlier if you want to avoid the wait!

The prices of the dishes were extremely reasonable and affordable especially since this is Newbury street we are talking about! For two people, our bill was less than/around 25 dollars including tip. 

The service was efficient and minimal, don't expect small talk.

Overall, I am really glad to have found this place. While I would not commute here just to eat at this restaurant, this will definitely be one of the options for me when I am around the area."
81,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,4/16/2018,"Visited Beantown twice while in Boston for dinner on a Saturday night and for lunch on a Monday. Sat night we had to wait about 15-20 mins for a table to open up to accommodate our party of five. The restaurant is small as are more restaurants on Newbury but it's cozy and comfortable.

The staff was very nice and patient with us as we made up our minds on our dinner options.

We had the fresh spring rolls, shrimp shumai and the takoyaki for apps- all delicious but the shrimp shumai was def my favorite and worth coming back for alone! 

I ordered their pho dac biet soup which comes with a combo of five different cuts of meat and a delicious broth! It was delicious. 

Next time your on Newbury do yourself a favor and check out Beantown!"
82,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,10/5/2019,"Has a small, but nice cozy feel to the restaurant. Service was pretty good along with a great menu to choose from. I ordered Pho and love it. Also there are good vegetarian options for pho too."
83,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,9/5/2015,"Came here for a family dinner and enjoyed every minute of it! It was actually a very special laid back dinner. Good ol Yelp helped me select this place and we were extremely happy we dined here! The menu is a mix of a Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, a bit of everything. Our meal was outdoors on the patio as it was a humid summer evening but we wanted to eat and enjoy outside on a nice summer evening. We came here for Thai food and it was awesome. The meal was what you expect from Thai food. Spicy in flavour with some sweet, creamy and salty. Overall exceptional. 

Items ordered:

Thai Iced tea- creamy and with lots of ice. The perfect accompagniant to a spicy meal. 

Fresh spring rolls- crisp lettuce, fresh and delicious as an app. 

Spicy calamari- tender crispy calamari with chopped jalapeÃ±o and fried peppers and onion with some chilli seasoning. Outstanding. 

Chicken curry- creamy orange in colour. sweet and exactly how we enjoy it with beans, broccoli and carrots and thinly sliced chicken

Beef drunken noodles- probably the slightest dissapoinment dish as not as sweet and spicy as preferred. But still fragrant and tasty. 

Pad Thai w crispy chicken. - chicken seasoned very light but crispy and delicious. 

Service was attentive and pleasant. A good choice if you are staying in the area. Definitely would return again!"
84,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,11/6/2018,"The food:
I had the pad thai w/ beef. Serving size was decent, and the noodles were delicious. The beef was very moist and the whole dish had a lot of flavor and nuances. It wasn't overly sweet like some other places. Will definitely be back for more! Â 

The other stuff:
Service is great. It's packed during dinner time, especially on the weekend."
85,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,3/11/2018,First time having real Vietnamese food and I am a new fan. Sweet staff and delicious food. The restaurant itself is a little hard to find which makes it more intimate. Chicken pad Thai and the vegetable rolls tasted fresh and made to order. Highly recommend anything on the menu. Leftovers can be taken home so don't worry about over ordering.
86,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,4/17/2019,"Been here multiple times. Very consistent and very good. I used to travel into C-town to get great cost food. But I usually stay in the Back Bay Area and this spot is just so convenient on Newbury. 

They have a great Pho and they have some selections that are ok for someone with gluten free allergy or celiacs. You have to ask the wait staff to be sure because the menu is not 100% clear, but they usually clarify and confirm your concerns. 

If they updated their menu to provide clear guidance and gave celiac patrons a gf menu, that would help a lot. 

Either way 5 stars for the food, location and service."
87,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,2/20/2019,"Oh my! The fuck noodle soup is out of this world. The broth is seasoned with warm spices, the fuck is flavorful, and everything else about it is delicious. The soup came in three containers. One for the broth, one for the noodles, broccoli, and duck, and the last with lime, basil, sauces, and beach sprouts!
 Order it now!!!"
88,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,11/19/2017,"Party of six went for a birthday dinner and everything was Â so good!!
Staff was attentive; ambience was very cute and cozy; drinks and food came out very fast; everything was super yummy.
I had the Saigon salad (shrimp and shredded chicken salad) and it was a perfect light meal.
Also all the drinks came in cute glass mason jars which is always a plus.
The one thing I would note is that the bathrooms could use some maintenance... 
But overall a very positive experience and the bill was less than 80$ (before tip) with 5 entrees and 4 drinks!!"
89,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,1/29/2019,"The food was delicious, i feel like a bad person right now because i can't even remember what i ordered, but everyone in my party was satisfied with their food. We hit this place up before a show, note the seating area is very small, so we had a little wait, but never fear. There is an awesome harry potter store that may or may not have taken up our time and money while waiting on our table. The wait staff was very nice, and quick with service. I'll definitely be back here the next time i'm in Boston."
0,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,4/3/2022,"10/10 would come back to Boston just for Luke's!!!!! 
The 3oz lobster flight was an amazing way to try all the different sauces added. We got the butter flight (truffle butter, hot honey & garlic butter). Each bun was warm and toasted to perfection and the lobster was amazing!!!!! The original lobster roll was also great! stuffed and over flowing with lobster. 
The lobster bisque was served piping hot with chunks of lobster in it. This was my first time having lobster bisque, so I don't have any comparisons but it was good! 
The blueberry lemonade is a Luke's special, it had a nice pucker to it. Personally am not a fan of blueberry but I didn't mind it."
1,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,4/9/2022,"Great spot with enjoyable food ! 
New Yorker visiting for a weekend, i automatically would love to try MA crowders and sea food rolls! We googled top in the area and Luke's Lobster was the winner. 
We got the Lukes Trio that comes with mini sea food rolls (lobster, crab and shrimp) and a small soup which we went with Clam Crowder. 
We also got a large of Lobster Bisque and have to admit I've had better."
2,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,2/27/2022,"This place was amazing. Only slight negative was how long it took for the food to come out but I think that was mostly due to hanger and all the amazing butter smells in the building lol.

The lobster roll... wow. I seriously haven't tasted anything so amazing. The bun was perfectly toasted, the lobster was so moist and buttery. Also, everything stayed so well together in the bun... how?????? 

Clam chowder, so thick and creamy. 

Definitely check them out if you're in the area."
3,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,3/30/2022,"Wow! So yummy and fresh! I had the sandwich trio which included a 2oz lobster, carb, and shrimp roll. They were amazing! You can tell the fish was extremely fresh. My favorites were the lobster and carb. One of the workers recommended I try the spicy hot honey and OMG what a difference. It really gave the sandwiches an extra kick! Highly recommend!"
4,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,1/26/2022,"We had no clue this was a chain until we arrived. The clam chowder was suburb and the lobster trio was delicious. We also got the shrimp roll which was extremely generous with overflowing shrimp. 

The quality was not what I would have expected for a chain, it was just as great as some of the top line restaurants we went to in Boston. Definitely recommend.

One con was they don't offer any free water for customers so be sure to buy some water bottles when placing your order."
5,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,4/11/2022,Truffle Â butter Â lobster roll. I love a Maine lobster roll. I'm sooooo glad someone thought to use TRUFFLE butter. This lobster roll was magical and absolutely made my day.
6,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/12/2022,"Wow, did not think a little 4 oz meal could blow me away. Yet Luke's did just that. I got the 4 oz lobster roll with a gluten free bun and my husband got the regular 4 oz lobster roll. We were both impressed by the amount of lobster on the rolls- perfect ratios. The flavoring was perfect and the lobster meat was SO fresh. They even have a board they update daily with where the the seafood is sourced from. The lobster when we went was from Maine. 
I will definitely make a point to be back every time I am in Boston."
7,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,2/18/2022,"I wanted a seafood place for my last day in Boston and came across Luke's. Â It's very clean, sufficient seating and easy to see menus. Â You place your order then get your drink and find a seat. Â I couldn't decide so I ordered the lobster roll trio which was lobster, crab, and shrimp rolls. Â They were delicious! Â I don't know which I could say was my favorite and each had a unique taste. Â I wish I had been able to try the lobster Mac N cheese, guess I'll need to return."
8,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,11/21/2021,"We popped into the place for Sunday lunch

Decided on the trip of lobster rolls and a clam chowder 

I liked the lemon butter the best 
Hubby liked the truffle the best 

But all three were really good 

The let down was the clam chowder, it was good but needed seasoning as badly as Fergie from black eyed peas needs singing lessons. And it felt watered down."
9,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,3/25/2022,"This was the perfect place to try my first lobster roll! Served chilled on a toasted roll, the lobster had good flavor with the butter herb marinade. It also comes with a side of more butter as well. I got this to go with a cup of clam chowder and the pickup was so easy and convenient. The inside was very nice and clean as well so there is no problem ordering in too!"
10,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,1/23/2022,"Ordered: Lobster Roll, Clam Chowder

The lobster roll was just okay, nothing special. Maybe it would've tasted better if the lobster was more flavorful and the bun was toasted more. The clam chowder was also disappointing. The consistency wasn't thick enough and the flavor was subpar. Overall, wouldn't recommend as there are better places in Boston to get a lobster roll and satisfy your seafood craving."
11,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/10/2021,"We're in Boston, we HAD to try a lobster roll. Â Fortunately, after a day of touring Boston, we were able to get delivery!! Sweet!

Our whole group ordered 4 oz lobster rolls, 9 of them. Â The rolls were on a bun the size of a standard hotdog bun. Â Initially, we were underwhelmed with the size but after digging into it, it was plentiful and filling. Â It came with melted butter and was well seasoned. Â 

What an experience! I loved every bite! My first lobster roll did not disappoint!!"
12,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/14/2022,The food was incredibly fresh and the service was great. Â Don't let the small sandwiches fool you. Â They are filling.
13,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,9/25/2021,"I think the lobster in this lobster rolls is really fresh! The size of the lobster roll is relatively small, but because it's fresh and yummy, I'd still recommend you to try it out. 

I personally think the lobster rolls from Pauli's (Boston Little Italy) and from here are the best!f"
14,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,8/28/2021,"There rolls are a must! The price was super fair and well worth it for the amount you get. The bread is buttered and tasted sooo good. 

The lines are constantly long but it goes by quick. There's both indoor and outdoor seating. 

Lobster roll was $24/4oz and crab roll was $16/4oz."
15,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,12/21/2021,"Nothing but awesome things to say about this Lobster joint! Was just a short 4 minute walk away from my family's hotel and was very easy to pop into for a quick bite. It was also my girlfriend's first time trying a lobster roll, she loved it! They did offer the lobster roll to be served New England Style, only Maine style. Nonetheless, still some quality lobster meat! The Clam Chowder was also very good. I recommend the Luke's Trio because you get to try out some great Crab and Shrimp in addition to lobster. Definitely hit this place up for an amazing lobster roll!"
16,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,12/6/2021,"Roll was delicious, spicy honey butter was addictive, it does what its supposed to and service was great."
17,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,8/26/2021,"Luke's Lobster was delicious! 

There is a 4oz and a 6oz Lobster roll, if you're hungry go for the 6oz. The Shrimp, Crab and Lobster combo was delightful although the rolls are about 2 inches in size so you get enough to taste but leave wanting more. 

Clam chowder was really good too."
18,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,8/25/2021,"My family and I wanted a light lunch before exploring Boston and when in Boston, you get a lobster roll. We originally were going to get the Luke's trio with clam chowder to share but the worker was like ""Just one for the 3 of you?"" and told us it was really small. We ended up getting 2 orders to share and good thing we did because those sandwiches would've been the smallest bite to share between 3 of us!

I was the most excited for the lobster but the crab ended up being my favorite! The seafood is fresh and I loved the buttered roll. The clam chowder was hearty and warm and the perfect accompaniment for the rainy weather outside. Probably would get the crab combo if I'm in next time around and I want to try their mac and cheese since it seems to be quite popular."
19,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,12/16/2021,"I was very steadfast on trying Luke's Lobster when I visited Boston lol. Now thinking back I really didn't understand why as there were many Luke's Lobster in other states. Anyways the lobster roll was good. The lobster was pretty fresh and retains it's good texture. There were not much sauces nor any veggie in the roll, allowing you to fully appreciate the taste of lobster, which I really liked. The clam chowder was full of ingredients. Taste wise it's better than the ones you would get as complimentary dish in hotel/restaurant but not that much better."
20,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,2/20/2022,"A friend suggested this place after a night of drinking (ha!) and my boyfriend and I wanted to indulge in a few more lobster rolls before we head back to Philly. Man, I didn't realize lobster rolls were so pricey! But compared to the lobster rolls we had the night before at a higher end restaurant, these lobster rolls were IT! The buns were toasted perfectly and the lobster tasted great. The roll was FILLED and they didn't skimp on the lobster. I just wish this chain had more of a chain restaurant price list. My friend ordered the clam chowder and said it was pretty decent. I would come again for a quick lunch!"
21,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/31/2022,Food is greeeeeaaaaat. Â The lobster in the lobster roll is fresh. Â The deco is also very cool.

Lobster Roll Clam Chowder"
23,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,11/29/2021,My husband and I were doing some Black Friday shopping and wanted a lobster roll. This place did not disappoint! It is a small place and tables fill up! Both of us had the lobster trio. We loved the variety of flavors. Our favorite was the spicy honey. The balance of heat and sweet of the lobster was a perfect marriage. The other two weren't as balanced or flavorful. The lobster corn chowder was tasty too. However it had way too much corn and potatoes and tiny bits of lobster. Overall we loved the take on the traditional lobster roll and it was in a great location!
24,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/21/2021,"is it possible that a place is soo good... that you convince yourself to have it twice in one day? Luke's Lobster Back Bay is!! started with a quick soup of the day it was lobster corn bisque, delicious and hit the spot. ... took a quick walk to the gym around the corner and right after for our 2nd visit - went all out, got the lobster trio [ highly recommend it! ] 

I particularly like the chill laid back atmosphere, small and cozy with this ramp that goes on for days if you need to use the bathroom and metallic so everyone will hear ya when you are walking on it... overall great service cool people and delicious delicious new england lobsta rolls!! buttery, soft but crunchy, and tons and tons of meat!! can't wait to visit again!! 

thank you Luke's Lobster Back Bay!! love it all!

25,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,11/4/2021,"My favorite lobster roll in Boston! Roll was great, chowder was great, sofa was great! Service is always awesome!"
26,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/25/2021,"Juicy, fresh, superb! Luke's trio is an awesome choice if you're undecided and want to try everything Luke's has to offer. The size of the trio comes to about a 6inch roll (and the price, at $20, is comparable to the lobster roll at $18).
But the rolls are AMAZING and they're quite generous with the fillings.
Lobster was definitely a favorite followed closely by the shrimp.
The chowder is also great and satisfying(no pork bits, So it's halal)"
27,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,10/14/2021,Simple and good. The lobster was fresh and we really enjoyed our meal!! Good portion sizes and we liked that you have the option to get the 4oz or the 6oz lobster roll. The white truffle butter added a nice flavor and we loved it!
28,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,10/11/2021,"Tried the lobster roll and clam chowder while visiting Boston and it did not disappoint. The lobster was so fresh, light, and tender! The roll was the perfect complement to the lobster as it was buttered to perfection. Clam chowder was good as well. 

The only knock I have is the price. Felt it was too small of a portion for the price, but overall I'd still recommend because it was that good."
29,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/16/2021,"As a celiac I never thought I would get to eat a lobstah roll ever! This place brought the goods! They have a separate grill for the bread and were so accommodating! They even had a Gluten free chowdah! The lobster was so fresh and I love that it's sustainable. Love everything about this place - It was $80 for two of us to get a roll a soup and a drink. Don't get me wrong- Â it was totally worth it- but at these prices it's more of a splurge occasional meal than one I could enjoy more often. Either way- thanks Luke's for having safe celiac friendly options and an outdoor seating area, Â I know I really appreciate it!!!"
30,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,9/1/2021,My boyfriend and I first meal when we arrived in Boston. It was close by at least 10-15 minutes walking distance. There was no lines when we arrived to Luke's. Best lobster and crab rolls ever! A must try if you are ever in Boston! Decently priced for both rolls.
31,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,9/26/2021,"The place is a bit out of the way in Back Bay and I never would have run across it if I wasn't looking for some seafood places I hadn't tried. It's a really small space with not a lot of seating so I ended up getting my food to go and food a nice spot to sit along Boylston to do my taste testing. All three were great, but I do think my favorite is still the crab roll. Â The rolls all tasted really fresh with just the right amount of butter on the bread and seafood so nothing was drowning but had a great flavor."
32,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,9/3/2021,"It wasn't the best lobster roll I had. Felt like I was eating butter bread like for grilled cheese with the seafood on it. It was a nice way to try lobster roll, crab, and shrimp roll all at once for a quick grab and go bite. Decently priced for the amount we got to try. Definitely more like a fast food chain."
33,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,2/13/2022,We stumbled across this place after ice skating at the front pond. My husband and daughter got the grilled cheese lobster (absolutely amazing) and the lobster Mac and cheese. I got the spicy lobster roll (I didn't like it but that was my mistake because it clearly said spicy on the menu) and the clam chowder. The clam chowder was great. We got some cold Â tea drinks from refrigerator which was ok nothing outstanding. Overall it was decent little place. Super casual and not a lot of seating but we went there was just on other couple. It appeared clean and the staff were very friendly. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but if I was area I would go back for the grilled cheese lobster and clam chowder.
34,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,7/21/2021,"I've got lobstermen in my family, so I can be kind of a snob when it comes to this kind of place. The fact that it's downtown without a waterfront view made me a little nervous (even though most of those places serve subpar seafood). Â I tried this place and WOW this is the best lobster roll I've had south of Maine. Â Staff was clean quick and friendly. Amazing."
35,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,1/27/2022,"First time in Boston and our first eating spot was Luke's. Their rolls are AMAZING! We tried the trio which came with 3 2oz rolls(crab, lobster, shrimp) and ALL were delicious. The bread was toasted just the right amount and was drizzled with butter. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. Stayed in Boston for 3 days and ate at this pace twice because of how good it was!"
36,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,1/8/2022,"Kinda Pricey. The rolls are cold.
The service is good thou.

They have a winter menu

Clam chowder and lobster Mac is a must try!"
37,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,9/1/2021,"It melts in your mouth! sooooo good! 
At first I was a little shocked by the small menu. But when you know what you do well, you do it! 
Luke knows what they do well!!! Holy Cow those are some good rolls!!"
38,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,4/26/2021,"I had avoided coming to Luke's Lobster as I am not a fan of cold lobster rolls which is what they are known for. However, closer inspection of the menu showed that they sold lobster mac and cheese and most importantly they delivered via Door Dash. Wanting to satisfy my lobster craving without going to the usual busy, touristy spots I decided to give them a try and order delivery.

I was quite satisfied with the mac and cheese. Food came warm and there was plenty of lobster in the dish. Yes, the serving is on the small size, however it is sold at a much lower price than at the other places and it was sufficient for a meal. Would definitely recommend if looking for another place to eat more lobster."
39,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,11/4/2020,"The food here is SO good. Got it delivered and wasn't able to eat it hot but every single roll and the Mac and cheese were still phenomenal! I especially enjoyed the crab and shrimp rolls, lobster was a very close tie. They were all buttery and seasoned very well. This was sufficient for 2 people with a moderate appetite. 

I'd come here more if the portions were a bit larger or if it came with more filling side options. I know seafood is expensive but would love having a simple but filling veggie side to make it a bit more affordable on the regular."
40,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/21/2021,"Amazing! That's why we go to the east to have crab, lobster, and shrimp!! In fact they have the little sampler roll on the menu where you can get 3 mini rolls of each lobster, crab, and shrimp! Highly recommend trying this! They also had a corn crab chowder as their special of the day which was very flavorful. My favorite was probably the lobster Mac n cheese side, it was so fun to get a big chunk of lobster meat every few bites. Service was pretty efficient being able to order at the counter and then picking your seat. A must try in back bay"
41,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,11/6/2021,A counter-service place specializing in lobster rolls. I personally don't like the mayo kind of lobster roll but if you're into that they have several that are good. They do have specials and had a truffle lobster roll warm with butter that was amazing.
42,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/8/2022,"First time having a lobster roll, it was delicious. My friend had lobster mac and cheese and was thoroughly impressed. They had good inside seating and a good aesthetic. 10/10 recommend"
43,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,10/8/2021,"I really wanted to love this place based on the great reviews I read. This was actually the first place I visited on my weekend trip to boston from NY. However, I was a bit disappointed in their lobster roll. The lobster was fresh but the size of the roll is way too small for the price. I also felt that the pepper taste was a little overwhelming. My friends also got their clam chowder and the Luke's Trio which includes 1/2 crab, 1/2 lobster, and 1/2 shrimp. I believe they liked the crab the most out of the bunch. The clam chowder was decent but wasn't too impressive. We enjoyed the clam chowder at Atlantic Fish & Co way better. In all, I probably wouldn't come back here if I'm in Boston because there are other spots that are better."
44,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/13/2021,"We got this door dashed and I did not get another lobster roll in Boston because this one was so good. Be forewarned, it is small but SO worth it. The lobster was incredible and the bread was so fresh. I could have eaten a million of those lobster rolls."
45,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,12/23/2021,"We enjoyed quiet setting after busy day of shopping. Lobster was so delicious but buns were cold. I wish they warmed it more. We got Luke Trio , lobster, shrimp and crab sandwich. And regular lobster roll if the bread was warmer, it might been better."
46,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,7/25/2021,"We come here from Florida and make this our first stop. Â The lobster is so fresh and the service is great. Â 

Can't wait to go back!"
47,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,1 star rating,2/22/2022,"We went and tried quite a few items. The rolls were ok, cold and would have preferred warm. Â The clam chowder and lobster bisque were also lukewarm and had not many clams nor lobster in it. Â Luke's trio and lobster Mac n cheese is just enough food for 13yo. The boys were still hungry afterwards. All the food were prepackaged and just heated up and toasted (like Starbucks) and not made in site. We wanted to try rolls and chowder in Boston but quiet disappointed to pay so much for cold prepackaged food that was not enough.. Â this post"
48,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/19/2021,Best lobster I have ever had and best lobster roll I have had in Boston so far (I've tried 3 so far). Â Friendly and not too packed. Â The lobster chowder was also to die for!
49,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,7/23/2021,"First meal in Boston I & my first lobster roll. It was really good! Â Light dressing on the lobster roll & plenty of big, succulent pieces of lint. Not a bunch of fillers. The poppyseed cole slaw was fresh, but needed more dressing. All in all a great welcome to bean town. Got a spicy ginger ale & it was a great accompaniment to the delicate lobster. I'll be back!"
50,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,1/26/2022,A little more pricey than I expected but everywhere is raising prices. Fresh food and the clam chowder was excellent the day I came. It wasn't busy during a January lunch hour so stop by!
51,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,7/2/2021,"Stopped by on a rainy afternoon while visiting a friend in Boston, and we met up here at their suggestion. Ordered the family pack of 6oz. lobster rolls for everyone, along with a large clam chowder. The food is excellent, the rolls are FILLED with yummy lobster--slightly more than advertised, and the soup is hearty and substantial. I'll make a note that I despise cole slaw in all forms, but the side provided here at Luke's is actually quite decent."
52,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,6/13/2021,Just moved to Boston and my goal is to find the best lobster roll. I got the 6 oz lobster roll...go big or go home. I added on their special that day which was truffle butter. The lobster was fresh and tasty! The roll wasn't doused in butter and didn't over power the taste of the seafood. This place tops it for me so far!
53,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,11/18/2021,Our first night in town and we were exhausted! So we ditched our into all dining out plans and ordered in from Luke's. The lobster roll was mouthwatering
54,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/1/2021,"Not that many people on Thursday night. No reservation and walk-in only. The Lobster roll tastes fresh and great! Lobster Mac & Cheese is also good, but I might just order the lobster roll when I come back."
55,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,11/17/2020,"*NEEDS CUSTOMERS SERVICE TRAINING*
Perhaps I went in on a bad time for the staff but my visit left me with a ""I don't know if I'll ever come back"" thought. I was so excited to try this spot, the lobster rolls are truly AMAZING. I entered Luke's happy, I said ""hi! Good afternoon"" to the 2 gentlemen who where behind the counter, none of them answered. The man who took my order was very short and overall looked as if he was in a crappy mood. There was no welcoming feeling, no ""hi"" no ""thank you"" nothing. A straight ""what are you going to order"" & ""your total is etc."" Would I come back? Maybe, (the rolls are delicious) but if I do, I will order pick up and save myself the awkward service."
56,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/10/2020,"I've been to Luke's lobsters now two times and we decided to go to the one in Back Bay for dine in because the other locations I believe are either temporarily closed due to covid and aren't accepting dine in services which makes sense because they are much smaller compared to the back bay location. 

The staff here was super nice and food came out in a reasonable time but we did order a lot so that's understandable. The food was super good and my partner is visiting from Arizona and loves the lobster rolls from here so I have to take him here everytime he is in town. We got the trio which was like half of a regular roll and was good and ended up ordering another roll because we were still hungry. I got the shrimp roll and he got the crab I believe."
57,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/11/2021,"Since we were visiting from California, Boston lobster roll was a must try dish on our list! We came across Luke's Lobster Back Bay as one of the most recommended places on yelp besides Pauli's in the north end. We decided to stop by for a quick lunch before heading to Cambridge across the bridge. I believe it's located on the street right behind Boston Public Library. We ordered 2 Regular size Lobster Rolls and they were so good!!! The lobster was cut in chunks coated in their flavorful seasonings along with melted butter on the side that made everything so delicious! The lobster was fresh and comparable to the ones we had in Maine. I have to say the best part was the bread/bun they used for the lobster rolls. It was so crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. We were totally impressed with the way this place made their buns. I highly recommended anyone who is visiting Boston to try this place! Unfortunately, we didnt get a chance to take pics because the lobster rolls were so delicious that we literally inhaled them in less than 15mins :)"
58,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,7/23/2021,"Truly enjoyed the Luke's trio (wow-- the shrimp was great). Priced fairly for the amount. Sadly, minus one star for the air conditioning not working- it was ungodly hot and very uncomfortable inside even with the doors open."
59,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,12/27/2021,"There are lobster rolls to be had all over the place (albeit much more expensive). Â 
Special here: I love their Jonah Crab roll. Â A delicacy. Â Reminds me of Dungeness on the West Coast. Â My only issue is the two sizes seem indistinguishable, imo. Â 
I submit that they would get a lot more customers if they somehow made themselves more visible to Boylston St, just the other side of the Lenox Hotel.
ETA: Almost forgot because I live nearby: There is live parking at most. Â But almost everyone I see there is walk-in.
One last thing: Testimonials to them are the brown bags with tags lined up on the counter."
60,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,11/13/2021,Best Lobster Roll in the world. Get it with truffle butter. Pass on the chowder though. Sorry but not so much.
61,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,9/28/2020,"Came here on National Lobster Day to try their lobster rolls. We overheard the person ahead of us order their roll with extra seasoning and decided to go down the same path and I'm really glad we did. The roll with extra seasoning was so tasty. We also tried both the bisque and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was rich and had a distinct seafood flavor that I liked. 

I've also listened to a podcast episode with the founders about how Luke's Lobster is supporting their workers like fishermen during this pandemic and I have to say they're doing an amazing job adapting and helping as many people as possible."
62,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,4/2/2021,Excellent chain in Boston and we love it here . Had several lobster and crab rolls and also had some soup as well. So good and we will for sure be back. Service was friendly and prices were reasonable.
63,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,11/1/2021,"Solid lobster roll and clam chowder. As with most chowder, this could use more meat but it has a good flavor. I'll deduct 1 Star for the price. Â $41 (including tip) for a small roll and chowder/no drink, is a little much considering it's basically a fast food joint- meaning not much atmosphere for eating in. Sure tasted good though."
64,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/5/2021,I used online ordering which was a breeze. This was my first experience having a lobster roll. Luke's did not disappoint. And to my surprise the lobster Mac and cheese was even better than I would have ever imagine. It's a must try.
65,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/6/2021,Wow! This place was amazing! I was in town for the day and can't wait to come back. I couldn't believe how much lobster was in my roll. Lukes's doesn't mess around! The clam chowder was also incredibly yummy! The slaw was great but after the chowder and lobster roll I had no room left for the slaw. Service was fast and very friendly! I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.
66,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/3/2021,Amazing! Best place to grab some great lobster or crab rolls. Very clean and friendly service.
67,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,11/20/2021,Delicious food and very friendly staff!! Definitely a must visit when in Boston. :) I highly recommend the lobster grilled cheese but the rolls are good too!

Below is a quick explanation of my rating mechanism:
1star: Absolutely horrible and will not come back under any circumstances 
2 stars: Way below my initial expectation with very few highlights. Will only come back to order specific courses if my friend strongly insist. Â 
3 stars: Average with some turn-offs. Might give it a second chance to test more dishes out. 
4 stars: Meets expectation with a couple highlights. Will come back. 
5 stars: Exceeds my expectation by various aspects. Will come back quite often and also recommend the place to my friends. 

An overdue review for my first lobster roll experience after moving to BOS this summer. It will prob serve as the benchmark of the many more lobster rolls to come in the near future. The restaurant offers limited dine-in and outside seating options. The credit card reader is placed on a stand in-between the customers and the cashier to create additional social distance. 

The interior of the restaurant is almost as simple as you couple imagine, which directly draws your attention to the menu above the open kitchen. The menu, again, is quite straightforward, which includes Lobster Combo, Crab Combo, Shrimp Combo, or Luke's Trio (which includes 1/3 of all the three options). One highlight is that for the drink included in the combo, you can pick whatever is available in the fridge (flavored sparkling water, soda, and other non-alcoholic drinks) with no additional cost. 
 
Luke's Trio with Coreslaw ($23): RECOMMEND
I have to say that it has exceeded my expectation (built from my limited experiences with lobster roll in other cities) for a chain restaurant. The rolls are loaded with seafood with minimum seasonings (sale, pepper, and butter on the interior of the rolls). The seafood all tastes fresh and sweet and no scent of fishy taste from the shrimps at all. The lobster roll is my personal favorite among the three, so I will likely get a full-length lobster roll next time but really you can't go wrong with any of the three. 

My only complaint would be the portion size as I feel I can easily finish another roll for lunch. Other than that, it's been really everything I can expect from my first lobster roll experience here. Â Will certainly come back again."
69,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,1/9/2020,"One of my to go spots when I'm in Boston, they are good quick and delicious. Every time I have visited Boston I come to Luke's. They don't disappoint. They have a good atmosphere and centrally located. The quality is really good as well, and the staff is amazing, sweet and helpful! 

If you're looking for a quick bite but also something that good and very delicious this is the spot. I usually get the hot lobster roll because it's buttery and delicious and my boyfriend likes the cold lobster roll which is also mouth-watering. Their clam chowder soup is also one of my favorites with a side of chip I am in heaven, writing this review is making me crave them and want a roll. Soon I will be back!"
70,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,12/9/2019,"I came here twice within three days. 
It's a little pricey but they really give you a lot of lobster Â meat in your lobster rolls. And they're freaking delicious. 
You order and sit down and they bring out the food for you. 
No fountain drinks- just bottled drinks. If you ordered a drink with your meal, you just grab the drink in the fridge. 
I really wanted to try their three sandwich combo but I can't eat a lot so I just stuck with the lobster roll combo. 
Whatever you do, get the soup and sandwich combo. I tried both the bisque and the chowder. Chowder obviously has potatoes and clam in the soup but the bisque is just the soup itself with nothing else in it. 
The second time I went, they made a mistake and brought the wrong soup and the server was kind enough to bring me the right one. Ended up not eating it because I found hair :( 
Anyway- definitely worth it if you're in town!"
71,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,8/29/2020,"I wanted to like this place so bad! I have tried two different locations in New York City and I had always thought they were pretty good. I mean to give them credit, we had just gotten lobster rolls and clam chowder from Quincy market just a few hours earlier.

Their lobster rolls are all right, But my favorite from Luke's lobster has always been their crab rolls. Don't get their lobster bisque! It is way too salty and rich."
72,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,7/27/2020,I went in there and it was shockingly quiet due to the effects of covid. it was just simply empty and they had a couple of pickups you're in there. But I went in with my family and ordered the $65 lobster roll special (four lobster rolls) and clam chowder. It was so good and it's always been a very busy place so I never really bothered coming in. but I'm happy to say that the food was delicious and if anybody's around the back Bay they should pop in. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.
73,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,12/25/2019,"Great quick spot when you want a fresh bite. Stopped here with my parents after enjoying the library and they loved it. We had the clam chowder, lobster rolls and the Mac and cheese. All super good and well worth the price. My dad said he usually doesn't like lobster, but loved this! Way to go! Must of been the toasted bun they served the lobster on. Toasted to perfection. 
Service was fast and super friendly considering it took us a while to decide what to get. Glad for their patience. 
And the bathrooms were nice and clean-thank you! Definitely will come back."
74,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,6/4/2021,I got the Luke's Trio! I'm gluten free so I asked for the Gf Bread (which was honestly one of the best GF breads I've ever had). They asked at the counter whether it was an allergy or a preference as they would put it on a separate grill depending on if it was an allergy.
75,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,2/2/2020,"Really cute place! Came here to get the classic lobster roll, and it was pretty good! Well toasted bread, butter, and fresh lobster. We also got the combo and tried both the lobster bisque and the clam chowder. Both were decent, but I liked the clam chowder better. 

The service here was really great though! I also liked how the combo came with cute drinks (I got a blueberry wildflower honey lemonade). I feel like definitely a staple for the Boston experience."
76,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,1/25/2021,"This place is awesome! The service is a little slow but the attention to quality and presentation makes up for it. As an Arizona native I never knew what a good lobster roll tasted like until I took a trip to Boston. Luke's is easily the most delicious, pure, and simple seafood restaurants that I have ever been to. The ingredients are light and they really let you appreciate the natural flavor of the seafood."
77,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,8/27/2020,"Apparently I've never had a ""real"" crab roll because this was one of the tastiest rolls I've ever had. Â The seasoning was perfect, the crab was so tender but definitely not overcooked and the butter roll that it was on was so buttery. Â I really wanted a second one but that would have been greedy. Â I also had the lobster bisque. Â My only complaint is that I would've loved a little more lobster in my bisque but the flavor was perfect. Â We also had the shrimp roll and slaw. Â I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves a good seafood roll. Â I'll definitely be back."
78,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,5/18/2021,The food was pretty good. I think the atmosphere was a little bit awkward. I chose this place because of their reviews & I'm not totally sure I was steered in the right direction but it was good enough.
79,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,9/17/2019,"Hanging out around the Fenway area, I was looking for a Lobster roll, so my friend recommended Luke's which was his go-to. After going, I can see why. The concept is simple where you just order and within several minutes your food is ready to go. I'm okay with this since I don't need to go to a nice place and pay extra when I'm just eating a sandwich. 

With that being said, I think Luke's offers a reasonable price for Lobster rolls especially for the area and they also offer different sizes that are priced accordingly. The lobster meat was juicy and succulent and was just what I needed. I also went with the clam chowder which was pretty good, but honestly kind of expensive for a small cup.

Nonetheless, I liked the quick service and fresh seafood options so I'd recommend it to anyone in the area who's on a quest to find a great lobster roll."
80,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,6/4/2021,Had a craving for lobster rolls and this place really hit the spot. We dined in and the place was clean and spotless. The person who served us was patient and nice while we figured out what we wanted. The food came out very quickly too. I ordered the lobster roll with the chip and drink(got sea salt chips and root beer) while my boyfriend ordered the crab roll. Both were amazing and we can't wait to go back to the trio roll!
81,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,9/11/2019,"Ok.. When I write this review, I am not trying to be rude or anything but I really did feel confused when I came here. 

Our trip was coming to an end and thought we would swing by here since it had such good reviews. We've been in Boston for 5 days now and we have already tried two different Lobster Rolls at two different spots. Both spots did not impress us at all since we've heard nothing but amazing things about these lobster rolls that are famous in Boston.

I walked in and thought the decor was very inviting. I took a look at the menu and there wasn't much there to read, only a few items to choose from. I ordered the Lobster combo (comes with a side of Soup and a drink), price was $27. There was an option to upgrade to the ""Jumbo Roll"" for an extra $6.50. My wife never likes to eat an entire sandwich and thought it would be perfect for us to split (she would eat half and I would eat the other). SOOO I upgraded to ""Jumbo Roll""... Man, was I disappointed with what they brought out. They brought out the same size sandwich I had at the other two spots. So, of course I had to ask if this was correct. They told me that was in fact the ""jumbo roll"". I kept thinking to myself, no way in the world this could be it, it was the same damn size. 

What it boiled down to was the ""normal"" size is about half the bread and only 4 ounces of Lobster. The jumbo size (normal to me) was the normal size bread (about two inches bigger), and it comes with 2 more ounces of meat, totally 6 ounces of Lobster. No where in this place is this explained nor are there any examples of sizes for which these come in when you order. My wife and I would have never ordered the jumbo if we had even the slightest clue. 

Lesson learned I guess..... Wife ended up ordering a large portion of Clam Chowder for $10.. $10!!!! I understand Boston is known for the sea food and such, but hot damn that was expensive for a little bit larger than a cup of clam chowder. Either way, she ordered it and ate it. It was good (I had the smaller portion with my combo). 

We ended up spending $47 for what appeared to be a semi-fast food restaurant. I am not too worried about the money but wasn't expecting that what so ever. 

I gave them 3 stars because even though the sandwich wasn't what I considered to be ""Jumbo"", it was the best one I had in Boston!!

I just feel maybe they could be a bit better in explaining exactly what ""jumbo"" means on their menu. And I feel their prices are a bit higher all around. Â 

If you're looking for Clam Chowder, order it at a restaurant and its going to be better quality and a couple dollars cheaper (depending on the dining place of course, fine dining which Lukes Lobster is not, it will probably be around the same price or more). 

If you're looking for one of the best Lobster Rolls I've tasted (that's a total of 3 my entire life LOL), come here and get the Roll ONLY!!"
82,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,7/17/2021,"Excellent lobster roll and bisques. Â Good size and price, and the taste was excellent. Â Nice combo meal options as well, and an option to increase the size of the rolls."
83,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,9/20/2021,"I've been to this location a few times now and it's always been a pleasant experience. I go for the Luke's trio which is so delicious! The portion size is a bit small and it's a bit on the pricier side, but the food melts in your mouth and you can tell it's great quality seafood, so it's worth it!"
84,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,7/4/2021,"Delicious food, friendly staff, cozy setting with 4 tables, and bar table against the wall, about ~20 people at full capacity! Only point taken off was due to higher price, Lobster/crab/shrimp trio $23 ( small 1/3 roll each with a lot of meat) clam chowder large $9.5, plus taxes and tips, I spent $40 for 1 person. Yet the experience was pleasant nonetheless!"
85,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,1 star rating,1/23/2022,Sorry- the people were nice but food was really horrible. Tasteless.. lobster Mac and cheese was horrible.
86,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,9/24/2019,"I have been on a journey to find Boston's best lobster roll. I had to stop at Luke's.

The ambiance is casual but you will see various professionals who stop in on their break to have a lobster roll. The service is great and the people are very knowledgeable about their menu.

I had the lobstah roll, clam chowdah and a raspberry lemonade. I read a review where someone said the clam chowder wasn't great. My tip is to ask for a sample before you buy. I tasted it before I ordered and it was amazing! The lobster roll was ok, not my favorite. I'm not sure if there is a 'warm' option but I didn't particularly like the cold lobster roll taste paired with a very warm chowder. 

I would go again, but not for a cold lobster roll."

88,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,7/31/2019,"Great Lobster Rolls and soups right off Boylston in Boston. Despite being a more commercialized national chain restaurant, the quality at Luke's was very impressive. 

Came in for lunch and went with a lobster roll and lobster bisque; this combo came with a soda but was a bit pricey at around $25. 

The lobster roll was delicious, full of nice chunks of lobster, flavored nicely and with the bun buttered perfectly. My lobster bisque wasn't bad either and my wife's clam chowder was also tasty and highly enjoyed. Luke's has some cool bottled soda's as well, with the Blueberry Lemonade being my recommendation. 

Luke's prides themselves on offering ""traceable"" seafood and display where the current crustaceans originated. Staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean and most importantly the food was good quality."
89,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,2 star rating,9/22/2021,"I don't think their seafood is fresh. The lobster roll has shredded meat, unlike the other places which normally have lobster chunks. The Mayo and seasoning covers any lobster taste."
