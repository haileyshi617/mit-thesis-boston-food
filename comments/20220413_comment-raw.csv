0,0,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,2/25/2022,"Service: 
We went as a group of 4 on a weekend but early in the day and were able to sit immediately. 
We were welcomed as soon as we walked in and the staff was beyond patient in describing the menu options and vegan options too!

Inside:
As soon as you walk in the amazing smells of fresh and delicious ramen overwhelmed the entrance and if I wasn't already, it sure would've made me instantly hungry!
Their decor and painted walls are super cool the music played in the background makes it a nice and casual eatery.

Ramen: 
Delicious, savory fresh and you can watch them prep it! 
Big portions you could easily split or take home for later!"
1,1,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,4/1/2022,"Happy to see a vegan ramen place. Boston has a lot of popular ramen joints but most of them don't offer a broth for vegetarians/vegan. Red white ramen is building up on that space by providing a number of vegan ramen. 

My favorites:
Tokyo Masala - Mildly Spicy. it brought out the flavors of the Indian sun-continent and reminded me of a popular noodle back in India. Loved it to every bit. Loved the way you could customize your ramens. If you are not a fan of bamboo, you could probably avoid them. 

Sesame ramen - Not for spice lovers. This one had a strong taste of sesame to each mouth. 

PROS: 
# heart of newbury street
# quick serving of the order 
# ample parking space 
# ample dining area 

CONS:
# not an eco-friendly place 
# plastic spoons, plastic forks, plastic chopsticks, paper ramen bowl."
2,2,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,1/17/2022,"So this is not traditional ramen. This has been heavily Americanized with cheese in it as well as loads of vegan and vegetarian options. Take that for what you will but I wasn't a fan. The flavor tasted fattening and bland. The name serves it right though, this is the kind of place you go to after a baseball game when you just need food and don't really care what it is. 

In Boston there is a wealth of Japanese Ramen spots that are keen to challenge your palette and present you with bold and well catered flavors. This just isn't one of the places. This flys in the face of what ramen should be, it isn't healthy, and it is clearly trying far too hard to be liked by the american sports crowd and masses walking past their Newbury location. 

Packaging feels like thought went into it at first glance but once you feel it it's cheap and flimsy. Not to mention it features quite a lot of plastic including a plastic coating around the bowl."
3,3,RED WHITE RAMEN,1 star rating,1/8/2022,"I was on a vegetarian ramen kick so when I saw this vegan ramen place I had to try it in hopes to find a vegan ramen that I could love. After eating at Red White I have to say I won't be back. I can deal when the food is ugly yet delicious but when it's both ugly and not delicious then I have a problem. 

The one dish I had the most problem with was the  MASTERPIECE ""Creamy Sesame Taste"". The broth as you continued to eat it was getting darker and darker, it was so unappealing. I think it was due to the black sesame and the mushrooms in the broth that made the broth turn dark. And there was too many toppings which turned out to be way overwhelming and it just didn't taste good overall. The fact it came in a paper container everything was a pile on top of each other and it became a bowl of mush. Ramen should be in a porcelain bowl PERIOD! Not in this ice cream container.

I also ordered the BUDDHA RICE with Roasted Miso Avocado. The only thing that tasted good was the roasted miso avocado. As for the rice itself it was a hodgepodge of rice and veggies, which I wanted sushi rice vinegar to season the mish mosh of rice and veggies. It wasn't anything delightful tasting really. However, it was definitely better tasting than the ramen I had. The hunt continues to find a vegan ramen I love."
4,4,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,12/27/2021,"It was cold out and my group was going to walk around and venture out to see some of Boston. I wanted something warm and found this Japanese Ramen place that's vegan. 
This place is small, has cute decor and service was fast. As you walk in there's a counter to place your order and pay. Once the order is ready, they call out your name to come pick it up. I had questions about the menu and the person at the counter took his time to explain to us about the options. 
The ramen was really good. The portions are big and filling or even shareable. We took one to go and they pack it up very well. 
It's definitely a place I'd go back to when I go back and visit again."
5,5,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,10/20/2021,"My friend and I came here to try this place thinking it was vegan friendly and we were not disappointed. I was in a bit of shock when the worker here told me everything is vegan (hooray for me) but not for long as they have so many flavors to choose from. I must say: these were the best noodles I have ever eaten. They were perfectly chewy and slurpable. We are still talking about it. 

They bring your food outside if you manage to snag a seat and are quite fast. I definitely recommend the masterpiece if you like sesame. The Sapporo broth was ok. I wouldn't have minded more ginger. The meat sub they use is pretty good but I wish it were sliced larger so it didn't sink to the bottom of the bowl. All in all, solid, affordable, delicious noodles."
6,6,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/13/2021,"Red White has some amazing ramen. But what's truly incredible is that it's all vegan. I grew up on ramen. Ramen is my comfort food. I know ramen. And let me tell you, I almost fainted from delight, their ramen was so good.

Bring all your friends here. Even meat-eater types. They won't even notice that there's no meat in here. The flavor is packed with umami. And rather than the standard toppings, they go with mushrooms, corn, and spinach -- and they work really well.

I thought I'd give this place a try because I was in town for the marathon, and I was trying to figure out how I could manage to eat a vegan ramen -- and this place was recommended to me by a friend of mine. So glad she did. I was here for four days, and you wanna know how often I ate here? FOUR TIMES.

I had their Sapporo Buddha, which has a really rich miso broth. Then on day 2, I brought a former colleague of mine for lunch, and we both had the Buddha Rice bowls. I figured I'd try something a little different. So glad I did, because that dish is crazy good. Do NOT be lulled into thinking it's just another power grain bowl. It's very rich in flavor and texture. Plus, the avocado with baked miso on top is just to die for. It just takes it to a whole 'nother level.

Day 3 was race day. That's right. After I ran 26.2 miles for a marathon, I walked the four blocks over, still wearing my mylar blanket, to this place, so I could take a bowl of ramen back to my hotel room to enjoy. Even after I showered and the soup wasn't super hot anymore, it was just as rewarding. I actually started thinking about it in the last miles of the race!

The last order was another Buddha Rice bowl, which I bought to take with me on my flight home. So glad I did. It was MUCH better than airline food.

Wish they had a Red White near my place (in SF Bay Area). Well maybe not. That would be dangerous. Because I'd want to eat there all the time.

Bottom line: Even if you eat meat, go check out Red White Buddha Ramen. These guys are making some amazing noodle bowls. I know there are some other popular ramen places near Back Bay (with way longer lines) but I'd recommend you try this place.

A couple of tips: The place is right on Newbury, but like a lot of places, the indoor dining and ordering counter are down a flight of stairs. There are several indoor tables, but the air circulation is pretty good, and the tables turn over pretty quickly. They also have outdoor seating in a ""parklet"" right in front of their establishment. ALL food is served in to-go containers regardless of whether you dine in or not. But the best part, if you order it to go, is their packaging. The soup is in the actual bowl portion, but they use a really clever lid that comes in two pieces: They nest like a regular clamshell container, and when you snap the two lid parts together, you also get to snap it on top of the soup bowl. That way, the noodles don't get soft until you're ready to mix it into the soup. Genius!

GO EAT HERE. You will NOT regret it. Trust me, next time I'm in Bahst'n, I WILL be eating here again. And again."
7,7,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,12/28/2021,"honestly a BOMB ramen place.

we ordered the dragon breath and it was so good. the spice comes from habanero pepper smashed on the side so you can add the spice to your liking. also, since its habanero, it doesn't alter the flavor, but gives it quite a kick. the noodles were chewy and thick and the soup was thiccc as well. the mushrooms inside were nicely marinated and it was really good :)"
8,8,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,4/5/2022,The Tokyo Masala was an interesting fusion. Very tasty.  It was also better when they let you choose the individual ingredients. The tables are too small and uncomfortable.
9,9,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,8/31/2021,"Stopped by for lunch while shopping on Newbury and ate one of the most delicious bowls of vegetarian ramen I've ever had. The porcini broth was creamy and flavorful with sesame and chili. The noodles had a nice chewy texture that complemented the broth well. The toppings also went well with everything else in the bowl. 

The ramen was priced well at about $12 and it came out pretty fast in a to-go container that I ate inside. The place was clean as well. I definitely want to come back and try their other ramens and with cheese topping too!"
10,10,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,9/30/2021,"Came here on a Sunday morning. Your order is placed at the front and then can sit inside or outside. You have the option or grabbing the food or they will bring the food out to you. Take out is also an option as they have a shelf set up right next to the door for convenient grab and go style. 

I tried the dragon breath ""special"" which included fried onions and cheese. It was pretty salty so I added a fair amount of water to dilute the broth which wasn't a problem since I usually enjoy more broth anyways. The Ramen itself was a little bit more firm than I am used to. However, I also prefer undercooked rather than over. Given that the dish was entirely vegan, I was surprised at the depth and umami flavors. I appreciated the toppings offered as it provided varied taste and texture each bite. 

Service was friendly and I will definitely come again. Prices are a little high but expected given the location and quality of the food. Not to mention being entirely plant-based!"
11,11,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,12/21/2021,"I really wanted to like this place after seeing all the great reviews. I came here, hopeful, and was greeted warmly by the man working at the front and he helped give us recommendations. I got the Buddha's bowl and my friend got the Masterpiece. The food came out within 10 minutes, which was nice because we were starving after walking around Newbury all day. 

After taking the first sip, we were immediately taken aback by how bad it was. The broth was super thick and lacked any kind of flavor. It tasted like someone boiled an onion, threw in some veggies/noodles, and called it a day. Neither of us ended up finishing the ramen. I forced myself to eat a few bites before I physically could not eat any more, which is saying a lot because I am the equivalent of a human trash can. The ramen just looks and tastes so sad in comparison to all the photos and reviews on here."
12,12,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,9/28/2021,"Whoever said the Dragon Breath was disappointingly not spicy must actually be a dragon, because there's no way it can be considered ""not spicy"". As an avid lover of spicy food, I tasted the capsaicin before the noodles even reached my mouth. This felt like fire noodles, except the effects don't creep up on you- they come immediately.

Crazy spice aside (which is exactly what they advertised), the ramen is just alright. Loved the chewy semi-firm texture and the broth is good. Not as rich as non-vegan ramen, but that's to be expected. I'm a bit disappointed with the narrow disposable bowls for dining in and the lack of substantial toppings, but it's a solid choice for vegan ramen!"
13,13,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,12/20/2021,"Vegan ramen that actually tastes like ramen and not watered down broth. It is very much an eat and go kind of setting but that not surprising as it is decorated and set up to be like ramen-ya back in Japan .

The staff are great and the food is too. It's one of the few places I'm willing to travel to eat at.

I always order extra toppings because I'm a glutton."
14,14,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,12/9/2021,"We were chilled and decided that hot soup was the right answer for lunch. I ordered the Masterpiece, A ordered the Special.
The seating area is no-frills, but sufficient for consuming a (disposable) bowl of soup.
At first, I was not impressed with the flavors and consistency of my Masterpiece...but a short time later I had a complete change of heart and realized that it was actually very good...really.  A loved her Special.
On a chilly day I would go back."
15,15,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,4/2/2022,"Decent flavor but overall it wasn't satisfying ramen. I got the truffle flavor and the smell was pretty overbearing from the start. Also the tofu/meat that comes with the ramen had a strange texture. There's no option to add an egg or charshiu like other restaurants, it seems like most of the food served here is takeout. Overall, wouldn't consider this a ramen place and both my friend and I didn't end up finishing our noodles."
16,16,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,6/30/2021,"Ordered the Dragon Breath ramen with crispy onions via doordash. (They also had a deal for 20% off orders $15 or more, up to a $5 discount)

Food was DELICIOUS. I'm always hesitant about ordering ramen for take out but it was still hot and everything was packaged really well. The broth had so much umami flavors that my only regret was not purchasing more broth on the side.  I really like spicy food and didn't think the Dragon Breath was that spicy - but it has a slight kick and was full of flavor. Would HIGHLY recommend."
17,17,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,12/12/2021,"New favorite spot for ramen! We stopped by Red White on Newbury for lunch on Saturday and had a great time! It looks like they do a lot of delivery but they also had a handful of tables where you could seat yourself. We ordered at the counter then sat at a table until they called our name, we went around 1pm and while all the seats were being used there was a ton of turnover so no one waited for a table. We got the truffle and classic miso ramens which were phenomenal! Both came with corn, spinach, mushrooms and tofu... they're all vegan!! We also tried the miso avocado which Id recommend if you love miso! Very reasonably priced and they get your food to you quickly. We had a great time and will be back."
18,18,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,2/17/2022,"Great ramen spot! They have just a few choices for the ramen and that's kind of nice because it is not overwhelming to decide. I had the Masterpiece ramen with the Special topping (which comes with shredded cheese and crispy onion). The ramen itself was great, I liked the umami flavor and the nice texture of the noodles. It was a very filling lunch without being overly heavy. Next time I would likely not get the special topping, it's an extra $3 for a little bit of cheese and crispy onion topping and I feel like there was not a lot of added flavor that made the dish significantly better for me, so I would say the special is not worth it."
19,19,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,5/15/2021,"The food at this vegan restaurant was surprisingly delicious. Not only was the broth flavorful, but the well integrated elements of each part in the ramen truly elevated the whole dish to another level. It didn't taste fake or lacking in anyway. To be honest I probably wouldn't have even known there were no animal products in the ramen had I not known in advance. 

The staff was extraordinarily helpful and kind. They explained the differences of each dish on the menu and made the food in a timely manner. Would totally come again."
20,20,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,3/1/2022,"Great option for a vegan ramen! The broth is creamy and thick compared to traditional ramen, noodles were great but I was not floored by the flavor but would definitely have it again. Giving it 3/5 stars because I've had much more flavorful vegetarian/vegan ramen so there's definitely room for improvement! Btw seating is limited*"
21,21,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,4/25/2021,"Would recommend this place if you're looking for fast casual, filling meal in the area! 

I didn't know that the food was vegan, but I was pretty impressed with the protein replacements actually. I got the Masterpiece ramen which had a creamy sesame broth that was tasty. Overall, pretty good for fast casual food. Not the best ramen in the world, but definitely great value for what I got - $11 a bowl. Everything else on Newbury St is so pricy, so it was perfect to find this place! As a non-vegan, definitely missed having the meat in my ramen :/ 

They have two outdoor tables for people to eat at, and a couple indoor that were available too. The staff were very friendly and explained the different menu options as it was my first time there. The food came out very fast, and portions were very filling."
22,22,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,9/21/2021,"Because of the raving review, I was stoked to try this place, especially because it's walking distance to me. Service is awesome & my takeout order was ready quick and packed perfectly. But the food here just isn't for me. 

I got the Sapporo Buddha, the only good thing about it was the noodles. For the first time ever, I dumped a whole ramen dish in the trash; it was painful to do. It was beyond salty and made it inedible. I know miso is salty, but this wasn't my first ramen.. so I know it can be delicious. 

I also got the Buddha rice. It was okay, the miso avocado was delicious and that's about it. End of the story, I pretty much dumped $30 into the trash & wasted food."
23,23,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,3/21/2022,I went here today and I was quite disappointed.  I ordered the masterpiece which came in a paper take-out container.  I guess taking pictures from directly on top makes it look like a real ramen bowl.  I was also hoping to get a beer like you would get in a real ramen place.  But the real problem with this was that it was bitter.  The soup flavor was bitter.  Aside from that some of the ingredients were cold.  I guess this place is the Chipotle of ramen.
24,24,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,9/23/2021,"I don't know what it is about Newbury, but I feel like the people who review restaurants here have never eaten anywhere else.  It's like ""OMG this place puts its food on plates, 5 stars!"" Really, Dunkin Donuts is like 5 stars on Newbury and 3 on Boylston.  You get what you pay for.

I mean, except on Newbury.  In which case you get an absolute generic paper bowl filled with nonsense for $16.  I mean, it's not bad, but what I ended up with was a whole lot of noodles, a few mushrooms and a metric ton of corn.  I'm not one to point people at Santouka, but for $16 they give you some pork, at least.  The broth was...okay, but ramen, in my (meager) experience is supposed to be this thick porky sludge that has so much complexity to it your mouth just kind of gives up and is like ""yeah, pleasure, whatever"".  This was...just okay.

But maybe I got the wrong thing.  People are ranting about the vegetarian ramen which sounds like an oxymoron to me, but hey.  It's Newbury.  Anything goes.  And then gets 5 stars.

Service was really nice, though."
25,25,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,1/16/2022,"I haven't been to a place that has all-vegan ramen  in two years. This really made me the happiest I have been in so long! I got their basic one, the Masterpiece which has tofu bits, mushrooms , spinach, and corn  The broth is sesame-based. The noodles were how I like them, thick and chewy, and all the toppings were fresh and that broth tho  If you're ever in Boston, check out Red White in the Back Bay Area"
26,26,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/1/2021,"RED WHITE packs the savory flavor - appealing to ramen lovers everywhere and particularly any prior victim of a bland vegetarian broth! Every bowl includes fresh spinach, mushroom, corn, tofu, soy meat, and perfectly cooked ramen in your choice of satisfying broth. I loved the King & Queen - its rich aroma  and almost creamy truffle taste made it the best ramen bowl I've ever had. The Miso Avocado was definitely an acquired taste, but if you love either of those flavors you might be really into it.

The friendly staff, ambiance, and cozy Newbury location (with patio!) only add to RED WHITE's greatness. I really hope you come here and experience the same umami joy ride as I did!"
27,27,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,2/16/2022,EXCELLENT vegan ramen!! Perfect for meat eaters because they don't advertise as a vegan ramen shop but everything is and it's so cute and casual on the inside. Every time I go the chefs are working so hard and you can see them putting so much love into their creations. They deserve 10/5 stars.
28,28,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,11/16/2021,"This place blew me away! My mom and I came here for dinner after an eventful day of exploring the city and this was just what we needed to more than satisfy our hungry bellies! 
We shared the masterpiece creamy sesame ramen and the buddha rice bowl with roasted miso avocado. Both were extremely delicious but the latter really just stole the show... and my heart. The creamy avocado with the fire-roasted miso glaze... my tastebuds were dancing with every single bite and I never wanted it to end!! 

If you're ever in the area, you need to come here and experience the magic that I experienced with this miso glazed avocado buddha bowl! You won't regret ittt!!! 

Also the ambiance was nice and the service was great!"
29,29,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,8/13/2021,"The hype is so real.

I've been to tons of vegan ramen places all over SoCal and the Bay Area, and quite frankly they're all pretty disappointing. Especially when compared to some of the vegan ramen places I've went to in Japan which have been life-changingly incredible, they just can't stack up.

So as a semi-experienced vegan ramen orderer, I have to say that Red White is honestly comparable with the vegan ramen I've had in Japan. The sesame broth was incredibly flavorful and the toppings are all really tasty and meat-like too. Would really recommend upgrading and getting the cheese and crispy onions. Price is overall pretty affordable too, I remember it being like $13 plus tax for a bowl. Small disclaimer, I would suggest not ordering the ""Mix Well"" dry ramen (it's kind of just like the sesame ramen just without that delicious broth) or the Dragon's Breath (it's kind of more a dry heat without as much flavor as you'd hope for)."
30,30,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,9/16/2021,"It's not easy finding vegan ramen, so this place is special! Located on Newbury street and down some steps, this quaint little shop has a variety of ramen options. You enter inside, order, and pay upfront. Then, they either call your name or bring your order out to you. There is intimate indoor seating and some outdoor seating too. The cashier was awesome. Very quick to give recommendations based on our preferences and very funny as well. I ordered the Masterpiece because he gave a convincing pitch for it. It was great! Good contrast of veggies and noodles, and the broth tasted solid too. Not very photogenic, but the flavor made up for it. As a non-vegan, I still enjoyed it thoroughly. Would definitely come here again!"
31,31,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,10/21/2021,"Stunning VEGAN ramen and rice bowls 

I tried the King and Queen (truffle flavor) ramen and highly recommend! 

The broth is rich. Noodles chewy. Toppings (corn, mushrooms, spinach, and tofu) filling. Did I mention it is Vegan?? Which I am not..  but it is lovely to see delicious meat- free options."
32,32,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,3/19/2022,"Loved the dragon breath soup, dined in, I have found my comfort food in Boston, this was my first visit at a vegan Japanese restaurant. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu while I am in Boston"
33,33,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,3/28/2021,"Firstly, I really appreciate the fact that this restaurant's entire menu is vegetarian. It makes dining out very easy especially when people have different dietary restrictions in a friend group. 

My boyfriend and I tried the Sapporo Ramen and the Dragon Breath Ramen. Between the two I definitely preferred the Sapporo Ramen. I found the broth with the mix of the ingredients worked well in this bowl, whereas I didn't find that the spice in the Dragon Breath Bowl was fully incorporated in the broth. I enjoyed the flavor of the Sapporo Ramen and especially liked the chewy texture of the noodles. 

I would love to come back and try some of their other options!"
34,34,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,12/10/2021,Working in the city and I was craving ramen. This restaurant came up and I decided to check it out. From the time I walked in the service was great! I told them it was my first time and they took me through the menu and flavors and customer favorites. The first bowl I got was the Masterpiece and boy was it delicious! I was in heaven. Portion size was amazing too. Before I left I got my husband a bowl of the dragons breath which we ate later that night. Wow spicy but oh so good. A must try when in Boston.
35,35,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,3/13/2022,"If you are vegan or vegetarian, you will definitely appreciate the delicious ramen at Red White, but even if you are not, try it! The aromatic, spicy umami of the Tokyo ramen won over the meat eater among us. Those in our party who went for traditional Sapporo ramen were also pleased. The service is speedy and friendly. The owner and staff are so nice and they have cheerfully decorated the lower-floor restaurant in Japanese murals and origami paper. We got take out this time and it was nice and hot and very carefully packed."
36,36,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,2/20/2022,"tastes like vegan ramen

Came here with the vegetarian friend although I am not vegan myself, we thought it would be interesting to try out. I was skeptical because I feel that the rich pork broth in traditional ramen would be difficult (or perhaps impossible to replace). I am a big fan of umami flavors so I got the King&Queen with extra noodles (because I was super hungry that day). First off, I was blown away on how packed the ramen was - the bowl must have weighed over a pound. A ton of food. Def didn't need to get the extra noodles haha. The ramen itself was okay. Unfortunately, I did not like the broth that much but this may be because I am so used to pork broth. The saltiness is the first thing that hits you but there was no richness to back it up. Tasted similar to instant ramen broth. The noodles were also disappointing. They were very soggy (whereas I like the ramen noodles that are slippery and pick up the broth flavor on the outside while maintaining their integrity). Overall, it was an interesting ramen experience but not my cup of tea. I guess it is a decent alternative to traditional ramen, especially to those with dietary restrictions. But head to head, it does not compare.

We also got the miso avocado appetizer and it was underwhelming as well. Tasted exactly what it looks like - super concentrated miso (very salty) on top of avocado. When miso is served this concentrated, it has a funk to it that I did not like."
37,37,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,12/28/2021,"This vegan Ramen spot in Boston is incredible!
The flavors were absolutely delicious, the concept is forward and sustainable, and I'm telling you this place is a must!
We got: 
-Masterpiece Ramen
-Buddha Rice 
-Roasted Miso Avocado- one of the best things I've tasted! 

I can't wait to go back! And what a  great location- right on Newbury street!"
38,38,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,7/5/2021,"For vegan ramen, this place was pretty good. I got the dragon breath regular ramen and it came out to be around $13. For spice level, I didn't think it was that spicy but the flavor was good. It came with spinach, corn, and mushrooms on top. The tofu was kind of crumbled into the soup which was a little strange, and there was also a little bit of other fake meat in the soup. Overall, portion size was filling and came hot! This is more of a fast service place where you place an order with the cashier then pick it up when it's ready and sit down. Definitely doesn't taste like classic pork ramen but hit the spot on a rainy day."

40,40,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,11/29/2021,"I really really wanted a bowl of ramen after reading reviews about this place. I was so delighted to learn they had a gluten-free Ramen option! Unfortunately I am allergic to fructans, so no garlic or onions for me either. Sadly the Ramen broth contains garlic. I was thankful that there was one entrée option to suit my dietary restrictions. The sushi rice wine bowl from the photograph looked like it was packed full of delicious veggies. Unfortunately when I got it back to my hotel it was mostly rice, kale and ginger, there were two cherry tomato halves in the entire bowl. The miso avocado was tasty, but the bowl just lacked pizzaz, especially for the $12 price. 
The service was fast and friendly, and the location convenient."
41,41,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/1/2021,"I'm not a ramen connoisseur, but I am vegan, which makes me 50% representative of Red White's demographic. With that grain of salt, this was really, really good ramen. It wasn't overly salty or flavorless like other reviewers said, but rich, savory, and creamy (I got the sesame one). The vegetables tasted fresh and the noodles were hearty, but not overwhelming. It struck that perfect balance between comfort food and healthy food. Great value for price, too - it came in a really big container."
42,42,RED WHITE RAMEN,1 star rating,11/9/2021,"I got the special dragon breath ramen which, according to the employees, ""a little spicier"".  They clearly had no idea what they were saying because It was WAY too spicy, to the point it's not edible.  It was also very bitter, like soap. Had to throw out the whole thing.

At first this place was run by people who clearly cared about the restaurant- very friendly and knowledgeable, etc.  Sad to see this place deteriorate already in terms of service and quality."

44,44,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,1/30/2021,"My favorite spot in Boston! Love their tasty ramen and rice bowls. My favorite are mix well ramen and Buddha rice bowl. Super delicious and healthy. The Buddha rice bowl literally comes with  over 8 ingredients. Mix it up with their seaweed sauce, divine. 

I often come here to pickup the ramen to go. Eaten here during my first time with a friend and my husband. I've been back here over a dozen times and it's always super simple and quick to pickup. The staff are super friendly on top of the yummy vegan food."
45,45,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,2/16/2021,"I'd highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a quick bowl of ramen in Back Bay. They have a small indoor seating section with socially distanced tables. The staff were extremely friendly, and I was served in under 10 minutes!

I had the Dragon Breath Ramen, which was amazing. A bit on the spicier side, but this was perfect for me. The noodles had a good bite, and although I don't usually eat vegetarian I didn't miss the meat here one bit. The broth is star of the show here though, and I could've drank a bowl of that on its own!"
46,46,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,9/25/2021,"Ramen is a favorite, and so i wanted to see what they had to offer.  They have a different style, so if you are looking for  traditional, this may not be the place.  The food is still good and the server - Louis, was super friendly."
47,47,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,9/9/2021,"My friends and I were looking for a good ramen place in Boston and found this restaurant. I tried the Dragon Breath and it was a solid ramen. The broth was full of flavor and there was a good kick of spice. It's disappointing when a restaurant advertises a ""spicy"" dish, but it doesn't end up being spicy. However, the Dragon's Breath offers a flavorful spice; it's not spicy enough that you'll need to run to get some milk, but an enjoyable spice. I was hesitant at first when I saw the ramen since it came in togo containers, but the ramen was still steaming hot and delicious when I ate it. The noodles were firm with a nice bounce to it. There wasn't much toppings, but I didn't mind since the noodles with the broth tasted so good. I would definitely recommend trying this place if you're looking for some ramen."
48,48,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,9/6/2021,"my friends and i decided to stop by this place yesterday for lunch and we had a great time! this restaurant is relatively small and located underneath some steps, so they're quite easy to miss if you're just walking by.
-you can order for delivery or pick up through their website.
-there were a couple of tables set up outside on the street. the inside of the restaurant has about 5 small tables, 3 medium tables, and one long table (that's enough to fit 4 people). 
-you order at the cashier and pay right away. afterward, you go to pick up the food when they call your name. we waited around 10 minutes on line to order and then another 15 minutes for our food to be made. 
-the service here is great! the staff are super hardworking and they're open to giving recommendations/a run down of their relatively small menu.
-both cash and card payments are accepted.

9/5/21
-buddha rice: this bowl comes with white rice, black rice, quinoa, black beans, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, cherry tomatoes, tofu, vegan meat, mushrooms, corn, kale, pickled ginger, sunflower seeds, and roasted miso avocado. you can get the roasted miso avocado for an extra ~$5 on other dishes, but it comes free of charge for the buddha rice. i loved how balanced the meal was, and it was very filling as well. the roasted miso added an amazing flavor profile, and i enjoyed it a lot. my only complaint is that it started to taste too salty halfway through. this costed $12.79 including tax, which i thought was quite fair. it's not something that i would order again in the future, but i was really glad that i had decided to get this. (4/5)

overall, this place definitely deserves more hype, especially for their rice bowls! however, i'm not sure if i would come back in the future unless they added more options on their menu.
i would highly recommend that you must try their buddha rice with roasted miso avocado."
49,49,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,3/18/2022,"I ordered the curry masala ramen, it was so good. They made sure it wasn't as spicy which made it easier for me to eat. The broth was so rich in flavor. The noodles could have been softer but it was fine. I'm not vegan but I loved it! Would def recommend"
50,50,RED WHITE RAMEN,1 star rating,4/2/2022,"you can literally make your own instant noodles that taste better than this. the paper cups dont allow for the noodles to fully absorb the soup, way to overcrowded i felt like i needed to poke and dig up my noodles. there are def better options nearby"
51,51,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"Vegan ramen FTW! This place is really great. They have a modest menu with like six different types of ramen along with a rice bowl option. My wife had the miso ramen while I had the dragon's breath. Both were awesome.

Even better since my wife is gluten free, they are very well versed in allergy issues and they were able to sub rice noodles for the regular ones. The soup bases and topping are all gluten free too, so she could have a very close to ""normal"" experience. 

We didn't love the rice bowl and won't order that again, but we'll definitely be back soon when the craving hits again."
52,52,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,6/26/2021,"When Red White first opened I was not a fan. They definitely took a hard look at what they were doing, what was already out there, and what they could offer. And I'm blown away by what they came up with. 

Tried them for the first time the other day. I had the Mix Well (the no broth ramen) and my wife got the Sapporo Buddha. Everything about it was perfect. Simple but really tasty mix of textures and flavors. They even separate the ingredients from the broth for takeout so nothing gets soggy in transit. 

Just thank you so much to the RW team for adding this to the Boston vegan space. This immediately vaults into one of my favorite restaurants in the city."
53,53,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,6/22/2021,"Left P town in the cape early because of the weather. With it being rainy I decided to go to Boston to go on a little ramen spree (3 places in the day)

Met up with a friend who got there after us and told me that he was vegan so he wanted to show me this place. I've never been vegetarian or vegan and certainly never had vegan ramen so I was skeptical but boy was I wrong! 

I got the dragons breath (crushed it, broth and all) and my wife got the truffle ramen ans almost ate all of hers! (She never does that) 

Service was amazing the only thing I wish was that there was beer (maybe next time!)"
54,54,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,12/19/2020,"We stopped here for a quick bite prior to catching a train back to DC since it was close to our hotel. Despite my skepticism re: vegan ramen, I was pleasantly surprised. The broth was flavorful and the tofu + veggie combo (believe I got the Sapporo) was hearty enough for this meat loving girl. One of my dining partners was a vegetarian, so she was particularly impressed. The interior is cute but seating is pretty limited. Pricing wise, about on par with normal ramen ( $10-11) which can feel a tad expensive sans meat. That being said, certainly worth it for those who wouldn't otherwise get to enjoy a typical bowl of ramen. I think this place could do really well in D.C!"
55,55,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,6/15/2021,"Sweetest staff and delicious vegan ramen!!! Couldn't be happier! The miso ramen is my favorite, would honestly be happy eating this every day. Their menu is a little limited, but I've been happy with all their ramens!"
56,56,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,1/2/2022,So good! Huge portions! So tasty - worth the money. Definitely have a bunch of options for flavors and love the variety
57,57,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,11/30/2021,This is my favorite ramen spot in Boston hands down! My roommate and I get takeout at least once a week and always get the same thing: the King &. Queen (truffle flavor) and the Tokyo Masala (curry flavor) with chili oil and extra noodles on the side. I've also tried every other flavor on the menu and they're all amazing. Would give this place 10 stars if I could. I love you Red White
58,58,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,5/6/2021,"Has indoor (3 tables + counter seating) and outdoor seating (2 tables)! Lovely decor inside and great service. At the staff's recommendation, I got the new flavor of curry masala, which was creamy and slightly spicy from the chili oil. Could definitely taste the curry flavor, and the vegan toppings were super fresh! I admit to not being the biggest mushroom fan, but felt here that the umami they brought was very good. Definitely recommend coming here, especially if you want an affordable meal (~11 dollars!)."
59,59,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/30/2020,"All vegan ramen?! Sign me up! Yes this place is beyond worth traveling out of state for. Multiple times.
No place like this exists by us in RI especially not all vegan ramen.

The store is smaller due to being on Newbury but that doesnt stop the big bold flavors this place produces. Everytime we go in the staff is so friendly and BEYOND helpful.

They have about 6 or 7 vegans ramen to choose from. You can edit what you want in it because it's made from scratch. I always get tofu, corn and noodles.

PRO TIP: ALWAYSSSS ORDER EXTRA NOODS. IF YOU PAY FOR EXTRA GUAC AT PLACES, YOU SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM PAYING FOR EXTRA NOODS.

Their green tea is soooo good. You can tell its fresh because the tea leaves are still floating about. I love the authenticity. So with the ramen being a great price with the green tea is a perfect combo."
60,60,RED WHITE RAMEN,3 star rating,8/12/2021,"Not quite sure why this place received 4.5 stars. It's definitely not above average. The place looks more like a pick up and go kinda spot. V utilitarian. 

I ordered the King & Queen, which is a truffle salt flavor. The soup base lacked the usual umami, toppings were mediocre, and the ramen texture was a little too chewy. 

Should have realized when I saw the price point ($12 for a bowl of ramen). If we used Ipuddo as a comparison, RWBR is clearly a 3, tops."
61,61,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,7/28/2021,"My dad and I stopped in after attending a Red Sox game and we couldnt be more happy with our food. 

Neither of us had ever had a real vegan meal, and I was slightly terrified my dad would hate it. Man were we wrong. The food was absolutely delicious, the service was great, and I already cant wait to go back. 

If you like spicy, certainly try the spicy ramen. It had a kick, but also tons of flavor. HIGHLY recommended!"
62,62,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,11/20/2020,"This is an awesome place. The dish is absolutely phenomenal and delicious. The atmosphere and restaurant has so many nice decorations. 
We had a great time here, definitely recommend and will be back. 
Tok, the owner is very respectful, kind and sweet to his clients!!! 

FREE DELIVERY AROUND BACKBAY too!!!!"
63,63,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,10/22/2020,"As a non-vegan, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the Dragon Breath Ramen.  Definitely  cured my ramen fix- the broth was spicy enough to feel it but not enough to be overwhelmed.  I also have a very high spice tolerance, so I'd recommend avoiding this flavor unless you can handle spice.  The ingredients were very simple yet complemented each other very nicely.  Not earth-shattering level ramen, but very good considering.

The environment inside the restaurant is really cute and the workers there were very welcoming and accommodating.  Definitely will go again to try the Red Rice bowls they have- all in all a great experience!"
64,64,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,11/6/2021,"Just...can't...find...decent...food...in BOS.  I gotta be doing something wrong.

Blah...  King & Queen truffle salt broth was thin and boring (truffle?  This ain't no truffle).  No depth of flavor.  The artificial meat in the ramen disintegrated so it wasn't really satisfying.

This place is vegan.  I sure wish there was something highlighting that fact before I went there.  It appeared to me online as a standard ramen joint - not a vegan / vegetarian ramen place.  I respect vegans deeply but this particular food is just not that good.  It was not terrible but it was not good, either.

For the price charged I was expecting quite a bit more.

Oh, and the big no no:  don't prompt me for a tip when there is no service.  You order at the counter, pick up at the counter, and bus your own table.  There is NO service.  Tips are for service, they are not a handout, millennials.  No tip was paid.  No tip was deserved.  I will not be back and - this - put a cap on it."
65,65,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/11/2020,"I was walking on Newbury Street and was caught by the Dragon Breath Ramen sign outside of their restaurant. I love spicy food and ramen so thought I'd give it a try (lol did not realize it was vegan until I went in). The broth and noodles were very delicious and I did not feel bloated after eating it! The dragon breath ramen is prettyyyy spicy even with their regular spice level and I usually order extra spicy at other places, so just make sure to ask to lower the spice level if you think you can't handle it. 

The staff was friendly, welcoming, and put thoughts into making each bowl. They also have indoor/ outdoor seatings during COVID."
66,66,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,7/26/2021,"Omg! The food here is amazing!! 

I came across this place on Grubhub and decided to take a chance. It's safe to say that I will be ordering from here in the very near future!

Everything was well packed, flavorful and even still hot when it arrived. 

10 out of 10! Highly recommend!!"
67,67,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,4/30/2021,"My husband and I got 2 different ramens and they were both suuuuuper delicious!! I wasn't too sure about vegan ramen but OMG! So goood!
The staff were very nice and friendly :)"
68,68,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/20/2020,"I love Red White because its a great spot for broth-y vegan options. Their sauces are absolutely amazing and they have great toppings! I went for the Masterpiece which has vegan meat, and veggies which tastes like creamy sesame taste which totally translated. 

Can't wait to go back to try the other options especially with the weather cooling down and their amazing ramen bowl options :)"
69,69,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,11/8/2021,"Great little ramen shop.  Not a lot of choices, but makes it easier to decide.  Busy lunch business, but food comes out quickly.  Loved the Masterpiece special ramen."
70,70,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,3/16/2020,"I landed in Boston early for a weekend work trip and was working from the hotel in the morning, so I went out wandering to find a lunch spot. I came across Red White and was intrigued about the uniqueness of a fast-casual vegan Japanese bowl restaurant. 

I stopped in around 12:30ish and there were two Japanese guys manning the Chipotle-style counter of bases, toppings, etc. You can either get a soup bowl or a non-soup bowl with tofu, udon, or sushi rice. 

Food: 
- Humble Bowl (Monk Curry) - Broccoli, Tofu, Corn, Yam potatoes, Green peppers, Edamame, Kale, Arugula, Spinach, Monk curry sauce. I added the vegan spicy mayo on top as well. The bowl was so healthy, packed with very fresh veggies that were all seasoned well and prepared on their own. The scoop of monk curry was on top and had a lot of flavor. It was all very unique and only $10.95 for a whole bowl of fresh veggies! 

The cold green tea was super legit and strong, I would recommend getting it if you like cold tea. 

Overall, super cool concept to have fast-casual Vegan restaurant in a cuisine which normally has a lot of fish and pork based foods. Definitely would recommend if you are looking to try something new and healthy!"
71,71,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,10/23/2021,"Small menu, tasty but not inspired. No toppings on dishes, everything is just mixed in, so does not feel like the ramen you might get at a high end/authentic ramen shop. One rice dish is available, again everything mixed in so impossible to make special requests. The menu is very small. But 4 stars because it's tasty and vegan."
72,72,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,11/15/2021,Ordered the Dragons Breath and it was amazing! It has quite a kick & the broth is rich. I can't wait to come back!
73,73,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,3/31/2021,"Fantastic broth and chewy, thick noodles! Please know that when they say the Dragon's Breath is spicy, they really mean it. I would've enjoyed the mushroom and tofu to be in bigger pieces (and perhaps more of it?) and the spinach to be slightly blanched. Since the broth wasn't piping hot the spinach couldn't cook through properly. I got the miso flavor and it was very tasty."
74,74,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,11/7/2021,The Dragon's Breath had shredded cheese in it...why?!?! This was a very unpleasant surprise as I did not see this in the description or pictures. The broth was good and flavorful in theory but the cheese really ruined everything. I strongly recommend keeping cheese out of ramen
75,75,RED WHITE RAMEN,2 star rating,11/2/2021,Not kid friendly. Poor quality utensils. Decent flavors in ramen. Wouldn't recommend.

Super friendly environment and felt welcomed from the first step into the restaurant."

78,78,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/6/2021,Came to visit in with my husband and a friend. Everything was great!! It was more of an order and sit style with no server which usually isn't my preference but this was a great little ramen shop and we will be back.
79,79,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,10/14/2021,Still thinking about this ramen 2 weeks later. Broth was so good. I got the spicy dragon one and my bf got the truffled spiced one and both were amazing. Also the fact that everything on the menu is vegetarian makes it a good place for us so we have more options
80,80,RED WHITE RAMEN,5 star rating,2/8/2021,"My friend and I both got the dragons breath noodles. The packaging was ingenious (keeps the noodles from soaking in the broth for too long). For the diversity, my friend got ramen noodles & garlic chip add-ons and I got udon noodles & Japanese spicy powder. The garlic granules were excellent, however the powder did not do much to add to the spice. But the spice level was still respectable and cough-inducing. I was a fan of the udon and the portions were large. I think my friend also enjoyed hers since she needed to lie down on the floor for a while. This place has earned a vegan seal of approval!"
81,81,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,11/20/2021,Very good gluten free ramen. We chose the delivery option and went smoothly. It arrived on time. Still very hot

83,83,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,11/7/2021,"I've been meaning to try Red White for over a year since reading about it on all the lists of ""best vegetarian food in Boston."" I happened to be in the area today and decided to pop in for lunch. I got the Masterpiece (""Classic Sesame Flavor""). It came with corn, spinach, mushrooms, and tofu. While it's definitely one of the better ramens I've had since going vegetarian, it was far too salty for my taste. I polished off my 40 oz water bottle while I had the one bowl of ramen.

Customer service was excellent, and the interior was clean and nicely decorated. The food just wasn't to my taste."
84,84,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,2/29/2020,"This is a small basement dwelling that is brightly decorated with a nice, hand painted Asian feel. It's order at the kitchen fast food style but the food is much better. While there's no table service, the kitchen staff are super friendly, will greet you and guide you through the process if you're obviously a newly.

The ""process"" is navigating the main board of build-your-own bowls and broths. Lots of choices but the board guides you through it. I was initially disappointed as I went in for Ramen but then I notice a hand written sign for ramen stuck to the kitchen counter. I'm guessing it's not their forte but I ordered it anyway.

The bowl was really good, nice toppings and a flavourful broth. I think it was a miso base as it lacked the creamy goodness of my beloved tonkotsu style. But none the less, excellent, check out my photo.

I think I'll try a broth next time, ""stick with what they know"", but their ramen is pretty good too."
85,85,RED WHITE RAMEN,4 star rating,8/10/2021,The noodles is chewy and has texture. I love that. The soup is creamy and flavorful. I definitely recommend my veggie friends to visit here

Service 5/5
Our waiter was great. He was very knowledgeable, was walking around to constantly make sure we were ok, and overall provided great service.

Drinks 5/5
A few of us got drinks and each of us loved them. The table favorite was the honey do drink which was sooo delicious.

Food 5/5
My friends and I split a bunch of my things. The Mac and cheese is so good I get it everytime. The burger and chicken sliders have wonderful flavor. They're known for their chicken so you can't go wrong. The biscuits are so sweet and salty with delicious cheese and cinnamon butter dips. Everything is good. For dessert they had the greatest cappuccino ice cream, beignets, and bread pudding. The only thing we weren't completely sold on was the cast iron Brie. It was good, but I probably wouldn't get it again.

You can't go wrong @ B&B. If you're looking for a nice place to go in boston, it's always an option.

91,1,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/19/2022,"Took a solo trip to Boston and was so glad this spot made the list. I'm only sad that I didn't have a partner to split more dishes with me or a larger stomach!

I was able to walk in and grab a spot on a ledge near the bar as a single patron for dinner.

I was able to try the Honey glazed biscuits with the cheese spread (warm, delicious, both savory and sweet and pairs incredibly well with the pimento cheese) as well as the wings (sweet and spicy). The wings were phenomenal with the perfect crunch and coating to compliment the succulent wing meat. 

I wish I could remember the cocktail I ordered, but I remember it being quite delicious but also strong!

Service was good! Even though I was a single diner, I still felt very attended to. 

Ambiance was dark, sexy and intimate at dinner. The space had great energy and I really liked the feel and set up of the restaurant. 

Next time I'm up in Boston I'm definitely coming by to try some more items.

92,2,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/11/2022,"Lately I've taken another look at Buttermilk and Bourbon and I definitely believe they have come back to their original quality. Last few times I went the service has been impeccable and I've been loving the new menu options.

Would recommend as a cool cocktail lounge for friends or a delicious meal with family or significant other."
93,3,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,3/4/2022,"I think this place is a bit overrated despite its numerous reviews on Google. We booked a reservation on Open Table but the only available tables were outside. We arrived to find heat lamps present outside but not switched on and without any exterior lighting. Clearly there was no way we could feasibly sit outside in the dark in Boston cold weather, especially when heat lamps present weren't even turned out, but this is what was initially offered (??). We declined. Thankfully they were able to accommodate us inside. 

This place gets packed and pretty noisy. All the dishes are small and are tapas style.  We tried some raw oysters, the rainbow trout, biscuits, and wild boar chili. The rainbow trout and the biscuits stood out to me the most. To be frank, I couldn't tell the difference between wild boar meat and ground beef. The oysters didn't taste very fresh. If you plan to come, make sure you make a reservation but I didn't find my experience that remarkable."
94,4,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,2/12/2022,"Charming and vibrant with dim lighting. The ambiance has a touch of New Orlean's French Quarter charm.

ORDERED:
Grilled Octopus: it was delicious. Very tender and meaty. The combination of white bean purée, arugula, fennel, vinaigrette, and orange pieces was very well balanced and flavorful.

Honey Do Cocktail: it tasted like piña colada with a slice of grilled pineapple on top.

Overall, the octopus and the drinks were very good. Will definitely be back another time."
95,5,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,1/27/2022,"Buttermilk and bourbon is located in a basement about two blocks from Newbury street. I had a little trouble finding it but once I did, I was in for a delight! They were packed around 4:00pm on Saturday so I sat at the bar. I ordered the warm honey glazed biscuit, chicken wings with white bbq sauce, and 2 fried chicken sliders. 

Warm Honey Glazed Biscuit: this has to be the best biscuit I've had. The cinnamon butter paired with the biscuit was the perfect combination. The biscuit is warm, fluffy, and moist. I actually took it with me on a flight and ate it three days later, and it was still just as good. 

Chicken wings: I thought it was better without the bbq white sauce but still good nonetheless. I would say there wasn't anything super special about the chicken, but it's still good. 

2 fried chicken sliders: a must get. The chicken is tender and the brioche bun was perfect with it. 

Overall: I ordered a little too much for one person haha but everything was divine. I would come again on a weekday when it's a little less busy to experience the dining room. Definitely get the warm honey glazed biscuit."
96,6,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,2/27/2022,"If you are looking for southern hospitality in Boston, then you have come to the right place! Buttermilk & Bourbon services southern styled food, which reflects richness of flavor and history -- in the form of --fried crispy goodness. Almost every item on the menu was heavy/fried. My stomach was a bit sensitive, so I decided to order a couple ginger-ales and  I could not resist the decedent banana biscuit bread pudding. It was a shareable size and tasted divine! Our server was super friendly and accommodating to our large party."
97,7,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,12/8/2021,"Very good for the hype! I think I was putting off trying this place assuming it was hyped up, but the food is pretty good. We came for dinner on a Tuesday and it was busy so would recommend a reservation. 
For drinks, I had the A-wassalling which was a warm cocktail. Good flavor and satisfied my craving for a warm drink on a cold day. 
For food, we ordered the 1/2 fried chicken which was very crispy and moist on the inside. It wasn't the best fried chicken I've ever had, but definitely up there. I liked that the breading wasn't too heavy. The biscuits were SO good, so warm on the inside and caramelized with honey on the outside. Also had the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp which was also great. I love anything with grits! The Wild Boar Chili was also decent, but nothing too special."
98,8,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,1/9/2022,"Wanted to try out Buttermilk & Bourbon after seeing the high reviews. We were visiting Boston for a weekend trip and decided to try it out for dinner. It's tapas/small plates style and our waiter suggested 2-3 dishes for a party of 2. We went with the garlic herb Mac and cheese (comes with short rib), Nashville hot chicken wings, and 2 prime burger sliders. 

Out of the 3, the best dish was the Mac and cheese. It truly had a unique taste and the rib was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The wings and sliders were good but honestly nothing special. Ordering 3 dishes was definitely filling enough. It was the perfect amount without feeling stuffed. Our food came out quick and fresh from the kitchen which was a plus. We came right when they opened which may have helped since I know it's a popular place. Make sure to reserve a table ahead of time."
99,9,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/5/2022,"Had dinner here on a Wednesday night and it was packed! This has got to be one of the most delicious places I've eaten at in Boston. I came here with a friend and ordered 3 plates, and left overwhelmingly full. We ordered the fried chicken, warm honey glazed biscuits, and garlic mac and cheese. The service was very friendly, and the food came promptly. The biscuits were dense and sweet. The chicken was tender and flavorful, but not as special as the other dishes. The mac and cheese has to be my favorite! It was very unique in flavor and addicting to eat. I can't wait to try other kinds of food here next time, if I don't reorder the biscuits and mac and cheese again."
100,10,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"YUM!! Took me forever for me to get a weekend brunch reservation but so glad I did and well worth the wait and hype! Hip-cajun decor and southern/cajun inspired dishes. The soft serve mimosas are fun and tasty, definitely worth a try! The fried chicken and waffles were crispy on the outside, soft and steamy on the inside, and came with a side of watermelon which was unconventional but provided good balance to the meal.

The deviled eggs were piled high with tasty garnishes and were a good addition to the meal (although probably not the star).

The pulled pork benedict was really tasty--savory and sweet meat, the hollandaise was hollan-dank, and it was topped with a crispy fried egg instead of the traditional poached.

It's a must do for your Boston brunch bucket list!!"
101,11,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,2/25/2022,"This honestly might be my favorite restaurant in Boston- no joke. I feel like I don't even need to say anything else. Just come here and order everything on the menu lol. The Mac and cheese, fried chicken sandwich, alligator fries, Brussel sprouts, and THE BISCUITS were to die for. Cocktails were good too. Great service, loved the small shareable plates and very cool vibe inside. You have to try it."
102,12,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,2/11/2022,"Enjoyable cocktails, delicious octopus. 

Stopped by for drinks and a snack. Atmosphere was trendy and casual, with lots of little spaces to sit down for a drink.  Every menu seemingly needs to have octopus now, but hey, when it's good it's great and the one here was fantastic. Super meaty, super tender, great flavor that was well balanced by the various garnishes. I remember enjoying my drink, but I don't remember exactly what I ordered. The octopus took up too much mental bandwidth. 

I'd certainly come back to try more food."
103,13,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,4/4/2022,Came here while on vacation in boston. Oysters so fresh you can taste the sea. Everything on the menu is great as well as the cocktails (strong and beautiful). Will definitely come back again next time I'm in town.(4 stars bc no ac just fan and it was hot and humid)
104,14,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,4/10/2022,I got the sliders but I wish I had gotten the fried chicken (I tried it fortunately!) Great run based cocktails and the most delicious biscuit ever. Try it if you are in Boston!
105,15,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,4/8/2022,"With reservations booked out a whole month out, we decided to try walking in at 11:45 AM on a Saturday  morning. It was definitely already busy and no tables were available. But we were able to get a spot along the wall at the high tables and chairs for two, in between a few people. We were greeted within a few minutes by our waitress with some waters and menus. We ordered the WARM HONEY GLAZED BISCUITS with smoked cinnamon butter & pimento cheese spread. The biscuits were delicious with bits of salt on them. The spreads gave us a sweet and savory option. For the main course, we ordered the HOUSE SPECIAL - BUTTERMILK FRIED CHICKEN and waffles with Nashville hot, sweet & spicy, BBQ syrup as well as watermelon. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the waffles had peppers baked in. The watermelon was a nice refresher. We really wanted the FRESH FRIED BEIGNETS With Powdered sugar and chocolate, but we were too full. We will definitely be back for them. Highly recommend Buttermilk and Bourbon and make sure to reserve in advance."
106,16,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/27/2022,"First, I have to complement the staff. The host & waitstaff were extremely Friendly & helpful.  The food was phenomenal. The sauces for the cocktails were perfect. The cocktail sauce had the perfect blend of heat and smokeyness. The low country scramble looked small, but it was very filling. The grits were cooked to perfection & the sausage was excellent."
107,17,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,11/9/2021,"It was phenomenal. We loved it. 

stopped by with my wife and son. brie, mac n cheese, étouffée,  honey glaze salted biscuits. sliders. sprouts yea, lots of doggie bags

solid service and amazing food. made with love

bravo"
108,18,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,1/17/2022,"We ordered some drinks for brunch which were good! For food we got the honey biscuits, fried chicken and mac n' cheese. We liked all items ordered and were well satisfied. Three items was more than enough for us and the waitress said it was ""tapas style"" so we could order ser more. But we couldn't even make it through the three things we got."
109,19,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,1/10/2022,"(Last visited 4/28/2021.) Working in Boston for the week and a young lady at the hotel I'm staying at HIGHLY recommended this place so I had to check it out!

Atmosphere/Appearance: Set below street level on the corner of Commonwealth Avenue and Dartmouth Street is this beautiful gem. It was raining this evening so the outdoor seating section was pretty much closed off except for the few people that were sitting out there before the rain started. By the way, I HIGHLY recommend making reservations for this place because I couldn't get a seat until 9:30pm because I hadn't made reservations. Lol. Once in the front door it feels just a bit cramped, but once you make a left into the dining area or a right into the bar area the space certainly opens up. Now, I've never been to New Orleans, but I got a ""New Orleans"" feel from the restaurant. Lol. The dining room is decorated like an old mansion with lots of antiques in interesting wallpaper. The bar area is decorated similarly with a ominous purple glow. Very, very suave.

Service: Evan took care of me and he was awesome. He was quick, patient and made sure that I had everything that I needed.

Food: So Vallette (the young lady from the hotel) told me I had to try several things and since she's a native of the area, I trusted her. Here goes! I started off with a B & B Flight which comes with my choice of 3 bourbons from a select list. For an appetizer I went with a couple of their ""Lemon Shandy Peel & Eat Shrimp"". These shrimp were huge, of course still in their shells, but they peeled away quite nicely and are served with a cocktail sauce as well as like a... garlic-y, creamy, delicious sauce. Nicely done. After that I tried out their alligator fries! Just the fact that I'm able to try out alligator all the way in Boston is what sold me on these! The fries came out LOADED. The fries were crispy, well-seasoned then topped with breaded alligator nuggets, a few pickles, a creamy/spicy cajun sauce and chives. I told you it was loaded. Lol. These were delicious, but quite salty if I must say. Still very good how all of the flavors came together. The alligator itself was tender, crispy and had a very distinct taste that's hard to describe. The fries beneath all the madness helped cut all of the savory-ness of the other ingredients. For my entrée  I decided to go with special on the menu, the Cajun swordfish with asparagus. It was FANTASTIC. I loved every bite of it. There was a lil' bit of charring on the skin which gave the fish a lovely texture as you chewed. There was this, heavenly sauce made of angel tears that was served on the side that just went SO WELL with this dish. My goodness. As a bonus the kitchen sent out an order or authentic beignets. I had no more room for food, but because these delicacies are so soft, airy and fluffy, it made them so easy to stuff down! They were so soft, hot and deliciously sweet. I had never had a beignet before, but I'm a believer now!

Value:
B & B Flight = $16.00
Lemon Shandy Peel & Eat Shrimp = $4.50/each
Alligator Fries = $14.00
Swordfish = $15.00
Fresh Fried Beignets = $10.00 w/Chocolate = $11.00 /A La Mode = $12.00
This place isn't cheap, but it shouldn't be! The quality of the food was fantastic, the portions were good, the atmosphere was pleasant and everything was just grand. I can't wait to pay this place another visit!

110,20,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,1/4/2022,"I've been lamenting not having many good brunch places in Boston area until B&B.  It took a month ahead for the reservation but it was worth it!  Very welcoming and friendly service here. 

For 3 people, we ordered 7 dishes + coffee.  Every single dish was a big bang in flavors!  Prices were actually very reasonable for being in the Copley area with the big tapas portions.  
_Biscuit was moist and wonderful w/ the  cinnamon whipped butter
_Alligator fries were juicy and perfect - soooo good!
_Beans and arugula salad was refreshing
_Banana French Toast was rich and creamy- gone in 10 mins. LOL
_Fried Chicken and waffle were moist, perfectly fried, watermelon side was a good touch.
_Duck Confit w/ sunny side up eggs was pretty and tasty, but the toast underneath was burnt, this can be improved. 
_Jalepenos hush puppies were delicious - this place gets it right!

We love the funky voodoo ambiance!  Definitely a fun place to brunch w/ family and friends.  Highly recommend!

My brother love the spicy alligator sauce so much that he rub the slab of left over fried chicken in the iron pan."
111,21,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,3/17/2022,"We came here as a pre-game spot before heading to the house of blues for a concert. The hostesses weren't very friendly AT ALL but I'll focus on the food for the purpose of this review, which was amazing! And our waiter was great as well. He came over and gave us the lay of the land, how the food is basically tapas style so be prepared to order a few and share. The food came out hot and freshly prepared. We sat in the lounge area which was very intimate and maybe not so good, made me feel comfortable enough to take a nap after I ate Haaha, though I didn't. I think my favorite was definitely the Alligator Fries. Ooooh and those biscuits!!!! Just enough softness, a tad bit of crunch and that sweet butter to top it off! The drinks had such a pleasing taste and were pretty to look at too. You can make a reservation and it's probably recommended on most days. We went when they first opened on a Wednesday so we were able to be seated. Will definitely return on another Boston visit"
112,22,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,9/25/2021,"Tried Buttermilk & Bourbon for an early dinner. This place is very difficult to reserve for weekend brunch. We were told we need to reserve weeks in advance for brunch. Overall the food was good, depending on the dish. However, a bit overpriced for what you're getting.  Tapas-sized to medium sized portions. Probably to be expected for a place around Newbury Street. Pretty busy - if you're planning to visit, definitely make sure you have a reservation to save yourself some hassle. 

Food:
- Warm honey glazed biscuits: definitely recommend. Very flavorful and substantial. A step above the biscuits you would get at fast food breakfast places. You get 4, though I wish we had more spread. 
- 2 fried chicken sliders: definitely recommend. Medium-sized sandwiches, not teeny tiny sliders. Chicken was crunchy on the outside and not dry on the inside. Interesting combo of flavors in one bite. 
- Nashville hot alligator fries: skip. We tried for the novelty of the dish. The meat was dry. The fries were good. 
- pulled pork croquettes: definitely skip. Not memorable (sorry)

Atmosphere: Ample outdoor seating with umbrellas. The indoor seating has better atmosphere, but we preferred to dine outside during COVID. 

Service: Timely and professional. No complaints."
113,23,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,9/15/2021,"I see this place for brunch recommendations so it has been on my list for a very long time. There were no reservations for brunch on Saturday so my friend and I decided to walk in right when they opened. We were seated indoors promptly. It seems that they don't do brunch on Saturdays, only on Sundays. They did have a chicken and waffles special, but we were kind of disappointed that we didn't get to try the brunch. 

They don't do any modifications or single biscuits, so we had to order the full biscuit appetizer which came with 4-5 hot biscuits. I'm not complaining, those biscuits were the star of the meal! Hot, buttery with a cheese spread. For our mains we got the chicken and waffle special. It came with friend chicken and what seemed like cornbread shaped like a waffle. It also had watermelon and butter. The spicy glaze whose name I recall, I wish they had given us more of that, or drenched our fried chicken in it. 

Overall, even though there were no reservations, the place was not busy at all, lots of space available indoors and outdoors. Taking a star off because the food was mediocre, but the biscuits were fire!"
114,24,Buttermilk & Bourbon,2 star rating,10/14/2021,"We didn't have a reservation for lunch on a Thursday and were promptly seated if we could be done in one hour as they had reservations. No problem...

The lunch menu (compared to the brunch one we had tried before), was disappointing. We ordered the mushroom toast and the fried catfish. The catfish was great but the mushroom toast was too salty. The fish entree came first and I had to wait for 7-10 minutes for my mushroom toast to be ready!!!

When your server looks like he really doesn't want to be there, lacks energy and enthusiasm, it really doesn't make it pleasant!!!

I hoped for a lot better experience but they fell really short."
115,25,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,8/14/2021,"Dining at Buttermilk & Bourbon was probably one of my highlights visiting Boston! The food here is AMAZING! We were lucky enough to come without a reservation and be seated, but def make a reservation. It was packed on a Monday evening.

I highly recommend the biscuits! Those babies are so delicious. It comes with a side of cinnamon butter and pimento cheese. Pass on the pimento cheese lol. Our hot fried chicken was also really good. The chicken was actually hot and had a kick to it! My boyfriend also enjoyed his mushroom toast as well. 

The mac and cheese was a disappointment for us. It literally tasted like Kraft from the box. The mac and cheese wasn't baked long enough and had a weird consistency.

Other than that, everything else was great! Highly recommend if you're in Boston!"
116,26,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,2/21/2022,"Came here for dinner last week and was amazed! Everything was so delicious! I love how it's basically tapas, small plates. We are able to try so much more. Prices were reasonable. I particularly loved the biscuits. We also really enjoyed the prawn handpiepies, BBQ octopus, and shrimp cocktail."
117,27,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,12/23/2021,"I've heard so much hype surrounding Buttermilk & Bourbon - I knew I had to give it a try! I made a reservation for a Thursday evening at 5:30 for 2 people. When we arrived, I was surprised by how many open tables there were given the fact that reservations are so difficult to get. 

We ordered the Nashville alligator fries, warm honey glazed biscuits, and boneless fried thighs with sweet & spicy sauce since these seemed to be the most popular dishes. The alligator fries were definitely a novelty - I can now officially say that I've had alligator! The pieces of alligator basically tasted like fried chicken. If you want to say you've had alligator, then this dish is worth trying - or else, you wouldn't miss much by skipping this dish. The biscuits had a sweet honey crust on top and a dense inside. I wish the honey flavor covered more of the biscuit, since it was a little bland otherwise. I did like it with the cinnamon butter, and less so with the cheese spread. The chicken thighs were very moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. I wish I had asked for the sweet & spicy sauce on the side because I thought it was a bit too sour for my liking. Maybe one of the other sauces would have been a better match for me. 

Overall, we had a good experience. I feel like my expectations were sky-high due to all of the hype I've heard surrounding this place. As a result, the food didn't seem to meet my expectations and I was a tiny bit disappointed that I didn't like everything more. I think next time I'd want to try the chicken sliders and the beignets. Regardless, I still very much recommend Buttermilk & Bourbon if you want great Southern food!"
118,28,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"It took me a long time to actually get reservations here -- and the wait was worth it. Even packed on a Wednesday night, the space makes you almost feel like you're in a whole in the wall in NOLA instead of on comm Ave itself. The drinks were wonderful and the food was even better. The wild boar chili with cornbread dumplings will have me coming back again and again."
119,29,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,2/16/2022,"What a find! 

Loved this spot from top to bottom of my drink! Came across it online while travling in Boston and the name alone is what drew me in, but the ambiance, the bar area, the drink & brunch options, all were amazing! 

Sat by the bar with my buddy to grab brunch & drinks. I had gone with the bloody mary & swapped vodka for bourbon, which came out perfect! Did the same on the second drink, but they have a bloody mary option that comes with a jumbo shrimp as well, so I ordered that and even better! 

Shared the hushpuppies which was a perfect choice, loved that they had it on the menu, and they didn't have the benedict so I went with the duck confit on toast and again, just a delighful dish that I would gladly have again if I'm up in the area!"
120,30,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,8/8/2021,"We decided to go here for the Sunday brunch.  All of the reviews I read raved about the biscuits. The girls have been here recently and enjoyed it.

When we called they said they didn't have any empty tables, even though we were getting there just as they opened. They did say over the phone that we could sit at the bar .

When we arrived they were able to sit us outside which was perfect due to the weather being awesome.

We ordered right away and the staff was prompt to take our order. We started out with coffee and an order of biscuits (4). The reviews are right the biscuits are to die for. Crispy top and buttery flaky inside. 

Our daughter had ordered the mushroom hash, which was wild mushrooms sauteed with peppers and potatoes. With a side of thick cut bacon. This came out first not long after we ordered. This was good, the wild mushrooms were cooked and really mimicked  the meat that would normally be in a hash. This dish is a tad spicy.

Our other daughter ordered the french toast with a side of over med eggs. The french toast was incredible and came out about 10 minutes after the hash dish, but without the eggs.

We then sat for about 30 minutes watching many dishes come out and be delivered to tables around us. We finally inquired about our two plates of biscuits and sausage gravy with one side of grits. By this time my daughter had finished her hash and my wife and I had finished our coffee and mimosa's.

The manager said he would look into the delay and shortly my daughter's eggs were delivered even though her french toast was about consumed. Did want to eat them together but that didn't work out. The egg whites were a tad runny for her liking.

Our sausage gravy and biscuits finally came out 45 minutes after we ordered. The grits another 10 minutes after that. Not sure what happened but it seemed like our order was lost.

I will say I gave the 3 stars because the food was outstanding. The biscuits were just as the previous reviews had mentioned. I could have sat and just ate a bucket of them. The hash, french toast and plates of biscuits and gravy were scrumptious. The grits are jalapeno grits, very creamy and spicy. All and all I would come back for the food.

It's pricey and not sure what had happened to our order, but the waitress apologized for the delay, just wish the manager had come by to apologize as well.

It was a Sunday, so the onstreet parking was free if you were able to find a spot. The outside patio also was very nice."
121,31,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,6/30/2021,"I've been wanting to come here ever since moving from the Deep South to see what sort of southern food theyd be bringing up here. Came for a Sunday brunch and the food did not disappoint! 

I'd recommend definitely getting some biscuits for the table with honey butter and pimento cheese. Everything else we got was a great hit: grits and sausage, pork hash, and pulled pork Benedict. The blackened bloody Mary's and other cocktails were delicious and spicy. The slushee-style mimosa (?) looked interesting and would give it a go next time I come.

Apart from the food, however, the delivery and service was really inconsistent. I'd probably chalk it up to staffing issues since reopening, but it was pretty bad for us. I received my eggs about 15 minutes before the other dishes, so they were naturally cold when we all started eating. Biscuits came last, although I shouldn't complain too much since they were hot. In fairness, the server did tell us food would be delivered when ready, but timeliness (or lack thereof) did make the experience awkward and left a little to be desired."
122,32,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,7/4/2021,"I knew the food would be good, but I guess I was pleasantly surprised by the service with how many recent negative reviews I've seen regarding the service. Either that or I'm too used to hands off Chinatown waiters. Anyway, service wise, we were seated promptly since we had a reservation. Water and drinks were timely. No issues given that this place is super popular and they were busy. 

My friends got the Voodoo and a Bloody Mary. The frozen Voodoo (rose vodka, elderberry, strawberry, and lemon) was pretty good and a good amount of alcohol. The Bloody Mary seemed pretty heavy on the old bay. 

For the food, the got the warm honey glazed biscuits, the Nashville hot alligator fries, the chicken and waffles special, pulled pork Benedict and the low country scramble. The biscuits are a must. Like get it you have to. Super fluffy, sweet and salty. There isn't a more perfect carb out there. The alligator fries were good. Alligator has a pretty good kick to it. The pulled pork Benedict had really tender pulled pork the eggs kind of remind me of scotch eggs, except the middle is runny. The low country scramble was pretty good, the jalapeño grits were definitely a fav. 

Overall pretty decent brunch place to get together with friends now that we can all be out and about again. Food is good and portion sizes are pretty big. Plan accordingly!"
123,33,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,2/5/2022,"During the pandemic, it was so hard to find a place that still had brunch open for dine in seating and I'm so glad I discovered this place. 
One of the unique things about this place is that if you follow their IG, you'll notice the menu items change from time to time and I think that's pretty fun to follow. There's always going to be something new and interesting to try on the menu."
124,34,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,2/20/2022,Love. The. Biscuits. This place has the absolute best biscuits and just on that alone is why I would go out of my way to come here. I came with a couple of coworkers after work and we enjoyed ourselves. This place is definitely a place to dress casual and it's noisy.
125,35,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,11/12/2021,"This was a fun place, with good food and friendly service. 

Food: hushpuppies were excellent. Boar chili was good, and while the cornbread dumplings were great, the chili could be a lot more flavorful. Bread pudding made for a fun dessert, although it was a little dense (then again, it ~is~ bread pudding). 

Cocktails: Had the A-wassaling, which is gin, apple cider, lemon, and honey. Pretty good, but not that notable."
126,36,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,11/29/2021,I've been to this place twice and is now moving forward my restaurant of choice in Boston! Every plate that we ordered was delicious! My fav was the beignets. Def plan to come back!
127,37,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,5/3/2021,"A must go to for Sunday brunch! This restaurant is located in a great spot in Back Bay with such amazing New Orleans inspired food and ambiance. Their menu is so unique and unlike anywhere else in Boston, you cannot go wrong with what you order. 

I made a reservation for when my friend came to visit. You definitely need to make a reservation early on for weekend brunch, they fill up fast! I made the reservation before knowing the weather. At the time it was nice in Boston, so I made a reservation for outside. But of course on the day of it was quite cold out. They had a bunch of heaters outside so it wasn't bad at all. 

Since they're so busy on the weekends, the service was a little slow. But our waitress was so nice and kept apologizing. My friend and I didn't have anywhere to be so it was nice to hang out and chat for a while. 

The food was incredible! The Nashville alligator fries are a definite must! Never had alligator before but it was delicious! They have two options for biscuits, so of course we got both. But if you only want to order one, go for the honey biscuits! I'd love to go back for dinner and try more of their food!"
128,38,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,4/29/2021,"Finally got to try the famous B&B and it lived up to the hype. 

Warm Honey Glazed Biscuits ($14): these glorious biscuits are a must have here! I thought it would be too sweet for my taste based on the description but it wasnt that sweet at all! It has such a unique texture where its fluffy and slightly gritty like cornbread at the same time? It comes with smoked cinnamon butter and pimento cheese spread that has a bit of spice. I personally preferred the cinnamon butter that reminded me of the one at texas roadhouse (very different texture! less sweet and less cinnamonny)

Sweet and Spicy Chicken Wings ($12): the batter is perfectly crispy and the meat is super moist and juicy. It is not that spicy nor too sweet. Has LOTS of garlic flavor! 

Nashville Hot Alligator Fries ($14): surprisingly my favorite dish here! The fries were fried to perfection and the cajun spices added a nice kick. The queso and the comeback sauce added a nice cheesy and creamy component. The ALLIGATOR THOUGH was my favorite part. It really is alligator and it tasted like a mix of chicken and pork. It was super crispy and juicy. I devoured it!! 

Cant wait to go back and try some of their other dishes!!"
129,39,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"For drinks I got the hurricane and the frozen voodoo, and I really loved both. They were both fruity and refreshing, with just the right amount of sweetness. For entree I got the buttermilk fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce and the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was my absolute favorite. The short rib was very well cooked and the cheese was just lovely."
130,40,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/12/2022,"The food and drinks were amazing. My boyfriend is from the south and he is extremely critical of the southern food we make up north but he was blown away by the food, the biscuits especially. I think it made him happy to find a slice of home up here in Boston. It was a little loud, but the atmosphere was also great."
131,41,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,10/18/2021,"Definitely make sure to make reservations if you want to eat in this popular brunch spot! Plating for all the dishes was very nice, and there are lots of delicious options, so you can't go wrong! Of course, I had to try the chicken and waffles. The chicken was crunchy, and I was happy that it was boneless chicken (although bone-in chicken probably would have been more juicy). Not the best fried chicken I've ever had, but it was decent. Waffles were a little on the soggy side. Something unique here was the honey butter and the sweet and spicy sauce. I personally wasn't a fan of of the spicy sauce (would have preferred regular maple syrup), so I just used the delicious butter as the topping for the chicken and waffles. Overall, the meal satisfied my brunch cravings."
132,42,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,11/19/2021,"This was the perfect dinner for us after a long day of traveling to the East Coast. The restaurant has a very relaxed atmosphere, and the building is absolutely beautiful. We enjoyed some of their fried buttermilk chicken with sweet and spicy sauce, as well as their oysters and their mac & cheese."
133,43,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,6/26/2021,"Buttermilk and Bourbon had been on my list for forever, and I'm glad we finally got to go!

Needless to say, the Honey Biscuits are a MUST HAVE if you come here. My gosh, they are so good. I don't know if I've ever had a biscuit that's so good! You get 4 of them and they are a good size!

And the swordfish dish is amazing. I'm glad I saw other reviews that recommended it! The crab salad on the bottom is like a crab cake (and it's amazing!)

And wow, the wings are great too! Nice and crispy and the sweet and sour sauce is so delicious. Can't wait to try their other flavors. 

And the drinks were excellent and creative!

The beignets were decent. They could be a bit sweeter for my tastes, but their quality was nice and fresh. We got it a la mode and the ice cream was more like a froyo-style. I'm not a big froyo person so would have personally preferred regular ice cream. 

Definitely want to go back here soon and try more of their dishes!"
134,44,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,11/17/2021,"I had such high hopes for Buttermilk & Bourbon but it just didn't live up to the hype.  I stopped in for lunch--it was a little hard to find, given the construction, but I spotted a sign and stepped inside.  They didn't have any standard table seating, so I was brought to ""lounge"" style seating, which was couches and chairs--comfortable enough, but kind of a weird vibe since the tables were coffee-table height and not ultra suited to a meal.  I went with the sliders (nice, but a little greasy) and a side of non-alligator fries, which were somehow bland and unenjoyable.  Service was good, so maybe it was an off-day -- but I wouldn't make another special trip just to try it, given that the $14 sliders weren't enough for a meal without a side of $6 fries."
135,45,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"I've been here several times as am Jason Santos devotee and also cheering on Chef Julian's career. Recent favorites include the biscuits, hush puppies, roasted oysters (!!!! Get you some) and mac and cheese. My friends like the cocktail menu and I preferred a glass of albariño with my meal. 
Let me say a word about the staff. They are nice and helpful, prompt and efficient. I recently left my phone in the washroom and had to come back for it. They were busy trying to figure out how to message me about it when I showed back up. Quite a load off my mind and no mistake to get it back. Many thumbs up to the great staff at Buttermilk and Bourbon!!"

The food is small plates so if you are coming there too really EAT , then you need to buy a few things off the menu. 

The alligator fries is a must, SOOOOOOOO good! 
Sliders ehh nothing special 
Short rib plate - delicious!
I couldn't remember what fish meal I got it might have been a special- but it was very tasty
Kudos to the chef team for these unique plates!

Will be back for sure!"
138,48,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,11/6/2021,"This place is sooo good for brunch and dinner. It's New Orleans/Cajun themed with voodoo vibes - so fun! The drinks are really really good and the food is amazing to match.

If you come here and don't get the biscuits you're doing it wrong. They're warm and glazed with honey - I have dreams about them daily.

Also, the gator fries with real alligator are sooo good. The fried chicken is done right here too. Can't wait to go back!"
139,49,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,1/12/2022,"Perhaps this place was a bit overhyped or maybe I went in with too many expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised!

It is tapas style and the portions are small, so I'd suggest ordering 4 things to be filling!

I went with a friend and ordered 4 things with a bit of leftovers to take home. 

Warm Honey Glazed Biscuits - this is their staple and a must! I could eat these all day if I could! The butter that comes with it is to die for, but you definitely get full after eating 2. 

Shrimp and Grits - interesting flavor profile, wasn't bad at all but I wouldn't get it again over the other options.

Nashville Hot Alligator Fries - standards fries with a little bit of a kick. I think it's worth getting once but not a staple order. 

House special Buttermilk Fried Chicken w / Sweet & Spicy Sauce - classic and must order if you're going to go there. Im not a huge lover of fried stuff but this was not too oily and portions were more than enough for me and my friend."
140,50,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,2/16/2022,Maybe I didn't order the right thing considering I'm vegetarian. I ordered the peanut hummus and the Brussels sprouts and I didn't feel too good after eating them. The peanut hummus tasted too bland and the Brussels sprouts were overly flavorful. Maybe a bad combo? I could still taste the Brussels sprouts the next day after brushing.
141,51,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,2/16/2022,"Southern comfort food done right!! Everything I ate here was insanely delicious, but definitely not super healthy. Great comfort tapas to share with a friend or on a date. The catfish and Mac and cheese are so good."
142,52,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,4/26/2021,"This is a great spot located slightly off of newbury street! The fried chicken (Nashville spicy) was really crispy and actually very tolerable in terms of spice. It was an enjoyable spicy level, not one where i felt like I was dying. 

The Cocktails are delicious, I can barely taste the alcohol. The sweet potatoes and Mac and cheese were amazing as well. I'd recommend 1-2 dishes per each person in your party and sharing is encouraged. 

Good food, good experience. Can't ask for much more."
143,53,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,9/1/2021,"I was surprised to see this place on Yelp and other sites as a highly recommended restaurant/bar (who would think a southern style place would be good in Boston?). I finally checked it out and loved it! 

It's located on a beautiful street, in a pretty historic building. Plenty of outdoor seating, nice decor indoors, the staff is great. 

I had the boneless fried chicken thighs with Nashville hot (it had a good kick so be careful if you don't like spice) and the crawfish hand pies. The portions were good (enough for two people), and they were both flavorful. 

They also have unique cocktails, but they can make you anything you want. The first drink I had was sweet, but I had the bartender make me a Negroni which was perfect."
144,54,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,8/22/2021,I would give 3.5-4 stars. It was my first time trying alligator fries and it literally does taste like fried chicken. I enjoyed alligator. The beignets were cooked so fresh and powdered just right. The restaurant is downstairs and it's a cool atmosphere.
145,55,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/12/2021,"Make a reservation!! This restaurant is always packed, and reservations for the weekend dinner/brunch are always booked!! 

This place was amazing. From the decor, the service, the food...it was all incredible. I'm very analytical, and I literally don't have ONE bad thing to say! They are also opening a 2nd location in Watertown down the street from me and I can't wait!"
146,56,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,2/8/2022,"Love this place! Very cool vibes inside, good food and drinks. Tapas style, lots of southern themed food."
147,57,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,8/1/2021,Love love the food here. Fried alligators with fries and pickles were AMAZING! Heavily seasoned with comeback sauce. The burger sliders didn't disappoint either. Perfect summer weather to have some soft serve mimosas. The outdoor sitting view was very pretty and romantic. It was a great brunch experience there.
148,58,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,4/4/2021,"I've been here several times at lunch, dinner, late at night, holidays. The waitstaff have always been professional and very efficient with scheduling. They have a edgier artistic ambiance than the typical glitzy airy Back Bay, so would be a good spot for dates. Usually very busy.

I like their cocktails most, and really enjoy trying new items on their menu - 3 months after ordering and loving their buttery crab dip, it's been replaced with something new on the menu. I hope it comes back soon! Split their beignets with a friend, they're worth it."
149,59,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,9/26/2021,"First time here. We finally decided to try Buttermilk & Bourbon's brunch. The overall experience was nice. We ordered jalapeño grits, andouille sausage, eggs, biscuits and beef sliders. Overall the food probably would have tasted great had it all been served hot instead of lukewarm. The grits were just cold cold, so we sent it back. Another concern was everything came out one dish at a time. The sausage came out first...a long wait...then out comes grits...another wait...biscuits were served...wait wait wait...oh here are the eggs. Get the idea? And with the exception of the sliders which were a nice temperature and served last, we weren't able to eat food together like a meal. Nonetheless, it wasn't a bad experience and the food had good flavor. Maybe we'll try again for lunch or dinner."
150,60,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,7/26/2021,"found myself here with a group on a saturday late afternoon. we went in with no reservation and were told to either come back at 10p for a table or sit at the bar, so we chose the bar

staff was quick and ordering was efficient. i started out with dessert first because i didn't want a large meal. chose the beignets because i had heard they were pretty good here. i think they were hyped up too much because i didn't think they were anything special and tasted reminiscent of the fried dough with powdered sugar you can get at town fairs. after finishing those, i found myself still hungry so went for the new orleans bbq shrimp. this dish was amazing and made up for the lackluster beignets. i've never had grits before and the texture took a while to get used to but the sauce that this dish has is perfect with the grits. i also wish there were more shrimp instead of just 4. i quickly ate all the shrimp and was left with a bunch of grits at the end. still a great dish though! 

good place, nice ambiance, good vibe and friendly staff. would come back"
151,61,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,7/6/2021,"I had high hopes for Buttermilk & Bourbon, and while I enjoyed my meal I don't think I'd return. We went on a warm Sunday around noon and were able to make a 2pm reservation. The hostess was very helpful. When we came back at 2, we had a table on the sidewalk patio. 

The outdoor space is very nice, it's a pretty quiet street without too much traffic. We ordered the Big Freedia and Frozen Voodoo drink, both were very good and refreshing! Very fun brunch drinks. 

For food, we got the warm honey glazed biscuits and chicken and waffles to share. The fried chicken was amazing, hot and fresh and flavorful. The carbs were a little disappointing though. The biscuits were HUGE, but only the glazed outside parts had much flavor. The cheese and butter spread helped but I felt like the biscuits were lacking some natural flavor. The waffles were a little soft and soggy, they tasted good but didn't have the right crispy texture I want from waffles. I did really like the watermelon on the side. 

The kitchen seemed really backed up and our food came out in a weird order. We got a side of scrambled eggs first, a long wait, then our two drinks, another wait, and then the rest of the food. We also ordered a side of bacon that never came. Our server was very nice and took it off our tab. 

Overall, a nice Sunday brunch with really good drinks! I probably wouldn't come back for just the food though."
152,62,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,9/6/2021,"One of the only restaurants in Boston I know that serves good southern food. We ordered a multitude of items, including the BBQ Shrimp, Boneless Thighs Nashville hot, Nashville Hot Alligator fries, Slow Roasted Baby Back Ribs, and the bread pudding for dessert. Everything was delicious, and the Nashville hot alligator and chicken had a great kick. Our entrees for 4 totaled about $100, which is a great value considering the quality and variety. Our waitress was also very kind and attentive.

My only complaint is we ordered a lemonade and iced tea. The lemonade was very bitter and the iced tea was watery. I would caution against non alcoholic drinks and request ""light ice"" for any drinks. Otherwise, great experience!"
153,63,Buttermilk & Bourbon,2 star rating,7/1/2021,"While the food here might be okay the service was snooty and parking was atrocious. I got the burnt waffles, dry fried chicken and old watermelon. They get two stars because the beignets and churro ice cream were awesome. I won't be back in a hurry. If I do, I hope to update this review."
154,64,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,8/24/2021,"Came here with reservations on a Monday afternoon. We were seated on time by the friendly hostess. It was a comfortable ambience with simply decorated plants located about. 

We ordered family style including the simple roasted mushroom toast, Nashville hot alligator fries, chicken wings in sweet & spicy sauce, crawfish etoufee hand pies, New Orleans BBQ shrimp, and baby kale salad for some additional greens. I liked the variety of mushrooms used for the toast as well it being a hearty slice. We had the alligator served on the side of the fries due to a food preference in which everyone enjoyed by itself. The alligator reminded me of perfectly fried popcorn chicken. We were surprised the wings were coated in the sauce as opposed to served on the side as it did cause the skin to be on the soggy side. The flavors themself were not as complementary as other sweet & spicy sauces I've had. I liked the crawfish pies as the dough held their shape well but would have preferred a spicy Mayo or more creamy sauce as opposed to the regular Mayo and red hot served. When eating the shrimp and grits, I found it to be incredibly salty and heavy. Definitely would pass on in the future. They ran out of ricotta for the kale salad but I'm not sure how much of a difference it would have made as I found it to fall flat of being a well balanced in taste and texture. 

Our dessert was the fresh fried beignets with chocolate. The name is accurate as they were hot from the fryer but lacked the satisfying chewy dough aspect as it was very airy. It would have better matched the heavy chocolate sauce on the side as well.

Overall, decent experience with a friendly waitress. Would want to come again knowing which dishes I enjoyed and to try some of their drinks."
155,65,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,8/22/2021,Not bad. But also not New Orleans. Not that they said it would be. The hand pies were mostly celery and did were quite reminiscent of etouffe as I'd hoped. The dri KS were great . The NO bbq shrimp was aiight but I thought it was a little heavy on the BBQ. It completely overpowered the grits. The chicken sliders were awesome. I wished I had gotten the chicken dish. Service was good. It's small plates and tapas so keep that in mind.
156,66,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,3/15/2022,"Absolutely ammaazzzzimg food and service (Fernando was our sever)! I mean, just phenomenal!"
157,67,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,7/3/2021,"Great spot in Back Bay, consistently great food, drinks and service. Fried chicken crispy and not greasy. Baked goods sweet. Drinks hurricane, soft serve Prosecco, very next level. Outdoor vibe great o a nice day. Right side back room is a bit dark and stuffy. Service always top notch. Has something for every taste bud. Definitely one of our regular family spots."
158,68,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,12/22/2020,"I came here for brunch during the random 60 degree December Sunday this year. We had an outside table with a time limit of 90 minutes. Unfortunately, everyone and their mother was in Back Bay that day (pandemic be damned) and it took forever to find parking. By the time I was able to get to the table, we only had a small amount of time left, so my friend placed a share order for us while I circled around in my car.

We had a couple of bloody marys that were quite good and came with a large shrimp to munch on. My next drink was the Whodi Smash (bourbon, lemon, blackberry, mint) which was fairly light, but tasty. A good brunch drink.

For food, we shared the beignets (almost like they came out of New Orleans!) and the fried chicken and waffles. The portions were quite large and perfect for sharing. We got 3 large pieces of chicken and a normal sized cheddar waffle. There were a couple of sauces (sweet and spicy syrup and honey butter) and a side of watermelon. I do wish there was a ""normal"" syrup, but I didn't ask, so maybe that could have been added or substituted. The food was quite good and I wish I had a chance to taste more dishes. I'll try to come back soon!"
159,69,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,4/4/2022,Very delicious tapas-style dishes! The fried chicken was the best I've ever had. We also loved the New Orleans style shrimp. The cocktails were also sooo delicious. 10/10 would come back
160,70,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,3/6/2022,"I went and they had no fried foods, so my review is a bit lacking; however, *almost* everything I had was flavorful and delicious. FYI: this is a small plates restaurant 

The octopus, short rib mac and cheese, and glazed biscuits were cooked perfectly and my favorite part of the meal. The octopus was so tinder and I really enjoyed the smokey flavor. Classic biscuit and cinnamon butter combo, hits every time. The pimento butter wasn't my favorite, but it might be yours. 

I wouldn't recommend their oysters, raw or cooked, definitely can find better elsewhere. Service was nice, drinks were pretty good and a little strong, which is a plus for me. Have to update when I can try the fried foods. Give it a try for a fun dinner with friends, great place for sharing food and having nice conversations."
161,71,Buttermilk & Bourbon,2 star rating,5/28/2021,"If this was suppose to be one of Boston's best restaurants, I can the hear the  crowd of food critics chanting,  ""o-v-e-r-r-a-t-e-d!!"" First of all, I want to give the customer service a half-star because they came to work today. Other than that,  I was unimpressed with the care and attention they gave their customers. I rode a blue bike from South Station to BackBay because I was expecting this restaurant to blow me away with an excellent service and food. The pictures on their website made the food look tantalizing and raised my expectations. But from my first impression with customer service,  to my last impression with tasting the food, I was extremely disappointed. It felt like I was in an episode of ""Restaurant Catfish,"" if that's a real show. 

Here's a summary of my experience:

I was told that there was no more seating because they  ""overbooked"" - even  though there were numerous empty seats without a wave of customers flooding into the restaurant. So, I decide to order take out because I had to try the food that was well advertised. I was especially interested in the ""signature chicken"" and the ""shrimp with grits"". I ordered those items and patiently waited for thirty minutes hoping that the delicious food will cleanse mental palette from the  bad customer service experience. When I received my food, I started with eating the ""shrimp and grit."" As the combination of flavors hit my palette, my high expectation came crashing down from a potential five stars restaurant to a one star. I couldn't believe it - so I tried a second bit hoping my palette was lying on me. Sad to say, this was truthful reality - the food was salty and flavors were well below average. The best part of this dish was the texture of the grits - it was cooked well. The flavor combination was not good. 

Now, I definitely had a negative perception of this restaurant because good restaurants are suppose to serve tasty food, no matter what you order from the menu. Since the food was bad, my assumption was the signature chicken was definitely be  ""over hyped"" by the pictures. I tried to clear my mind of these negative assumptions as I sunk my teeth into the chicken. I remembered the comment the receptionist made as I ordered, ""Sir, you will looove this chicken."" As the flavor hit my palette, I thought to myself, ""I do not like this chicken."" It had a freezer burn taste that's suppose to be cleaned off good fried chicken and the popular ""Nashville Hot"" flavor was wack.  I apologize for this hard criticism, but this is my honest perception - especially when a restaurant is over hyped. May it was this  bravado that contributed to the lack of attention to excellent service and good on this day. The great ones are humble, confident, and consistently excellent. I hope they were just having a bad day, because today, I have to say this place will receive a two stars from me. Cheesecake Factory is better by far. I may come back again after making a reservation ""two weeks"" in advance - by the way I am writing this review on a bench in a park near the restaurant and it still have not rained yet. I could have paid a good tip by eating at their outdoor seating, but instead they lost the tip and a good customer."
162,72,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,8/19/2021,"Came here for birthday drinks with a few friends. The cocktails were really fun - I started with a B&B Hurricane with came topped with liquid nitrogen and was delicious. I also had the Tipitina (I think) which was topped with a rock candy lollipop.

We were told that 1-2 plates per person were the norm, so as a group of 3, we got 6 items.

We got the wings with Nashville hot seasoning and white BBQ sauce. The Nashville hot was good, the white BBQ was fine but they originally made them plain and gave us the sauce on the fine. Not sure how they taste when made correctly.

We also had the pulled pork croquettes (delicious), the roasted jalapeno mac & cheese (the star of the show), the salmon hushpuppies (a special of the day. They were good, but not spectacular), and finally, the shrimp & grits (so good).

I would give them five stars BUT we ordered oysters and didn't get them for over 20 minutes so canceled them.

They did give us a very tiny cup of mocha ice cream as we were celebrating a birthday.

All in all, I would return and give them another chance. The food was good after all, a 7/10 in my book."
163,73,Buttermilk & Bourbon,2 star rating,9/19/2021,"The two stars are really only earned for the service. We ate here after hearing so many people speak of it, but honestly I wish we saved our money and went elsewhere. We ordered five items honey glazed biscuits, crawfish etouffee handpies, pulled pork croquettes, chicken sliders, and alligator hot fries. 

Honey Glazed Biscuits: Tragically the best part of the meal but that's not saying much. The biscuits are decent and have a nice blend of sweet and savory served with pimento cheese, cinnamon sugar butter, and flaky salt on top. 

Crawfish Etouffee Handpie: Do yourself a favor and skip this! This dish is just a series of flavors that don't go together. Outside wrapper is a masa dough that fries up crisp but just does not match with the cajun flavors of etouffee. The etouffee is underwhelming on its own and is mostly bell peppers and onions. The few pieces of crawfish you do get are dry and over cooked. The dish is paired with mayo and hot sauce which just adds to the taste bud confusion when eating but doesn't really add much else.

Pulled Pork Croquettes: Another skip. Nice crispy panko breaded exterior and reminds me a bit of arancini but less enjoyable. Taste is like a pork green chile served with bbq sauce than pulled pork itself. The ball is 90% rice 5% peppers and 5% pork. Textures are again nice but flavors were a total miss for us.

Chicken Sliders: If you really have to eat here, then this is not the worst thing, but it's certainly not the most amazing chicken sandwich even when comparing to the cheaper counterparts (popeyes, wendy's, etc). Chicken itself is painfully bland and overcooked. The sandwich itself relies heavily on the bacon jam and pickles to add flavor which personally made it quite bland especially when you get a bit with only chicken.

Gator hot fries: Another ""if you have to order something"" dish. When fresh I could imagine this being tasty, but this dish was lukewarm when brought to the table. Fries had started to go soggy and the gator is, again, overcooked but this time well seasoned. Didn't love the addition of the pimento cheese but overall not the worst.

Overall notes:
- food was not hot when we dined here. It was lukewarm at best for the majority of our dishes
- flavors don't pair well together 
- if you're in search of the punchy cajun flavors this is NOT your place. Save your money and go elsewhere."
164,74,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,11/10/2021,"We walked into Buttermilk & Bourbon after calling to see if there was room at the bar. They happened to have a table open they offered us if we could eat within an hour 1/2. No problem! Since highland fried closed down near us we have been looking for fried chicken to satisfy the cravings. 

The whole ambiance is super cool and feels like you've been transported out from a basement in boston to New Orleans. The staff and waiters were very attentive. We skipped the biscuits because they were only offered in tins of 4 - but I'm sure that was a mistake after seeing them pass by. 

We tried a few different dishes - they suggested 2-3 per person. We had the fried chicken (a little dry and not very crispy) and the gator fries (pretty tasty! But I wish there was more sauce). The bbq shrimp grits were maybe my favorite. I loved dipping the fries in the leftover grits. The ribs were pretty tasty as well! 

I had very high expectations for this place but overall it was pretty delicious and a great feel. I would bring visitors here for a night of small plates and drinks."
165,75,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,7/11/2021,"A friend recommended this place to me when I was in town so I went with a group and had the best time!

I always find tapas places are great for groups because they offer a wide variety of dishes for everyone to try. This isn't a traditional tapas place and they definitely don't serve traditional Spanish food but what we did have was delicious. Namely, the black eyed pea hummus, the kale salad, and the sliders. 

The food took a little longer to come out but the servers made sure they were candid about running behind and got us ample drinks while we waited. 

For me, the cocktails were the best part of the night. The drinks were creative and well balanced. I got the passionfruit cocktail and my boyfriend got a negroni. Everyone at the table ordered a second of their drink, they were all incredible. The bar program here is clearly well-run.

All in all, it's a great spot!"
166,76,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,7/10/2021,"A Garden level patio, this place is the perfect spot for a brunch with friends! 

Service was great, the tapas were large.

My personal favorites were the honey buns, and the hand pies but you couldn't go wrong with anything!"

First thing server spilled water on my girlfriend but things happen, the problem is he barely cleaned up the water at all I had to clean it up. The part that really got me is I got tequila on the rocks and a cocktail. Took Almsot 15-20 minutes to get it while the server served a new table a bottle a wine and an other table drinks before us. When I got my drink my ice in my tequila was melted and made the actual alcohol deluded. Shows that The server had a lack of awareness of when the bartender finished the drinks.  Also the food runner slammed our biscuits on the table and left. When I got my food it was fine. Food was actually very taste just we also had fly flying around our food. To top it all off when I went to tip the server in cash, I was counting the money in my wallet, he just stood there starting at me instead of taking care of his other tables VERY uncomfortable and awkward. The food was good just service it's self was very very terrible. Our server was a young man with an accent and tattoo band around his arm. I'm a bartender and have been in the industry for years. And I never had such a terrible service experience ever. I usually sit at the bar. But this sever just needs better training"

Food is stunning, both the appetizers and inside the restaurant. The ambiance is very welcoming and charming.

The decor is eclectic and the overall environment is relaxed and easy with excellent service.  The menu is diverse but not too complex. It's a lot of fun as group to order a bunch of shareables.

I was first hesitant to try their alligator fries considering it was real alligator meat but it's so yummy that I didn't care afterward. Their baby back ribs literally fell off the bone so easily (no knives or munching needed). It also had this corn mash thing on the bottom that was the perfect amount of sweet and tangy, just amazing. Their fried chicken was alright, not the best but not bad. Their beignets though, redeemed the meal again since it was absolutely to die for!!  

10/10 MUST TRY!"
173,83,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,4/26/2021,"Came here on a Friday night for a birthday! Street parking only!

The inside was much bigger than I imagined :) The food here is tapas style, I love that you can try so many things without feeling like you need to stick to just your own plate. Make sure you ask for extra utensils for serving if you need :)

We brought our own cake, they charge a $3 per slice cake cutting fee! 

Then we went on to order drinks and food. The Alligator Fries, don't question it. Just get it! The fried alligator literally tastes and feels like fried chicken. The fries though, super crispy, hot and that sauce on top, PERFECT! Get 2 if you're in a group ;)

I really liked the texture of the mac and cheese, where the cheese was super melty and not thickkkkk. The beignets were super freshhh I only wish they were as big as the ones from Cafe Du Monde :)

Overall, I enjoyed my time here :) A bit pricey but considering location and style, its about right."
174,84,Buttermilk & Bourbon,2 star rating,10/10/2021,"The BAD, the GOOD, and the UGLY.
I like to take a day or two before I review an experience in an effort to stay as fact based and as objective as I possibly can (recognizing that reviews are inherently subjective); my experience was poor as the quality of the service and the food were poor. 

I'm in Boston, hanging out with my son. His birthday was yesterday and we decided to celebrate here. Here are the highlights:

1) Parking was challenging but persistence paid off. We found a spot on the street 2 1/2 blocks away.

2) I made reservations in the Open Table app stressing that it was a Celebratory  event, and requested a nice table .

3) My son and I was shown a middle table against the wall, where we would abut to the table on either side. I requested one of the end tables as it would be more comfortable. The waitress quickly reset us. Thanks!

4. The hostess walked through at least twice and looked at me both times as if annoyed.

5. We had catfish ( B-) alligator ( B+) mac and cheese (C), and beef cheek (C).

6. My son enjoyed the alligator, me not much. The catfish is as hot, but not seasoned well.

7. No one acknowledged Justin's birthday.

8. I asked for coffee, but waited so long for 
cream. The coffee was too cold too drink.

9. The waitress made an attempt to ensure our Dining experience was pleasant, she reseated us promptly and made heart felt recommendations. The timing of the food was off but because there was a food runner perhaps that was not on her.

10. The hostess and/or Waitress acknowledging that it was a special occasion (I wrote a whole paragraph on Open Table about the importance of that night) would have gone a long long way. And if you can't seat someone where they requested, you acknowledge that and say: I see you requested so and so, but unfortunately....

11. All and all, it was not a pleasant night.

12. My feelings only: surely not what the Restaurant was trying to tell me: but I felt unimportant and taken for granted."
175,85,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,9/4/2020,"Lovely outdoor and indoor dining restaurant in Back Bay that has such unique cocktails and small plates! We had reservations at 8 and were seated shortly after. They were just turning over many tables at once so the service was slow to start. Once they got acclimated and had things under control, dinner service was smooth sailing. 

For the table we had fried chicken sliders, Mac and cheese, biscuits, beef sliders, hummus, salad, Nashville Hot chicken wings, shrimp and grits, fried calamari, and beignets. I recommend everything we had. It was just the right amount of food for 4 people. Love those Beignets!"
176,86,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,11/13/2021,This place was really good however I was expecting a brunch menu. I did not realize it was only Sunday. We got the chicken sliders biscuits and brie. The bread was a little burnt on the brie. The biscuits were amazing and so was the chicken. The brie was okay.
177,87,Buttermilk & Bourbon,5 star rating,7/26/2021,"Went for their Sunday brunch and could not have been more pleased with the outcome. We had the chicken and waffles, my wife had the cinnamon French toast, everything was absolutely AWESOME!!!

 I almost forgot about the honey biscuits, the best biscuit I have ever had!!!!!Bloody Marie's were top 5!!

This is a MUST have when you visit Boston"
178,88,Buttermilk & Bourbon,4 star rating,10/4/2021,"Buttermilk & Bourbon has been on my list for a while and it didn't disappoint!

It is so beautiful inside and the food is delicious!

We got the gator fries. It didn't occur to us it was real alligator until after eating it but that is totally fine with me and I'm impressed by the commitment to the Southern theme. The biscuits were amazing. I'd go back just for that. They were warm and flakey as you'd expect.

Buttermilk & Bourbon seems to always be busy which is a great sign for them, but definitely makes it a little difficult if you're looking to show up spontaneously or have a lot of attention from the servers. With that in mind, I thought our brunch was great. Food & drinks were prompt and delicious. What more can you ask for?"
179,89,Buttermilk & Bourbon,3 star rating,2/28/2021,"Overall decent experience. Traveling through town especially in fat tuesday I was excited to learn about this place. The chef had been on shows like top chef, bar rescue and etc. It was a top reviewed restaurant a
That was new Orleans expired. I thought what a perfect match this will be amazing! Had candied hibiscus drink. For food we had
Appetizers:
Oysters & lemon shandy poached shrimp- oysters did not taste good i actually tossed them back out. I was excited for the shrimp as I thought theyd have great unique flavor. Nope! Your typical shrimp cocktail.
Main course: crawfish risotto. Now I love Risotto and adding crawfish sound like a perfect match. Unfortunately this dish was beyond bland. It taste like I was eating bland box risotto and they threw a few pieces of crawfish & tomatoes in there. The risotto was hard and chewy I was highly disappointed 
Lastly for desserts. Had the king cake inspired beignets. & gave the breadpudding a try.
The beignets were delicious and i enjoyed the nice twist of having filling inside. 
The bread pudding however was very disappointing. This was unfortunate as bread pudding is my favorite dessert. The bread puddibg tasted like burnt coffee on bland bread heard to explain but it was gross. The first time I had bread pudding only took 2 bites"

181,1,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,4/6/2022,"Just giving an updated review. The food is still really good here. The service is exceptional. He really can't go wrong with a place like Saltie girl. I fortunately went on a rainy day so they were able to accommodate us on a walk in because eod some cancellations and missed reservations from the inclement weather. Typically they're booked out with reservations on a regular basis. 

The cod was recommended by the waitress, it was flaky, buttery, and overall delicious. The truffle fries were probably some of the best fries that I've had. I just wish that they had some more condiments like ranch on hand but no biggie. The torched salmon with avocado was a great flavor a combo, albeit small. 

Overall it was another wonderful experience at Saltie Girl."
182,2,Saltie Girl,1 star rating,4/8/2022,"If you are looking to feel marginalized, you might get that experience here.

April 2021, I went here and after being told to wait five minutes for a patio table I requested, I watched the hostess give it to another party that came after me. I thought maybe that party had a reservation and I was waiting for a different table to be set up, so I waited 10 minutes before asking the hostess how much longer it would be. Turns out the hostess wasn't planning on seating me at all and by her own admission said she completely forgot about me; she forgot I was waiting for a table even though I was standing by a tree maybe 10 feet away from her the whole time. This would have been my first visit to this restaurant and I was excited to try it after hearing good things about the food; unfortunately, because of this experience I decided I will never dine here."
183,3,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,4/4/2022,"One of my favorite restaurants in Boston. I'm only giving it 4 stars because the quality isn't consistent, especially considering the price. I find weekdays a bit riskier in ensuring you're eating the best & freshest quality they have to offer as well as differing portion amounts.

One of the star dishes in my opinion is the Raw Day Boat Scallops, but when I've ordered it during the week, they've tasted milky and off. Some of the raw oysters can also smell fishy. 

Otherwise, the food here is truly top tier on a good day. I love the Whole Fried Black Bass, Charred Octopus, Raw Tuna and Clam Chowder. Tip: add hot sauce into the clam chowder to elevate it! I was surprised at the Asian take on the bass with a very traditionally executed (and delicious!) sauce. Don't skip on dessert or cocktails either, they're just as good as the main food. The chocolate cake and brown butter cake are both moist and delectable. 

I always recommend this restaurant as a must-visit for the city. Be sure to make a reservation early, they fill up fast!"
184,4,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/31/2022,"We heard this was a must in Boston from several friends and I'm so glad we went. My parents and I seriously had ourselves a seafood feast. You could probably get the same quality at a lower price point somewhere else and I still need to try Neptune but Saltie Girl does offer reservations and we came away extremely satisfied. 

1. Clam chowder: Possibly the best chowder I've had anywhere. I grew up eating the Campbell version as an after-school snack so clam chowder holds a dear spot in my heart. This is hearty, soothing, with a chunk or two of fried clam. I saw this on every table. 

2. Boston lettuce salad: This is the salad that all restaurant salads should aspire to (looking at you, Via Carota). I am indeed that person who will wax poetic about a salad but this was heavenly - an abundance of fresh, different lettuce leaves, with thinly sliced rounds of carrots, cucumber, chicory, and other root veggies. Beautiful knife work. Light dressing. Not a single brown sliver to be seen. Did someone examine each leaf before it went on the plate? 

3. Snow crab toast: A combination of a few of my favorite things on earth. The bread was crusty, thick, well-buttered, and held up well even after we let it sit for a bit (too many delicious things on the table). Generous helping of crab, along with pistachios and stracciatella. I am drooling even as I write this. Get one or two of these for the table if a bigger group. 

4. Torched salmon belly: Grilled avocado + the tenderest salmon belly. Yes, it's $19 for a few mouthfuls of food. Yes, absolutely worth it. 

5. Whitefish salad: Of all the things we ordered, I think I could have done without this dish, if only because I've been spoiled by NY bagels and lox/whitefish. The whitefish was very salty but nicely balanced out by all the accoutrements. Try to eat this first, as the toasted bagel got stale fast. 

Service: Warm and attentive. I echo all the reviews that say they really do treat you like family here. 

The only downside to this place is the lack of parking but that's a blip on an otherwise exceptional dining experience. Can't wait to come back."
185,5,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,4/11/2022,Hour long wait just to get a few oysters on a Sunday night. We walked along newbury street until our table was finally ready. It ended up being $60 for a dozen oysters. I get that this is market pricing but it's getting a little out of hand.
186,6,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/23/2022,"For those who have not been here since 2019 (me, preCOVID). They've moved and now have lots of room and reservations!  The old location is more of a fish and chips and bar. 

Lobster roll was nice, not too buttery and the crispy roll nicely held it together. 
Really enjoyed the clam chowder. Has a hearty depth of flavor and small fried clams as a topping is a brilliant touch. 
Of course the torched salmon belly is just as good as before but has evolved in its presentation. 
Linguini and clams was ok.  More butter than I usually prefer. 
Oysters are cleanly prepared--glacier bay is mild and slightly sweet."
187,7,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/9/2022,"THIS PLACE LIVES UP TO THE REVIEWS. EVERYTHING WAS SO SO GOOD. 

Searched must-eats in the city and saltie girl was named so many times so I made a reservation a few weeks ahead of time. the staff was really friendly and answered all of our questions. I ordered the clam chowder to split with a friend and a lobster roll. the rest of my party also ordered oysters to go with their meal and they loved the oysters, especially the devon port. my clam chowder was flavorful and so creamy. I ordered the lobster roll and it was buttery and just melted in my mouth. there was ample lobster pieces in it and the bread was to die for. I will be recommending this place to everyone I know. 

please bring back the crab carbonara!! I heard and saw so many good reviews for it and can't wait to try it."
188,8,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/5/2022,"Don't come here if you're afraid to spend $$$. If not, totally check this place out and order EVERYTHING. You won't be disappointed. The service was great but the food!? Oh man. 
The oysters were the most delicious and fresh I've had in a while, loved the garlic vinegary mixture in the dropper bottle. 
My friend ordered the fried clams and the flavor was out of this world good.  
The torched salmon belly over the most gloriously torched avocado I've ever known? To die for.
Lately, the hot buttered lobster roll was so succulent and perfectly presented. Wish it came with fries but the chips were actually worth trying! We ordered the fries anyway and I tasted a hint of truffle- delicious like everything else."
189,9,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/5/2022,"One of our go to seafood / hang out restaurant in the area. 
Variety of seafood choices, all of good quality. It's fortunate they are still such a great restaurant after their expansion during the pandemic.
Uni toast, scallop, fried clam, spicy crab roll are our must orders. Also love the torched salmon belly, clam chowder, steak tartare, and tuna flatbread.
Also like their various cocktails, e.g. grapefruit and pineapple."
190,10,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/21/2022,"Saltie Girl (4.5/5)
I was in the mood for a lobster roll this weekend, so I went to Saltie Girl and sat at the bar and I was not disappointed.  This place is always packed on the weekends, so I decided to have a late lunch around 2pm, and I still had to wait about ten minutes for a seat at the bar.  The wait was worth it though!

I ordered a glass of Momo sauvignon blanc to drink which was pretty good.  I then ordered the clam chowder and a hot buttered lobster roll.  The clam chowder was very good, it came with nice bits of clam meat, potatoes, and bacon.  It was incredibly tasty, and a perfect fit for a snowy day in Boston.  Then the hot buttered lobster roll came out,  which was delicious! The lobster was dressed with lots and lots of butter in a perfectly toasted bun.  It was served with a side of Saltie girl's own potato chips.  For the price (MKT of $38) I do wish it was served with french fries, but the chips were very good regardless.

This is a spot I would definitely recommend you stop by.  I would recommend either getting a reservation or coming at an off hour to try to secure a table here.  It's a very popular place, and for good reason. I can't wait to go back for dinner one of these days!"
191,11,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/12/2022,"The seafood and drinks were solid. Came here on a Saturday evening and it did not disappoint. 

Petite Seafood Tower: it came with 6 oysters; 3 from the west coast and 3 from the east coast, as well as 2 littleneck clams, 2 top neck clams, 2 jumbo shrimps and a crab salad. The crab salad was really good and the west coast oyster was more flavorful than the east coast because it was sweeter and meatier. I enjoyed the texture and the flavor of the clams, especially the top neck.

Moules Frites: it was very good. It came with mussels cooked in white wine, garlic, butter, lemon, herbs, and topped with Parmesan fries. The sauce was very flavorful and it served well as a dip for the fries.

Overall I enjoyed the meal here and will definitely be back again to try more dishes."
192,12,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/20/2022,"Hands down the best lobster roll I have had in Boston. While pricey and a bit out of the way from Downtown, I highly recommend making at least one trek into the area to pick up an amazon lobster roll here. 

The food item looks deceptively extremely small. The bread itself is tiny and can easily fit into a child's one hand. However this thing is packed to the brim with lobster. Tasty, juicy, fresh lobster flesh. The roll was seasoned exceptionally well and definitely the best roll in Boston."
193,13,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,3/27/2022,"Saltie Girl came highly recommended to me on my recent trip to Boston. Definitely make a reservation on Resy, this place is hopping. I started with their cranberry cocktail, which was one of the prettiest drinks I've gotten at a restaurant. Their clam chowder was delicious, complemented with a fried clam on top. I was about three spoonfuls into my chowder though when my main course arrived...a warm lobster roll. I understand that all of the food is cooked to order, but I wish my main course wasn't getting cold while I finished my appetizer. While the dining room was gorgeous, the lighting gets incredibly dim after sunset."
194,14,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/21/2022,"I've been wanting to go to this place and I finally made it here for brunch with some friends. Making a reservation at least a few days ahead of time is a must! I had a great experience here - the food and cocktails were delicious and the service was exceptional. It's definitely on the pricey side, but you are getting quality food. Here's my review on the food and drinks:

Cocktails ($16/each)
I personally preferred the Grapefruit as it is sweet and fruity. The Pear would be perfect for those who likes a spicy tequila cocktail.

Oysters (~$4/each)
Plump, fresh and cleanly shucked oysters. A few of them were in pretty big shells as well. They were delicious!

Torched Salmon Belly ($19)
Absolutely loved this dish! Each piece of miso glazed salmon belly was so fatty and tender that they melted in our mouths. The char added a deep smoky flavor that was balanced out by the freshness of the avocado slices and diced apples.

Gloucester Lobster Roll ($38)
Excellent lobster roll. I got it served warm. The roll was warm and buttery, stuffed with a generous amount of fresh lobster. Our server told us it was delivered soon after we got there so you can't get any fresher than that! The lobster roll was served with a bag of chips which was good, but nothing special.

Overall, everything I got was tasty and prepared well. I've definitely had equally delicious oysters and lobster rolls for much cheaper. However, I think this place is still worth it for a special occasion if you're willing to splurge."
195,15,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,1/5/2022,"In my several visits to Boston, I've walked by Saltie Girl multiple times, and I'm so glad I finally stopped in. It was a busy Friday, but we were able to score a table in the bar area. Everything on the menu was mouth watering, but we narrowed it down to some of the best items!

We started with fresh oysters. I honestly can't remember the names of the ones we chose because there were several at the time, but the server was great about describing the taste of all of them and we narrowed it down based on that. My favorite thing was definitely the torched salmon belly. The salmon melted in your mouth and the avocado added the perfect flavor! My next favorite was the steak tartare. Oh my goodness, how it melted with every bite! The toast and Parmesan cheese were perfect addition. You can't go to New England without trying clam chowder, and I was impressed with this one. It had real clams in it and was so creamy. Lastly, we had the calamari. It was so fresh and definitely a great addition to the other choices. I hope to be able to visit again in the future!"
196,16,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,1/11/2022,"Delicious..

I came here when I was visiting Boston for work due to a recommendation from a friend. And it did not disappoint. 
The 1.25lb lobster bake with the corn and potatoes... Geez.
Cooked to perfection. Melt in your mouth. Everything you'd expect from a lobster done well.
Scallop crudo was also very good.

Oysters were solid but definitely very pricey. For that, hard to justify paying nearly 4 dollars per Oyster. Not sure what I was thinking but I went for it anyway thinking I'd be somehow blow away. It just tastes like really good oysters each with its own slight flavor. 

The table next to mine was definitely jealous when I was digging into the lobster by myself lol. It was just so good and I was just eating it well :)"
197,17,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,1/16/2022,"I honestly thought this was going to be overrated, but I was pleasantly surprised.

I got the tuna special, but had foie gras on top. Cooked rare. The tuna itself was so soft. My teeth had such a great time sinking into the meat.

The lobster roll wasn't bad. Not my favorite but not bad at all. 
They have their own potato chips! It was awesome!

The octopus was a bit rubbery.
But the real winner was the seafood tower. It is an absolute must!!

Crab was amazing, tuna was amazing, oysters and clams were great.

A bit pricey, but good experience."
198,18,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,1/22/2022,"Been reading about this restaurant for a few yrs finally made it - today's destination - with my girlfriend , son &  fiance 
Very nice restaurant, relaxed yet buttoned down  professional. Excellent service as well.

You start with today's selection of raw bar and there are a LOT of great choices offered with personal pad and pencil for type and  quantity.

We started with 12 osters, and the presentation is a 5.0 with a  lot of fine tuned  condiments. I added a few crab legs, ( very small but tasty, if you like them get at least 6) total average score  4.0.
Dishes ordered
Started with clam chowder 5.0 it's excellent , big bowl
Lox and bagel with lots of side stuff... 4.0
Fried Lobster - different really good 4.4
Lobster roll ( hot) 4.5
Galic steamed mussels 4.3
We all drank  champagne ( no. Prosecco but great alternative)
The desert menu is wanting, none of the only 3 of interest to us 
Overall, this is a great seafood restaurant and I highly recommend it."
199,19,Saltie Girl,1 star rating,12/15/2021,"TL;DR - The Torched Salmon Belly had some good flavors and was nicely balanced but was burnt. The Lobster Roll was filled with chewy claw meat. This made the sandwich not very enjoyable. The menu was uninspired, and the prices were outrageous. Meanwhile, the service left a bit to be desired. 

The brobdingnagian lambasting:

Are you kidding me?! I take my parents out to eat for a Christmas gift to this?! The sheer mediocrity is compounded by one gut punch after another that will make a return visit to Saltie Girl unlikely even if they paid me. 

One of the problems with one of Yelp's updates: it's harder to see average ratings over time. Thinking about the 4.5-star average rating, the phrase ""Lies, blank lies, and statistics"" comes to mind. 

Anyways, I am a believer that the theater starts with the cloakroom. In the case of this restaurant, you could argue this is hand-washing. The water was so cold it felt as if it were filtered through ice twice over. Not helping matters, the soap is the kind that takes a little effort to wash off. This ordinarily would be a good thing, especially in the age of COVID... but not when you can't feel them. How do you all expect me to hold a fork, eh?

For food, we decided to go for something simple. The three of us ordered the same thing: Torched Salmon Belly and a warm Lobster Roll. More on this later. 

The Torched Salmon Belly wasn't half bad! The avocado was ripe, the sauce was pleasant, and the veggies rounded everything out. The piece of salmon belly, though, was tiny! The flavors and textures were mainly good, only it may have been torched a little too much, for the crust was burnt! $19 for half an avocado and a piece of salmon belly the size of two dominoes, at best. 

Then came the $38 abomination called the Lobster Roll. Where to even start with this thing? The lobster was claw meat, a little firm but worse: chewy! With this being a sandwich, biting a piece off without dragging a whole lot more filling with it isn't possible. The meat was lightly buttered, and the inside of the bread seemed to have a little mayo, but that's it. No veggies or any other fresh elements.

I can forgive that there isn't a choice of bread (not everyone likes sweet bread), but a lack of options with the chips is much less forgivable. Salt and vinegar chips don't agree with everyone's palate. Don't like them? Sorry! 

Speaking of choice and variety... ordinarily, we love to get different things and try everything. I also love to try new and unique cocktails. With all of us getting the same thing and me passing on the cocktails speaks to their uninspired menu (though I realize this is more us than anything else).

Then there was the service. For a location of this caliber (looking at prices), I would expect the service to be top-notch, or at least above-average. For how quiet the restaurant was, the service was slow and unattentive. Then, towards the end, when they brought the payment machine, the server was looking over my shoulder as I completed the transaction (and selected the tip). The pressure, man!

200,20,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,12/6/2021,"If you're looking for a great fresh seafood spot, Saltie Girl is the place to go! They have an upstairs and downstairs area. The upstairs is way trendier than downstairs. I must say, they have the best clam chowder and warm or cold lobster rolls! The only thing I would say about the lobster roll is that I wouldn't pay almost 40 dollars for it.... Anyways, I love their fun cocktail cups too from sea horses to blowfish etc. I'd definitely recommend this spot, highly recommend and very satisfied. 

Things I ordered: 
- Clam Chowder: marble potato / salsify / bacon
- Torched Salmon Belly*: avocado / apple / cucumber / miso glaze

- Charred Octopus

The services and food was amazing . We had the dwac urchin Uni which comes out with the dropper bottle , the day boat crudo, the torched salmon belly with avocados , yellowtail crudo and the delicious branzino .

202,22,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/6/2022,"LOVE. LOVE. LOVE! In Boston for the weekend with family and had a truly magnificent experience here. Drinks were on point and presented beautifully. The Saltie martini--vodka, gordal olive, pickled onion, caviar--was fabulous both visually and in its deliciousness (highly recommend). Highlights from the meal were snow crab avocado toast, oysters (I could slurp back raw oysters), the fresh-baked bagel with pastrami lox, and snow crab legs. Simply divine, every bite. If you're a seafood lover, you can't miss here."
203,23,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,12/13/2021,"We wanted to get lobster rolls while we were in Boston and our friend who was in town about a month before us had recommended the lobster rolls at Saltie Girl. The restaurant seems to be popular during dinner hours since we were only able to find an opening at 5:30pm even though they are open until about 10 or 11pm, but it was completely empty when we went during lunch hours on a Monday. 

The lobster roll here did not disappoint and I would say this was the best lobster roll I've ever had.  You can get it chilled or hot. I got mine hot and I would highly recommend it. The lobster roll came on a soft, buttery toasted bun and there were huge chunks of lobster that were cooked to perfection. The lobster roll is always market price and it turned out to be pretty pricey since it was $38 that day (not including tip and tax), but it was totally worth it and I would come back here to order the lobster roll again the next time we're back in Boston. The server was also really friendly and did not pressure us to order drinks or appetizers."
204,24,Saltie Girl,2 star rating,2/21/2022,This restaurant truly disappointed me and left me expecting more. The restaurant is very cute and has a cute aesthetic--think pink walls and black velvet walls. The menu is mostly focused on seafood. We started with an order of oysters and were very disappointed with the quality. Then we moved on to small plates to share. We ordered the crab roll and the calamari frito and we found both to be underwhelming. The main plate was the tuna flatbread. It came covered in so much arugula and so much tomato sauce as the base. It felt so sloppy and had way too many flavor profiles. Honestly we came here with high hopes and left feeling a bit cheated. The meal here was okay and the price was high.
205,25,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,12/1/2021,"What I wouldn't give to snap my fingers and be back here at brunch! Everything we ordered outdid the last thing we had just eaten ( and boy did we order a lot), from the roasted acorn squash, to the oysters and the pastrami smoked lox and bagel, and beyond. 

Fantastic staff, Laid back environment for indoor or outdoor dining. 

Cocktails looked wonderfully, the variety of oysters was IMPRESSIVE, and the freshness of everything really makes this place stand out. Counting down the days until my next visit.

206,26,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,3/31/2022,"I ordered the clam chowder, warm lobster roll, and oysters. The clam chowder was underwhelming but not bad. A little lighter than I like it. The lobster roll was delicious and the bun was soft with just the right amount of butter. Oysters were fresh and juicy. One thing to note is the price. You're paying a premium for the quality of seafood that you're getting. It's a little hard to justify paying ~$40 for a lobster roll, but if you do decide to come, I highly recommend it. In summary, good quality of seafood at a premium price."
207,27,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/9/2022,"Really lives up to the hype! Honestly didn't try this place out for a while because it looked basic & hyped up, but it really impressed me. We came for brunch and really splurged, but really enjoyed ourselves! 
First off drinks -- we ordered a pear cocktail and blood orange cocktail. The pear cocktail was good but not much pear flavor and tasted like a margarita. The blood orange cocktail was amazing, really not like anything else I've tried! It was sweet but not too sweet and we couldn't get enough of it. 
Next up food -- highly recommend the salmon belly, clam chowder, and fried calamari. Salmon belly was amazing, great flavor and balanced out with avocado. Clam chowder was SO good, probably some of the best I've tried. Fried calamari was also awesome, loved that it was unique and had a kick in it by frying jalapeño peppers into the batter. 
Raw oysters and fries were also great! The least impressive (and most expensive) was unfortunately the lobster benedict. Quite underwhelming and definitely have had better. 
Ambience is also great! It wasn't too crowded for Saturday brunch, decor is very hip. Our waitress was also super nice and attentive, would always fill up our water when emptied and offered to change our plates twice when dirty. 
Overall a great experience! It is pricey, but a great splurge once in a while."
208,28,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,11/24/2021,"Updating my review because last night was the first time we came back since COVID!

The updates to the menu were amazing. We stuck with our oyster selections and torched salmon belly which were of course delicious. The salmon and avocado pairing is so on point. The hot sauce with the oysters is house made and pairs so well.

New items that are a must:

The moules frites were amazing! Perfectly crispy Parmesan fries and the butter sauce used to cook the mussels was insanely delicious, and also made for a nice dip for the fries. 

We finished with the lobster roll and newly the fried cauliflower both of which were delectable.

Will definitely keep coming back, check out my pictures for some photos of the new items .

The ambiance was updated to reflect the Saltie Girl vibes, as well. Felt cozy and modern at the same time."
209,29,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/10/2022,"Magical! That's honestly the only way I could properly describe this establishment. Sure, it's my first time here so maybe I'm a bit starstruck but everything was simply off the chart good. Reservations are probably needed but I was able to get a spot at the bar. The bartender was wonderful which is always a plus when you're on your own. 

I decided to get a dirty Martini as I examined the items on the menu. I opted for the cod which was served on a bed of brussels sprouts, corn, spinach purée, and beech mushrooms. It was like a book I didn't want to end. 

I saw other dishes coming out that also made me crave. The steak tartare is absolutely on my list for the next visit. Saltie Girl chips are a great treat to take home as well! Do it!"

I met a colleague there for dinner; since we didn't have a reservation we opted for the bar. It was lively and fun and the bartenders were engaging and attentive. We had a great time and a memorable meal. I can't wait to visit again."
211,31,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,11/6/2021,"Every day I think about the fried lobster and waffles that they have on their brunch menu. I had never had fried lobster before but wow was it good paired with the waffles and syrup.

I can't wait to come back and eat the lobster and waffles."

I  remember when I went a few years ago they did not take reservations and you had to sign in and wait for hours to get a table. We ordered two of each of the oysters they had available at the raw bar. We weren't fans of the oysters from Washington or Canada, but we highly recommend the oysters from Mass. and Maine. We also ordered the torched salmon belly, clam chowder, and fried lobster and waffles. The torched salmon belly was amazing, however, the ratio of avocado to salmon was very unequal unless you love avocado. The clam chowder is one of the best I've had. It is on the lighter side in terms of thickness, but full of flavor and clams. The fried lobster and waffles is a must order. The waffles are perfectly light and crispy and fried lobster is better than you expect!"
213,33,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,11/21/2021,"My sister and I ate here on a Saturday night after having made reservations at least 2 weeks in advanced as seats fill fast. Ambience was casual but also urbane, allowing you to dress up or down to your choosing. 

For appetizers, we shared the petite tower and scallop boat. We enjoyed the fresh oysters and jumbo shrimp served in the tower along with the sides of crab salad, cocktail sauce, lemon wedges, and tincture for the vinegar. However, we didn't like the clams due to the texture and taste which was no fault of the restaurants. The scallop sashimi was fresh but had a pungent citrus flavor that was honestly too much. I do prefer a squeeze of lemon over my seafood but it tasted like the scallops had been soaked. It was difficult to enjoy. 

Our entrees were the cioppino and hot lobster roll. Upon receiving our order, we found out the cioppino came with black squid ink pasta which was a fun surprise. The overall sauce was seasoned but not anything to rave about with minimal amounts of seafood. We shared the lobster roll which was filled with fresh pieces of claws, tails and more. It was served well but also not anything too unique. 

We wrapped up our meal with the French apple cake with a side of vanilla ice cream. The warm cake contrasted with the cold ice cream making for a satisfying way to end the meal. We found it to be a comfortable level of sweetness. 

Overall, the meal was decent but I was anticipating more given the difficulty of obtaining a seat and price point. Our acumen waitress was amiable and made us feel welcomed. Perhaps we didn't order their signature dishes so another visit is required for a more thorough evaluation."
214,34,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,11/21/2021,"The dining spots on Newbury are always hit or miss for me, but Saltie Girl did not disappoint! Was it the best seafood I've ever had in the area? No, but the location, the decor, and the food were all super solid, especially for brunch.

Oysters - they have a good variety of options, and the servers are really knowledgable about each one in case you're having a hard time deciding. The hot sauce and vinegar come in little droppers, which is cute but a little impractical. Still super fresh and tasty

Tuna - the sauce that it came it was a little too overwhelming and took away from the flavor and texture of the fish. Probably not the highest quality raw fish but a good option nonetheless

Eggs & eggs - soft, creamy, yummy, honestly some of the most decadent eggs I've ever had. But the TOAST!! So fluffy and lathered in butter, we were both so full but could not stop eating it.

Fried cauliflower - lowkey my favorite thing there! So crispy, tasty, really a great balance of flavors. The perfect amount of cheese, a touch of sweetness from the apple, ugh. Yum.

Of all the spots on Newbury, this is one worth stopping in for! It's popular for a reason, be sure to plan ahead and book online or put your name in in advance. Definitely recommend!"
215,35,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,4/8/2022,"Could be great, but the management and service pulls it down to a 3 star. 

Cons - Be prepared for a very rushed meal! We ordered five dishes and they brought them all at once. Overwhelming. And everything got cold. I've never seen a nicer restaurant not make any effort to course things out. The waitress and manager said that's how they operate . . . they put everything in together and serve it as it comes out of the kitchen. Sounds to me like the management is focused on turning tables as fast as possible above all else. 

Pros - The food was good to excellent. Def recommend the torched salmon with avocado, which was unique and excellent. Also like the vibe, which is loungey and fun."
216,36,Saltie Girl,1 star rating,3/28/2022,"The food was terrible. Worst seafood place ever!!! The oysters were dirty with sands and mud. We found a hair underneath the shrimp, and the waitress apologized and offered us a new order of shrimp. It costs $250 for the royal seafood tower and it gave us a really bad experience. The salmon belly was burnt and it's tasted really bad. Lastly, it's the short rib. Omg, it probably out of salt. No flavor at all. We just had two bites and will never touch it again. The waitress wants to cancel this item for us, but it's too late at that time. We already done the payment. 
Be honest, I will definitely choose another restaurant for this price point. The service was great, but I have to pack my order by myself and asked for a too go bag was disappointed. Overall, I will never come back again. The food looks good, but it tasted really really bad! I don't know why it have so many good reviews. Not worth it!!!!!"
217,37,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,1/30/2022,"Of all the stops in the city for lobster roll, this was one of the best. They do have the hot and cold option for the lobster roll, but I usually opt for the hot one and boy I was not disappointed. Very warm and buttery and served with their signature potato chips, you can't go wrong! Some raw oysters were also ordered which was very good. The uni (sea urchin) was one of the best I have had. Would definitely recommend. The clam chowder was delicious! And lastly, the torched salmon belly was pretty good. As per other reviews regarding the salmon belly, it is avocado heavy so keep that in mind. The only bad thing I guess would be that the portions did seem a bit small, but otherwise everything was perfect!"
218,38,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,1/19/2022,"- No AC in the bar area, expect to sweat.
- Do not walk in, damn near impossible to sit down in or outside without an hour wait and the bar is hit or miss but more miss than hit!
- Service don't expect nice people to greet you they're stressed and it shows unfortunately
- East and west coast oyster platter was not to my taste buds won't do it again
- Clam chowder is rich but very good and saved the day
- Lobster roll is over rated imho go to a oceanside hole in the wall shack and get a real one
- parking is a no go unless you want to hunt for a while and may have to walk far

Prob won't come back. The review hyped this place up and it didn't meet my expectations. Seems to work for others though just not my type of jam."
219,39,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,1/20/2022,"First timer and everything was excellent! From food to drinks to service. The cold lobster roll with salt&vinegar chips was soooo good. I prefer my lobster rolls on the toast buns but their bun at saltie girl wasn't so bad. We tried all of the oysters available at the time and they were all delicious and even better if you add the little vinegar and hot sauce. The fried clams were a small portion for $28. Granted they were good but not for $28. Definitely try the Pear if you want a cocktail. 

When we got our oysters, there were 2 extra oysters which we didn't understand why. Maybe some were small so they compensated and gave us extra? When we got the bill, turned out we were charged for the extra 2 oysters. The server said it was his mistake that he keyed in the order wrong so the kitchen prepared it wrong. He happily took the two oysters off the bill and continuously apologized. He was so so sweet. A+ in customer service!"
220,40,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,11/7/2021,"We sat outside on their patio on a chilly Saturday evening, which was cold even with the heat lamps on, but bearable :). 

Their warm spiced rum Apple cocktail was excellent. We shared a number of their tapas. The beet salad stole the show among the tapas. The salmon belly was pretty good but quite pricey for a very small portion. In the larger dishes, the  halibut was outstanding. The cioppino was pretty good and large although I wouldn't recommend getting the lobster as an add on. 

But all in all a very good place. I would definitely try it again!!"
221,41,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,2/25/2022,"Over price brunch, really nice decor, staffs were really nice but the food was okay. $22 for smoked salmon Benedict, the flavor was so basic. One cocktail is about $16 so we decided to order a bottle champagne with orange juice for party of 6 for $70. 

My friend order a burger, it was really good, juicy and tender burger. 

Small portion for steak and egg, we get about 5 pieces of steak with an egg. 

Their sour dough bread with butter was great, it was warm and fluffy."
222,42,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,10/9/2021,"My my, where to start. I went to college for four years in Boston and always was dying to try this restaurant and didn't get to until after I graduated and visited Boston again, and let me tell you, it's worth the hype! 

Saltie girl has the freshest, highest quality seafood, and you can taste the difference. Nestled in a corner off Newbury St, it's got a cute upscale pink marine theme and a cozy place. 

Torched Salmon Belly - this was absolutely delicious. It was fatty, fresh salmon belly laid atop a bed of perfectly ripe avocado. The salmon was one of the best salmon I'd tried. However, my one complaint is that they definitely could have given salmon belly pieces.  

Gloucester lobster roll - a New England favorite. This is a must-order here, it's a buttery hot roll stuffed to the brim with fresh hot lobster. It's market price ($38 when we went) and comes with a side of their Saltie Girl Salt and Vinegar chips. The lobster was so tender, bursting with that fresh, juicy salty lobster flavor entwined with butter. Needless to say, this was devoured in minutes. The roll is not a massive roll so keep that in mind but they don't skimp on the lobster. 

Saltie Girl Beef Burger - this is a classic burger with a chunk of fried lobster right on top. They are very generous with the portion here. Their burger was good, but personally I would not order a burger here again as their seafood is really the star of the show. The fries were also pretty average, but again, this is a seafood joint. The price was pretty hefty for this burger too, $26. 

Oysters - another must-order! They are the freshest oysters I've ever had, perfectly briny and sweet. Can't go wrong here. 

TL;DR: highly recommend for their seafood. I don't care too much for their non-seafood options but their seafood is a must! We did not order the fried lobster waffles but heard those are a must as well."
223,43,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,3/27/2022,Food was very good and the atmosphere is cool. Prices are ridicules in my opinion but it was the best lobster roll I ever had. Im from the NYC area so Im far from cheap but not just this place but Boston in general in my opinion is toooo overpriced. How ever if you don't mind spending 100+$ .. Salty Girl is worth it. Wait staff was great. And like I said the atmosphere is very cool. Parking is miserable. Makes me grateful for Manhattan or Brooklyn parking.
224,44,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,9/5/2021,"Mixed bag of pros and cons. Made a reservation 2 months in advance and looked forward to this highly acclaimed restaurant, but honestly, I've had way better. 

+ clam chowder (bacon was nice) 
+ succotash 
+ bread (super charred and topped with flaky salt) 

+/- cold lobster roll was okay, not the best I've had 
+/- decor was cute, acoustics were wack 

- service was mehhhhh. Food runners dropped off plates and didn't explain any accoutrements. No steak knife with the steak, dirty plates were taken away but clean plates were not replaced. 
- cocktails were a major letdown. They do not look cute as previously advertised. They all come in boring cups with no garnishes. 
- it's sad that the sides were better than the entrees. 
- $400 + and wasn't memorable"
225,45,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,9/9/2021,"The ambience is amazing!  Cocktails are great!  However, the kitchen closed at 8:45p and our reservation was at 8:30p.   I felt rushed in regards to placing an order.   

Ordered the halibut.  I thought it was good but not amazing.  They had limited items on the menu...I wanted to order the pizza with caviar that was on their IG.  The warm crab roll was delicious!  And I would recommend the rock crab carbonara pasta! 

The staff was beyond amazing and attentive.  We had Fritz and we loved him!  

Side street parking only....so we ubered to/from our hotel.  T"
226,46,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,9/25/2021,"The details given to each dish make this a unique place. The drinks are also quite fun. My favorite is the Bloody Mary which is served with an oyster shooter.
The charted octopus starter was tender inside and nicely spiced. The chorizo in the sauce doesn't overpower the dish.
The lobster roll was super buttery. I got the hot version. The meat was sweet and didn't even need the lemon.
The cioppino was also very unique. The cuttlefish pasta really sets off the presentation while the fresh seafood speaks to your soul!"
227,47,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,9/10/2021,"I went to Saltie Girl assuming I would order the Yelply famous Snow Crab Toast and when I took my first bite I was flummoxed--flummoxed, I say--by how freaking good it was. 

I QR coded the menu to review what could possibly be in it to be so delectable. It just says ""avocado, pistachios, stracciatella"". 

I looked up stracciatella and one site said ""it's an Italian soft cheese-a mixture of mozzarella, buffalo milk, and cream that is rich and buttery.""

That sounds yummy. Combined with the delicate crab salad, the avo, and the crumbled pistachio sprinkled on top, and the thick toasted Italian bread...it makes for one of the best things I've ever tasted. Thanks for that, Saltie Girl!"
228,48,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,8/31/2021,"One of the members of our party has a friend that lived in Boston and she highly recommended Saltie Girl. That girl ain't never lied!

The host was incredibly friendly and welcoming, really setting the tone for a great meal. We started with the French bread. It's a bit expensive for essentially a chunk of bread, and I wish it would have come in four pieces for our table of four instead of three, but it was everything. I never would have thought to add salt to bread, but it really took it to another level. The bread should come with a knife, the standard utensils at the table are no match for this bread. Do yourself a favor and get some of this!

I love carbonara and find it's not super easy to get these days, even many Italian restaurants don't seem to carry this type of dish so I was all over this and was glad that I did, I loved it. The noodles are not your traditional spaghetti and that just added to the fun and flavor.

Others had the lobster and waffles, burger, and lobster roll. Everyone left the table more than satisfied!"
229,49,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/12/2022,"Just finishing up brunch here - glad I stopped by as the Bloody Mary and food are amazing. I started off with the Bloody Mary followed by the bluefin tuna crudo, warm spicy crab roll, the chowda and torched smoked salmon belly. All of the dishes are on the smaller side (as advertised) but flavorful and of high quality. Would return here in a heartbeat."
230,50,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,8/21/2021,"My friend and I were in from out of town, and wanted our first breakfast/brunch to be a solid one. 

So happy we got to Saltie Girl just as they opened, and after a few mimosas, we had the cold lobster roll and the fried lobster and waffle dish. The latter was a recommendation from the waitstaff, and it was the perfect blend of sweet and savory that I was looking for in a brunch. 

Highly recommend this spot, and the outdoor patio was super cute too."
231,51,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,10/5/2021,"Highlights:
* Upscale seafood in a casual environment
* Only a few seats inside but plenty of outdoor seating
* The word is out so have a reservation
* Creative Presentations and knowledgable servers

The shoppers, tourists and locals on Newbery Street know some of the best upscale seafood can be found at Saltie Girl. With very limited indoor seating your best bet is to sit outside when the weather is nice. Be sure to have a reservation as the outside seating fills up fast. Inside is a quaint Back Bay brownstone with a few booths and some bar seating.

We started with some Perrier Jouet Champagne and Momo Sauvignon Blanc available by the glass and a great accompaniment to a dozen fresh littleneck clams served with cocktail sauce, lemon, house mignonette and house spicy sauce. Next up was the Torched Salmon Belly with avocado, apple, cucumber and miso glaze. The Shima Aji, aka striped jack, may have been a special, and was quite good. Day Boat Scallop Crudo was served with Caviar, jalapeño, lime and avocado and reasonably priced at $18 for a caviar dish. Fried Lobster and Waffles is a signature dish served with sweet corn butter and spicy maple syrup $32. The Spicy Crab Roll, two pieces of crab rolled with avocado and sesame coated soy paper $28, was delicious as was everything else. 

We could not leave Boston without sampling the clam chowder, as we did all around town. Saltie Girls' is certainly in the top 5, made with salsify and bacon. For dessert our waiter suggested the Fig Tart, fresh roasted figs served over a pastry shell and topped with ice cream and an edible flower.

If you are visiting and only have time to try a few seafood restaurants, be sure to put Saltie Girl on your list, space and weather permitting."
232,52,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,12/29/2021,"We came here on a recommendation of a friend. Honestly, I probably would have liked this place more if I came with my bf and just shared a platter of oysters and enjoyed a cocktail, rather than coming here with my family. The portions are small, especially for the price, and you shouldn't come here starving without ordering a lot of food.

Location: Easy to find in Back Bay. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, but this place does get crowded.

Ambiance: Trendy, can get loud.

Service: Service was ok. Maybe I got the vibe our waitress was disappointed we only ordered one dish per person and got water (I was hydrating for my marathon, so no alcohol for me). It was borderline uninviting.

Food: I ordered the snow crab toast, my sister ordered the fried lobster and waffle, my dad got the lobster roll, and my mom ordered the king crab roll and chowder. All of the food was good, but the king crab roll was a disappointing portion size, especially for the price.

Price: Trendy comes with a price.

Would I return? Maybe if it were for a date night or to try the cioppino, which looked really good."
233,53,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,8/26/2021,"Something about the humidity and not having airflow in the bar area made me want to leave early. Those poor employees. 

The clam chowder was good, but on the thin side. I like mine a bit chunkier. 

I also ordered the snow crab toast and I don't understand the hype. The crab and toast were good separately. But too acidic. Pistachios? stracciatella cheese? Avocado? Honestly, If you're a fatty like me, I would pass on this. A lot of people like it, so try it, I guess?? To each their own."
234,54,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,12/12/2021,"This place gets booked fast! Make a reservation and be sure to try the lobster roll. Took a trip here to relax and see the sights. The passion fruit cocktail is strong but refreshing. I can't wait to go back when the weather warms up a bit. 

The vibe is cool and you can dine in or out. The bar scene is perfect for a meet and greet or date night with bae. 

Get here!"
235,55,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/24/2022,"I'm very impressed by the food, especially fried black bass, huge and solid with Asian fusion taste. I ordered pineapple rum cocktail that is perfect with seafood we ordered tonight. Only one dish not recommended is sea urchin, a little fishy because it's from New England. You can get better one in Japanese restaurant. Other than that, everything is exceptional!"
236,56,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,2/17/2022,"WOW!!! I cannot wait to come back. The burger was full of so many bursting flavors. The pork belly was the best I have had. The lobster was a fantastic edition. I enjoyed the vibe and quiet, elegant hum throughout the restaurant."
237,57,Saltie Girl,2 star rating,9/18/2021,"I'm sorry, but this girl is now very saltie.  We came in here with high expectations given the ratings and while most of the food was above average and decently priced, there were two major issues.  
Most importantly was the service.  It took a long time to order and the waitress rarely checked in on our table.  They were also out of multiple dishes on a Saturday night.

The stuffed lobster was ridiculously priced at $65/lb and again not poor in quality, but nowhere near the return in value.  

The menu is also not friendly to those with a nut allergy per the waitress, even though no nuts are listed on the menu. 

Boston is a great city with many restaurants and I guarantee you'll find better elsewhere."
238,58,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,7/5/2021,"Came back here again when was back in Boston to visit. This time was for lunch and the experience was way better than the first time. 

We ordered oysters, snow crab toast, warm lobster roll, uni quail egg and caviar (sushi?), and grilled octopus. 

Oysters were fresh. The snow crab toast was the best I've had- It was so so so good! I am not a bread person but the toast was so good, crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside with a nice smoky taste. I would go back just for the snow crab toast. The lobster roll was so delicious that I forgot the take a picture before chowing it down. The sea urchin with quail egg and caviar was good but could've been better, I think they used too much rice, which overpowered the goodies. The octopus wasn't my favorite, was supposed be an appetizer but came in the very end. 

Service was decent."
239,59,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,9/6/2021,"Fresh seafood and nice atmosphere sitting outside. Service was superb. Brook was our sever and she was super friendly and helpful. She was knowledgeable and gave us great recommendations. We ordered oysters (amazing), avocado with charred salmon, raw salmon with jalapeño and urchin from Japan. 
I highly recommend it although it's very pricey."
240,60,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,12/8/2021,"We stopped here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. No wait and quick service. The interior was so cute and well designed/laid out. We had the warm Lobster Roll and the Fried Calamari. The bread for the Lobster Roll was amazing and the meal came with a bag of salt & vinegar potato chips. The Fried Calamari was the best part though, served with a delicious aioli and Spanish chorizo - so much flavor!

It did seem a little over-priced for the taste/size, but it could have been based on what we ordered. Next time I would order from the crudo menu or a seafood tower (someone ordered this next to us and it looked delicious!)"
241,61,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,12/14/2021,"I've been here twice - once for take out and the other time for dining in. Saltie Girl has the best tasting Lobster roll I've tried so far in Boston (and I've tried 8 different spots now) - but it's definitely on the pricier end. 

Service 
- When I dined in, we were seated promptly and service was friendly. Waitress answered a lot of questions we had about the menu since a a number of items were marked as market price 
- We did get the wrong food delivered to our table a few times throughout the night - not a huge deal, but we did have to instruct the servers a few times.  

Atmosphere 
- The interior has pink paneled walls and a nice view onto the streets of Back Bay. Would describe the ambiance as cute and classy 

Food 
- Lobster roll comes on a hot, buttery bun with a side of chips in a bag. Lobster is delicious and the freshness of the taste definitely comes through. It is, however, $38, which is the most I've paid for a lobster roll in Boston 
- For starters, we also ordered the shishito peppers, which were not spicy at all and nicely charred. My favorite appetizer had to have been the roasted squash. SO GOOD. Would come back just for that. 
- We also ordered the burger, which was delicious. Thick, juicy beef patty with lots of cheese. 
- Wine selection was good and glasses were fairly priced 
- Two of my friends got the 2LB baked stuffed lobster, which I believe was just under $150. Presentation was beautiful but not sure if it was worth the price. 

Overall, this is a solid spot for date night or a fancier night out, but expect it to be on the pricier side"
242,62,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"Being new to Boston what better place to eat than seafood off Newbury street. It's a fairly popular place, so we put down our names for a table and got a text pretty soon afterwards for a table. 

For drinks they have a decently long wine list as well as beer. My friend got a couple glasses of cava and seemed pretty content with that. 

For the food, we splurged for the seafood tower as well as a couple of other entrees, the snow crab toast, diver scallops, and the lobster roll. Dunno how we finished but we did. 

The grande seafood tower, market price was $150 that day. It included shrimp and crab cocktail, truffled lobster salad, tuna poke, east and west coast oysters as well as small and large neck clams. We discovered we were not a fan of raw clams, but the oyster selection was pretty good. 

The snow crab toast was amazing. Large pile of snow crab on a bed of avocado and creamy stracciatella. The bread itself was great - buttered, seedy, and toasted. The diver scallops were also a winner especially if you like fried seafood. The tartar sauce was one of my favorites and the scallops were crispy on the outside but perfectly succulent and tender on the inside. Seasoning for the scallops and fries were just perfect. 

I'm indifferent to lobster especially since I've been in Maine for the last couple months, but that's not to say that this lobster roll wasn't good. Drfinitely"
243,63,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,6/21/2021,"I came here with my girlfriend and we started off with the raw bar, choosing a few oysters and shrimp cocktail. The raw bar was my favorite item, and all the seafood items were really fresh. We then split the charred octopus, seared tuna flatbread, salmon belly, and artichokes for dinner. The octopus was essentially octopus in a bowl of marinara. It could have used a little more seasoning. The salmon belly was good, but you get a really small portion for the price you pay. The tuna flatbread was essentially a pizza with tuna and a lot of arugula on top. 

For the hype that this place gets, and how expensive some of the dishes are, I think there are better spots in the city that are worth the money. Overall, the food was good, but I don't think it was worth the price."
244,64,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,12/14/2021,"My friend and I came here for lunch. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. My friend got the cider cocktail, which was good. We both got the lobster rolls, and had it cooked warm (you could pick between warm or cold). The lobster was very good on a brioche roll. It was a little too buttery for my taste but my friend loved it! The rolls come with salt and vinegar chips, but you could substitute if you wanted. It is on the pricier side, I just got the lobster roll, no drink, and after tip, it cost about $50."
245,65,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,12/1/2021,"Convenient spot for sure, but you pay for it. The chips made in-house were ok, but a nice novelty- could have been a little more crispy. Oysters were delicious but a little on the expensive end. Truffle fries were AWESOME- highly recommend.

All in all, a great atmosphere and I'd recommend this for a stop on your shopping day."
246,66,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,11/8/2021,Saltie Girl expanded significantly in space ever since it moved to this new location. It's a lot easier now to get a seat and -- contrary to my previous review -- they now have updated to the modern day reservation system. That's a significant plus. See my pictures for recommended dishes.
247,67,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,1/3/2022,"Haven't went back in a while but I went there today and the decor and ambience has completely changed! Everything looks fancier and high-end, very pretty. 

Food-wise, everything was still super great! I got their hot lobster roll, lobster & waffles and cod and they were all great. My favorite is always their lobster and waffles though with the delicious mix of sweet and savory from the maple syrup and butter. 10/10!"
248,68,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,4/11/2022,"Just a quick dinner at the bar to enjoy a 'last night in Boston' lobster roll.  Very happy with our choice- had the warm roll, sooo good.  Had a side of fries- home cut variety.  Great service at the lower bar and great food."
249,69,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,11/24/2021,"Wow! Really impressed by the seafood food and drinks here, and definitely would come back! 

If you're looking for a fun day-time brunch with friends or even a casual-yet-elevated dinner date (think 3rd date vibes), I highly recommend. The food is spot-on; the ambience is fun and flirty (pink walls, leather cushioned booths, chandelier in the entrance); the price can climb quickly though! 

Here's what I had (and recommend!):

[Cocktail] Blood Orange - Very fruit forward! Texture is like a light smoothie. And if you like drinks that don't have an alcohol finish, you'll be a fan. My other friends tried the apple and fig cocktails. The impression I had from their experience was that the apple is perfect if you want a spiced, warm hard apple cider, and the fig is perfect for a more bourbon-forward/complex drink.  

[Appetizer] Torched Salmon Belly - My three friends and I split this one. To be honest, it's a very small plate. Think palm-sized salmon topped with sliced avocado. It is one of their more popular appetizers, and I enjoyed the taste. Just keep in mind the portion size! 

[Entree / Large Plate] Fried Lobster & Waffles - Awesome! I'm such a fan and would recommend to anyone who goes. The fried lobster had a great texture and the flavor still comes through! And waffles and spicy maple syrup really adds an elevated touch and makes brunch that much more enjoyed. Don't worry about the spice though - it's not that strong! 

Overall, 5/5! Would highly recommend to friends and family! Just keep an eye on the final price."
250,70,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/9/2022,"Upscale seafood dinner, on point!

Came for dinner on a Monday night in March 2022, everything was amazing -

West Coast oysters, raw
Torched salmon belly
Lobster roll - we are firm believers in the warm with butter, and this was inline with the one from Neptune's oyster ($38 was the Saltie Girl market price, when we came)
Moules Frites - this is bathed in a luscious white wine Butter sauce, emphasis on butter. This is a full on entree to share, the butter sauce was so luscious and indulgent, with a hint of chilis to give it the perfect balance. Mountain of fries served on top, with parmesan- somehow it all works. 

Will be back!!"
251,71,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,5/11/2021,"Enjoyed a wonderful mother's day lunch at Saltie Girl this past weekend. They expanded their original tiny restaurant into the Met space and started taking reservations this past year. The service, food, and ambiance were all top notch. We ordered a variety of dishes including: 

1. Steak tartare (Definitely get this! Delicious, creamy, and generous portion)
2. Torched salmon belly (Salmon was great but I would pass next time, nothing special and small portion compared to the other dishes)
3. Day boat scallop crudo (YES, order it. This was my favorite dish, the texture of the scallops was so smooth and fresh)
4. Uni toast (Would order again but pricey, get this if you are an uni fan)
5. Lobster roll (Decent lobster roll but would not order again unless you are specifically in the mood for one. Comparable to other restaurants in Boston) 
6. Rock crab carbonara (Order if you are looking for something more filling and creamy) 
7. Upside down strawberry rhubarb cake (I would pass on this next time, not my cup of tea)

We also ordered a mimosa and the frozen espresso cocktail. The latter was so so delicious and boozy. 

Overall, definitely worth it and I will be coming back!"
252,72,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,12/14/2021,"The chilll wore off soon as those drinks came! Enjoyed a dirty gin martini and the Pear cocktail. Lots of windows and an early reservation required a bundle up but like I said....get your drink and it'll be warm in no time!! Loved the lobster n waffles and the cioppino. Very fresh cuttlefish pasta and shellfish with loads of flavor!! Maybe choose the longest on a cold day or maybe turn up the heat. Today was a milder day. Wonder what its like on really cold day!! 
Enjoy!"
253,73,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,6/8/2021,"Overall, had a good experience and the food was tasty.

Not unexpected, but it's definitely pricey (Lobster Roll was $38 at Market Rate this time) which was more than I expected. Would be nice if it came with fries instead of chips. Probably wouldn't get it again for the price, even though it was tasty.

I really enjoyed the waffle from the Lobster and Waffles. Honestly was one of the best waffles I've ever had. The Fried Lobster was an interesting item to experience...though I think when it's fried, it really looses the distinct ""Lobster taste"" that I'd expect

The Clam chowder was delicious! First time having a clam chowder with fried clams, so was quite the treat.

The drinks were well blended and tasty. And when I ordered one that was a bit too bitter for me, they gladly added some simple syrup to it for me.

And the Lemon Florentine cake dessert was good as well. Definitely full of lemon flavor for sure. I wish it would have been more moist, but it was still tasty."
254,74,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,5/18/2021,"Saltie Girl serves delicious seafood and drinks in the heart of back bay in Boston near Copley square. Outdoor seating available for walk up only, you can only reserve for indoor dining. The lobster roll is in my opinion the best you will find in Boston, seriously, their hot lobster roll is addictive I haven't even managed to try the cold one. They also serve it with house made salt and vinegar chips which is always a nice touch.

If you're not up for the lobster roll, I recommend the chowder and the mussels which is served with divine bread- the sauce is delicious! They also have a great array of oysters from across the US

To finish it off, the chocolate mousse between layers of filo is decadent and the perfect amount of sweet. 

For drinks I love their cocktails - both the grapefruit and the watermelon are delicious. 

You can't go wrong here, excellent staff/service and even better food! It's worth the hype and price.

255,75,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,11/4/2021,A friend recommend for us to try Saltie Girl while visiting and we're glad we did. The seafood was super fresh and the interior was the perfect ambiance for a date or brunch with your girlfriends. The price is a bit higher in the area but you are paying for a more upscale atmosphere as well! I loved the refreshing cocktails and lobster roll - would love to try the clam chowder and crab toast next time!
256,76,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,7/3/2021,"This is one of my favorite places to go when I'm in Boston! I love it so much I break my rule about not visiting places more than once in cities I do not live in, but I make an exception since I went to grad school at Northeastern. 

Every bite and sip we had in this place was phenomenal. 

The service is impeccable and so friendly. We recommend sitting at the bar so you can watch the action and magic happen. 

Now let's talk food. Oh, the lobster roll. First off, there is so much lobster in this roll it is worth the cost. The toasted buttered roll is overflowing with lobster. The potato chips are not your regular chips either. These are perfectly salted and crispy. 

We had the market fish, and it was out of this world!! The sauce and the chutney on top perfectly complimented every soft bite of the fish. 

Last but not least, we had the snow crab toast. There was so much snow crab with pistachios, avocado, and stracciatella. The toast was buttered and toasted to crispy perfection. 

I do not recall the drinks we had as I forgot to take pictures, but I'm sure it was on their cocktail menu, and it was delectable."
257,77,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"For drink i started with the cranberry, which was fruity and refreshing. And for entree I got the steak tartare and i would definitely come back for this! I'm a cheese lover and I already knew I would love it, but it was the brioche and the steak that got me hooked. Ended the meal with the black and tan tart, which was also delicious and not overly sweet."
258,78,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/30/2022,"If you love yellowtail, then the yellowtail at Saltie Girl is a perfect choice. A favorite of mine while traveling in Boston. Must try! The salmon belly had a great smoky taste but mine was a bit cold so wasn't sure if that's how the fish was suppose to come out. Otherwise the margaritas were delicious and the location was perfect"
259,79,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,10/16/2021,"Tried to get reservations and could not so we just dropped by hoping to get a table outside. We were told 30min wait but got a table within 10mins. The place was busy while it was not packed. We had two small plates and shared an entree. We had the salmon belly and the crab toast. The salmon belly was good, the crab toast needed something, there was a lot of crab which was great but it needed something to kick it up. The bread was tasty. Next we shared the hamburger which was pretty good. We also had a grapefruit cocktail and a pineapple cocktail both were awesome. The service was pretty good and the waitress was knowledgeable. The seafood is definitely pricey."
260,80,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,6/20/2021,"Amazing seafood! Saltie girl has a reputation and they definitely live up to it. Ever since they expanded and took over the Met it's been easy to get in or place a reservation.

Our waiter was hilarious, I don't remember his name, but service was great. We ordered the following:

Tuna crudo ($16)
Salmon belly ($19)
Saltie girl burger ($26)
Dessert - can't remember maybe $12

The salmon belly is sooooo goood! A must! The tuna was also great but it had these little pickled mushrooms that overpowered the flavor of the dish. We took them off and I think they have changed it anyways. The burger was super good and also extremely rich. I'd have a hard time eating the whole thing so I'm glad we shared it!

Overall, Saltie Girl has amazing food and it's a great date spot in Boston. It's a little expensive to frequent often but I'd highly recommend trying it if you are visiting Boston!"
261,81,Saltie Girl,2 star rating,10/11/2021,"Soooooooo it's a no from me. My friend said this place is a must go to. So this was my first meal the second I got to Boston. Umm.. NO!!! Save your money. 

We made resos a week in advance. Arrived on time and we're seated quickly. My friend and I were starving!!! We ordered 2 cocktails and put in an order for appetizers while we looked and narrowed it down on our end. 

We ordered the petite seafood platter- HORRIBLE. I live for seafood and just no. The shrimp was over cooked/over boiled and was beyond chewy. The clams and oysters were so Sandy they were not edible. And then the lobster salad was so salty we left it as is. 

We also got the uni- 5/5 this was very edible and delicious. 

2 food items and 2 cocktails and we were already over 200$ we asked for the check immediately and we were out in 20 minutes scrambling to find a new dinner spot."
262,82,Saltie Girl,3 star rating,11/9/2021,"I decided to come here yesterday for lunch as I love tinned seafood and this place has an abundant selection.  I find the menu intimidating so I asked the bartender for help.  The Snow Crab Toast was huge and bland tasting.  Pretty much tasteless Crab and Avocado on a huge slab of toast.  The tinned Mussels in Lemon were ok.  The slabs of bread are huge which takes away from the fish and other parings in my opinion.  The Italian Cab was mediocre.  The Bartender was nice but I could tell he was overworked.  I'm not sure I'd return as I wasn't impressed with the food, but the atmosphere is nice.  The drink menu also left a lot to be desired."
263,83,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,3/31/2021,"OKAY YUM. Keep Saltie Girl in mind when you want to splurge on a meal because this place can get expensive, but is a must try! I mean it is seafood AND on Newbury St so you must have known it would be $$$. Just FYI they are currently serving at Met Back Bay. 

We made reservations on a Sunday at 4 and it was BUSSSSY. Parking was tough. Get here early so you're not driving around frantically looking for parking 5 minutes before your reservation like I was lol.

Everything was delish. I wish our fries were more crispy and wish they had brought our apps out before our main meal, but I won't take a star out for that. It was so good - make your reservation now!"
264,84,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,4/12/2021,"Back again! My friend and I were shopping on Newbury Street and wanted to get the saltie girl burgers to eat in one of the parks, so we ordered for pick up. Wait was around one hour, according to the delivery app we used, and when we went right on time, the order was already ready.

Fries unfortunately were not hot and crispy the way they were in-restaurant, but the burger was still good even though it was kind of lukewarm already. They packaged everything in a way that made it kind of hard to eat the burger -- and forgot to give us any utensils or napkins. We went back and got some once we realized that they were missing. Everything was still good, but I definitely won't do delivery/pick up again, since the food tasted only ~70% as good as it normally does!"
265,85,Saltie Girl,5 star rating,11/17/2021,"Hailed as a trendy brunch/seafood spot, we had to come try and see what the hype was about. While a bit pricey, the seafood is fresh and portions are ample. I opted for a classic hot lobster roll with their signature vinegar and salt chips and my partner got the lobster and waffles. 

Lobster roll was buttery, oozing with lobster and mayo (sorry if that was slightly graphic). Perfectly seasoned with lots of lobster meat. Chips were yummy and not much else to say beyond it was a damn good lobster roll. 

Lobster and waffle on the other hand, was an otherworldly experience and a MUST TRY! Corn butter with spicy batter fried lobster atop soft and crunchy waffles? And maple syrup? No other way to describe the flavors aside from they were all there and perfect!! 10/10 recommended!"
266,86,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,5/23/2021,"Got the warm lobster rolls and they were really good! I love that they were served on a brioche bun which made it so much tastier, and had the perfect amount of butter. However, the lobster roll was extremely small and not filling at all, so it was most definitely not worth the price tag at all. 

The salt and vinegar chips also disappointed me. While the texture of the chip was great, the vinegar taste was extreme strong and the chip itself was just WAY too salty, so was not a huge fan of those."
267,87,Saltie Girl,2 star rating,10/6/2021,"Two stars is generous. Sorry to say, but I looked at several menus in the area and figured this looked good. Super disappointed. A bad day is one thing but there was sooo nothing special here. I had visions of deliciousness and at the end of my meal - I was pretty bummed out that I didn't order lightly and get something yummy elsewhere. Walls and baseboard were a little dirty and unappealing too, sorry but in the daylight it was just not what I imagined after finally trying this place after seeing the high ratings. Here is the steak tartare I got from there vs a small french restaurant in Hyannis...flavors paled in comparison. I may have to drive to the Cape. 
I get it..  rent on Newbury St isn't cheap, but flavor and flair isn't expensive, it keeps them coming back. Sorry for the review but really disappointed!"
268,88,Saltie Girl,2 star rating,10/6/2021,"Going to keep it short and to the point - service was okay. Food was meh- I had high expectations of this place because the reviews are great on here. Wasn't impressed and the prices are astronomical, in my opinion, for no reason. Portions aren't reasonable for the price. Not understanding the hype? Steak tartare was ok.... Needed capers or something, lacking flavor. Snow crab toast, appeared better than it tasted, very bland. Moules and frites? Okay- again bland. Over a $200 tab and not memorable whatsoever. 

Disappointed... Not even going to post the pictures because the presentation appears better than the food tastes."
269,89,Saltie Girl,4 star rating,3/5/2021,"My friend and I were looking for a last minute reservation for good seafood and I'm so glad we found this place! It was very easy to book online. Note that they have moved to the building next door. We almost turned back because the door with the sign is actually closed. No worries, we called them and realized they're just next door. 

We were seated in the basement. It was pretty dim. All the staff wore masks and were very nice. The menu has a lot of delicious sounding items and it was very difficult to decide what to get. After our server's recommendation, we decided on Snow Crab Toast and Lobster Rolls. 

Snow Crab Toast: oh my, this is an elevated avocado toast. It is actually pretty tall. It has layers of avocado, cheese and crab. Drizzled with pistachio and olive oil. It was absolutely delicious. 

Lobster Roll: ok can we just appreciate the custom packaged chips? The lobster roll looks small in size, but don't be fooled, the buttery lobster is actually pretty hefty serving. The roll was so fresh and soft. Almost melt in the mouth. 

+1 for amazing service. I had plenty of water refills, and trust me that's not too common during covid. 

Taking one star off because the food is upscale and a little on the pricey side, however the basement vibes definitely did not match the upscale feels they're going for."
270,0,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/25/2022,"The size of this location is pretty standard for a ramen shop. The menu is smaller than the larger Cambridge location but all you need is a good bowl of Kara miso ramen. It comes in three different sizes. Small, regular, and large (sizes changes are +/- $1). To make the bowl complete, add an egg for $2. Usually there isn't enough meat for me so I order an extra side of meat (only when I order a large, I don't need it when I get a regular)

If dining in is still not in the cards for you, don't worry they have takeout and delivery options. They package it very nicely in a single container and provide a nice soup spoon and chopsticks. It is so space efficient, I should've taken a picture but I couldn't restrain myself. They wrap it in plastic in case it spills during transit as well! The noodles, veggies and meat are in the upper compartment while the soup base is at the bottom of the cup (a big soup cup)."
271,1,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,3/30/2022,"The hard working staff here deserve a shout out. Their job looks exhausting, hustling to get people in and out while still maintaining quality. They all did it tirelessly. 

Other than that, this experience was alright. Long wait for pretty good ramen. There's more or less one vegetarian ramen. Upcharge to add an egg. This ramen had some tasty things about it, but the broth unfortunately fell into the trap of bland veggie broths. I think this is a good benchmark for quality, since it takes effort to make flavorful veggie broth.

Space is tiny. You will be literally brushing elbows with strangers. If your party isn't large enough for its own table, you will share. This is fine and didn't put a big damper on my experience. But be advised you will wait and if you are still at all covid cautious, this one is very much not for you."
272,2,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,3/27/2022,"Good ramen, but generally overrated. Does not compare to ramen you could find in NYC or California. The noodles are prepackaged and some of the broths have an underwhelming flavor. The vegetarian ramen is pretty disappointing. I did enjoy the shio broth. Although I wish they would be a bit more generous with toppings, I usually leave here full.

It is often busy during lunch time and you can expect a small line. The staff will try to get you in and out so they can free up seats for the next customer. The food does come out fast, so for a quick, satisfying lunch that won't break the bank, it's not a bad choice."
273,3,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,3/6/2022,"We went to the Newbury St location and we waited from 8 to 8:30 in line last Saturday night for two people. No reservations because they know they're that good. It's quite a small shop instead so be prepared to wait. I thought the ramen was definitely some of the better ramen in Boston but doesn't compare to NYC area ramen. Then again the NYC ramen prices are extravagant compared to this $15 filling meal, tip and tax included. I really enjoyed the soup which was hearty and went really well with the noodles. Not to be picky, but I some minor improvements are as follows (sorry, I'm a ramen connoisseur in training): 
- the pieces of pork were very dry and there were only two gum sized pieces. 
- the noodles themselves didn't have the super bouncy texture of superior quality ramen."
274,4,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,4/7/2022,"Parking took 40 minutes to find and the we waited another 40 minutes to dine in. The space inside is very small so seating is limited, hence the reason why there will probabaly be a line almost everytime you go because of how popular this location is.  We ordered what we wanted before seating inside through the waitress and when it was finally time to sit in, food arrived in less than 5 minutes. They have three sizes for the bowls of ramen for those that want less or more. I was extremely satisfied with my dish as it was super flavorful and the noodles were perfectly chewy. I highly reccomend the shio broth as it had a more rich flavor than the shoyu ramen. The chashu was soft and juicy which suited well with the broth."
275,5,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,2/22/2022,"I didn't find anything particularly special about this ramen. The noodles were not particularly thin or refined, the toppings on the basic bowl are rather sparse - but luckily that is reflected in the price. I didn't think the broth had much flavor beyond being salty. The best part of the dish was probably the pork belly, the fish cake was a sad distraction.

It's a tiny place with no real place to hang up your coats, so eat precariously!"
276,6,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,1/12/2022,"Our party of 3 waited for an hour in the cold but it made the bowl of ramen that much more tasty!! 

It's a really small store which is why the wait can be longer. 

The spice level was great & the texture of the ramen was chewy (how I like it). The egg was runny and the broth was delicious! I opted for a size large and I almost finished it... especially since we were waiting outside in the cold for a while

Our friends and I all enjoyed our ramen bowls!"
277,7,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/5/2022,"Probably one of my favorite ramen places here in Boston but nothing will beat Ichiran in New York . 

Very small place. Probably 6-7 tables max and probably a 6 seater on the counter top. Be prepared to wait to be seated because the line is always long. I usually stick to the spicy miso with corn and egg on the side. I really wished they had more veggies in the ramen for example bean sprouts . But it's a must try!"
278,8,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,4/5/2022,"We ordered the combo ramen with 2 side items. I got the karamiso (spicy broth), chashu gohan (rice bowl with pork), and Ajitama (marinated egg). The broth was perfectly spicy and rich. Gohan was simple but very solid in flavor. Egg flavor was also amazing and cooked to perfection. The combo was very reasonably price and more than enough to fill you up. One of my favorite ramen places in Boston thus far!"
279,9,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,10/31/2021,"Came here on a whim when we were in Boston. It was not on my radar at all when I did all the research for where to go eat but we walked by it on the way back to the hotel one day and saw the line of people waiting outside so we decided to check it out for lunch on our last day in Boston. 

We waited about 25min before being seated. The tables are extremely tight and you're most likely seated with others since they don't have individual tables. We were disappointed that this was some kind of express location and most of the dishes we wanted to order weren't available. We got the Kara miso ramen which was pretty good, especially after waiting in line outside on a cold fall day. We also ordered the mazeman (dry ramen dish) because I read some reviews that raves about it. I didn't care for it at all - it was too salty and just very blah. 

Service was friendly and speedy, prices were super reasonable, and the bathroom was super clean and surprisingly huge considering how small the restaurant was as a whole. I would be interested in visiting its other locations with the full menu in the future."
280,10,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"This is my favorite ramen place in Boston/ Cambridge area. They serve delicious ramen, which explains the long wait times/ queue even in the chilly Boston winters.
Highly recommended!!"
281,11,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,3/28/2022,"First time in Boston, first stop. Very delicious. I've been to Hokkaido's near LA, not the best. Very small and intimate shop, Good ramen noodle soup. Thank you Santouka."
282,12,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/21/2022,"The ramen here was absolutely delicious - every element blew us away! The broth was amazingly flavorful, the noodles had the right amount of bounce and chew, and the chashu was savory and tender. We got the large tonkotsu shio ramen and small tonkotsu miso ramen, and we loved how we were able to customize the size accordingly. So glad we stopped in during our walk through Newbury Street. The warm soup definitely hit the spot on such a cold, windy day."
283,13,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/15/2022,"I stopped by Santouka in a middle of running errands on a cold wintery day. There was around 30-minute wait to get inside. As commented in prior reviews, the Back-Bay location is very small (seats around 16-20 people at a time). Santouka's ramen might be my favorite in Boston and has great value (around $10-12/ramen, and extra 2-3 for other toppings)

Atmosphere (4/5):
The space is small and crowded, with you sharing either the table or the bar space with other parties. There is not much decoration, but it is cute, efficient and serves its purpose of churning out delicious ramen quickly.

Food (5/5):
Really delicious authentic ramen. I got the shoyu ramen with additional aji-tama(soft boiled egg with extra $2). You have the option of either small, regular or large portion, which was wonderful to be able to customize. The baraniku(pork belly) cha-shu literally melts in your mouth, and is a beautiful savory explosion. The egg is also perfectly done. The broth is not overly salty with a rich and complex pork flavor and with great ratio of noodles/soup. The thin noodles were fresh and cooked to the perfect al dente consistency.

Service (5/5):
The staff are really attentive and super friendly. They checked everyone's vaccination card and were efficient in taking orders and getting the food to the table. I was in and out of the place within 30 minutes."
284,14,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,8/22/2021,"Hm.

Honestly I was really excited for this place. Lines always out the door. Good reviews. 

I wasn't all that ""wow""ed. You know? 

Broth for all soups was just meh for me.
Nothing popped out. It didn't feel silky, wasn't too flavorful, and it was a bit heavy.

Noodles didn't make me feel like they came together with the broth either. 

Charsiu pork had no char, no flavor.

Don't get me wrong, the broth wasn't bad, it just didn't taste the best. 

I will try the location again, maybe the other location. Maybe I had a bad day."
285,15,Santouka Back Bay,2 star rating,7/16/2021,"I saw the line the day before and decided that I need to try this place!

I got 2 pork bowl and 1 spiciest ramen

I'd say the food was not that great :( the service was just okay but at least we got the food fast enough."
286,16,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,3/19/2022,"A close friend of mine has been raving about this place for a long time. So you know that she had to take me here when I came over to visit her. There's going to be a line practically at practically any time, but it does move pretty quickly. Also, the place is small and you'll end up seating next to strangers at either the bar or the tables. 

I tried the spicy miso ramen and it was good. Nice broth and noodles, but the chashu could've been better. I had really high expectations since my friend claimed this was the best ramen she has ever had. Overall, I wouldn't say it disappointed, since I did enjoy it, but it's certainly not the best. Even though, this is a must when it comes to the Boston ramen scene."
287,17,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"I got the shio ramen, which was super delicious. The chashu very tender, and the broth was rich and creamy. I got the small size and I finished it feeling just fine. Also recommend the pork cheeks if you want some extra protein."
288,18,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,4/5/2021,"My boyfriend and I stopped by this ramen spot while we were in Boston and it certainly did not disappoint!

This establishment is quite small with only 11 seats total- some at the bar and three tables. They do not take reservations, instead it is first come first serve. Luckily, when we got there, there was a short wait with only two parties ahead of us. While waiting you can scan the QR code to browse the menu. The prices are more than reasonable for the portion size of the ramen. My boyfriend and I both got the combo which was super worth it ($16. An extra $1 to size up) and it left us feeling more than satisfied. If you like a kick to your ramen the Kara Miso was delicious. The broth was rich and creamy and the add-ons from the combo completed each bite. 

Take note that there is only street parking available. There were many spots in front of the restaurant and on Newbury Street. 

This is a no-frills type of restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to satisfy their ramen craving!"
289,19,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,5/18/2021,"Certified addicting ramen spot! Willing to eat this anytime anywhere and it's sooo affordable. This place is a chain from Japan so you know it's legit! I always opt for the combo where you get ramen, a small side, and an ajitama (tea egg). I always choose the Karamiso because I love spicy ramen with the chashu gohan (pork belly on rice) as a side. 

My mouth is watering just writing the review! They have this location and a spot in Harvard sq which is larger and used the Yelp app for getting in line. Back Bay is old school - you have to actually wait in line so expect a wait especially during peak times! I've waited an hour before. 

With covid they've opened outside seating on the side of the road which has also been so nice!

The service is no fuss and very quick - such a great spot that you can't miss!

290,20,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,11/12/2021,"Decent priced, quickly served ramen. I'd opt for the larger portion for a few dollars more. This is one of those places that I don't mind stopping in between errands and grabbing lunch by myself."
291,21,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,2/26/2022,"+5 Great ramen at affordable pricing. 

-1 Con is that it is pretty crowded, you're literally sitting 3 inches away from ppl not in your party.

-1 Negative opinion is that it is very weird that utensils are on the table, cuz ppl could be spilling their noodles onto them, or spitting while talking. I feel they should bring out the chopsticks and spoon along with the food on the tray."
292,22,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,9/16/2021,"I finally stopped by this ever so busy Santouka earlier today and had a great bowl of kara miso ramen. I loved the option to get a small since I never finish a bowl of ramen, but it was a bit smaller than expected. Nevertheless, it's a fair price and the ramen was delicious. The broth was rich, noodles had a good chew, chasiu was tender, and egg was runny. It really hit the spot on the rainy day. If you are a spicy eater, they offer chili oil and flakes if requested. 

Great service, love the friendly staff."
293,23,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,4/23/2021,"Ate here for the first time recently. I got the curry ramen bowl combo ($17). I thought the fries in the curry bowl was a bit odd but it tasted very good. The soft boiled egg was a great included side. For my side of choice I picked the cha-su rice (white rice with pork and scallions). For a drink I just got water since their only options were bottled tea for $3 or sodas. 

Overall good experience. Service was friendly, my food tasted great, and I left full without breaking the bank (which is hard to do at a lot of restaurants in Back Bay). Would definitely come back. I wish they had more drink options though."
294,24,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,2/12/2022,I got the Shoyu Ramen and it was amazing! The broth tasted great and was delicious and you can tell that the ramen was freshly made too. I find that sometimes some places have more broth vs ramen but there was a good 1 to 1 ratio of noodles and broth! The restaurant is quite small so you might need to wait a bit and you'll need to share a table with other people. I would definitely come back again because it was delicious and the Shoyu Ramen I got was about 13 dollars!
295,25,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,9/1/2021,Came here for lunch around 1:30 pm and had a 20 minute wait for three people. It's a tiny place with a limited menu but everything was tasty. I tried the natto rice bowl and it was good-- the ratio of rice to soybeans was a bit off (huge portion of rice) and the ramen that was also ordered was great! The broth wasn't too salty (we asked for refused salt) and the pork was super fatty and good. Would definitely come back again!
296,26,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"I had heard from multiple Boston area natives that Santouka's ramen is the best in New England - I haven't been to other places, but the ramen here is certainly great compared to shops in NYC and San Francisco!

+ Delicious food: the eggs, salmon ikura bowls, and ramen here are delicious. With regards to the ramen - the broth is exceptional, toppings taste great, and noodles have perfect texture. The only area that could use improvement is the chashu - it could be softer and smokier - this was a 3/5 because the meat did taste a little tough.

+ Great value: Ramen is super cheap at ~$10 for a bowl, though they do not come with eggs ($2 extra per egg). The food also comes out mega fast.

+ Wonderful service: The female server here is phenomenal at her job - I've only been here 2-3 times and she remembered all my food allergies and is just extremely friendly and absolutely exceptional at her job. I love coming here in equal parts because of the food and to catch up with a friendly face.

+ Nice atmosphere: ambiance is cute inside and out - it's located on a beautiful block on Hereford Street between Comm Ave & Newbury - charming airs all around!"

Nonetheless, it's still good soup. 

It's very much like the one in California.  The wait wasn't too bad, probably about 30 minutes."

The broth was a bit saltier than I expected, but it's pretty typical of ramen broth to be salty in order to make the noodles flavorful. I also ordered an additional egg, but I was a little disappointed because the egg was not as runny :( however, the flavor of the ramen was amazing and it's definitely worth the visit!!"
301,31,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,8/17/2021,"Santouka is my long-time favorite ramen place. It's just SO. Good. I always get the karamiso ramen and it NEVER disappoints. The chashu is melt in your mouth, the noodles are done to perfection, and the broth is a perfect spicy. I especially like this location because it is so small and feels so personal and lively (at least, pre-covid smallness was a benefit to me!). Service is always friendly and I always leave my bowl clean."
302,32,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/19/2022,"BEST RAMEN I HAVE EVER HAD. 

The only thing that some may not like about Santouka is that you may have to share a table with strangers depending on how busy they are. It's a very small restaurant. Not a problem for me personally but it definitely could change some peoples minds. 

If you like ramen, you HAVE to go!"
303,33,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,11/12/2020,"With covid their capacity has shrunk even more than their previously small location provided them. They were able to get a few tables set up outside but with the cold weather I don't know how much longer they will be able to use those. Despite all this, I was seated relatively quickly, maybe in 10 minutes and the line I saw went by decently quick as well. 

The food came out very quick as well. This is only if my go to ramen places because it is so delicious. The broth isn't too salty and you get a very good proportion of noodles to toppings to broth. I got the Kara ramen I believe. I wish it was a little spicer but it was still overall great. This is one of my go to ramen spots for sure."
304,34,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,12/31/2021,"I had the ramen a while back when visiting Boston. Tbh, the ramen was not delicious and the soup is pretty bland even though I asked for saltier soup base. The restaurang is small and a bit clustered, but most ramen places are like that. Fast and friendly service is the only plus."
305,35,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,6/9/2021,"Came here on Monday evening! We arrived at around 6:30, and was seated immediately. About 30 minutes later, the whole restaurant was packed inside and out!

The menu was brief but that just hints how perfect each bowl of ramen must be! We ordered 2 Shio Ramen, which came out in a timely manner. I added an egg to mine as well! I love trying out ramen soups before digging into my meal and this soup was delicious! It was such a flavorful broth but its not thick at all! The pork was cooked perfectly, super soft and melty as well. Theres the perfect amount of noodles in each bowl as well! 

Overall, it's been so long since I've been to Santouka and i'm glad to say the quality is still there! Many restaurants weren't able to maintain their quality after the pandemic hit but Santouka definitely kept theirs!"
306,36,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,7/7/2021,Last time I been here was pre covid and they've expanded their seating to have outdoor seating also. We had a group of 4 and fit perfectly at one of their outdoor tables. Might be a little tough to sit outside if you have a larger group. The ramen was great at a good price too! The small size is just enough to fill me up without feeling too heavy afterwards. But if you want some extra broth and noodles the large size will satisfy you
307,37,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,11/4/2021,"A Boston comfort ramen joint with fresh well prepared ramen noodles, rice and char su. Tight packed spaces during COVID and TQ non-autonomous staff.  Not much spice, and no hot tea is easier to clean, but questionable authenticity.  I understand the business reasons but not the lack of spacing."
308,38,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,10/15/2021,"Solid ramen joint in back bay.  Highly recommend for the taste and quality.  Combo meal is a good deal and will leave you full. Natto tastes ok they could tell me it's not the frozen garbage most places serve and I would believe them (I didn't ask).  Pretty consistent in taste but the garnish can be off depending who is working. 

They are very quick as they should be since it's a ramen joint. Speed should be a given. I am typically in and out under 20 mins. 

Points off for small things like small size of the place. Seriously don't go with groups larger than two or you will wait. They have two large tables that can accommodate six or so people. That's it. 

The rookies won't notice but their shio ramen is actually tonkotsu ramen and not shio. Not many places can do shio so not shocked but don't order it thinking it's shio ramen."
309,39,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,10/29/2021,My favorite ramen spot!! The broth is very comforting -- very hot and flavorful! The ramen is al dente and pairs very well with the broth. The broth is pork I believe. So delicious! It is always consistent. Love their signature and spicy ramen here! Must try!
310,40,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"Place was fairly packed for Sunday lunch; get here early if you have a large group. Service was extremely quick considering the lunch rush.

We got the Cha Shu Ramen (Shio); 1 medium and 1 large. Honestly the medium is a filling portion because the broth will fill you up quick. For another $1 you can get the large if you want more noodles and broth. 

The Shio broth is really something - smooth, rich, and complex pork flavor. I'm convinced that Santouka has the best broth in town (or possibly in the state). Because the broth is made in-house and this place is a Japanese chain it's truly the real deal.

Go for the Cha Shu Ramen if you want more than 2 pieces of pork. The 5 pieces that they give you are sizeable and don't have too much fat so it's quite the steal."
311,41,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,10/16/2021,"Rating: 4.5 stars (rounded up)

The food is very good and SO reasonably priced. ~$11 for ramen is excellent, and the ramen is absolutely phenomenal- so flavorful, rich, and the meat so tender and delicious! Just FYI that just about everything including an egg costs extra ($2 for egg). The restaurant is truly tiny and as a result I wouldn't recommend coming here with a group- I came as part of a group of 4 and we unfortunately had to sit at the bar counter area :(. There are probably ~15 seats in the entire restaurant. For this reason, there is almost always a queue; we waited 45 minutes on Thursday 6pm. You will get rushed out when your party begins to finish eating as well, which is a little uncomfortable. Drink menu is limited, with no alcohol, though they do have Calpico! This overall is a good and authentic experience but best in certain settings- probably solo or as a couple, and would try for off peak times, and don't expect to be able to get a glass of wine with dinner :)."

313,43,Santouka Back Bay,2 star rating,8/30/2021,"We are not local but were craving for ramen during dinner time. Thought this location is convenient for us so we can visit other places in Boston. The line was so long b/c the seating was limited and we waited outside on a rainy day for almost 40 min-1 hr. After we finally went in, most of items on the menu weren't available. The only thing we could get was ramen and the waitress wasn't too helpful. I have to give credits for the soup and noodles, and it tasted rich and almost similar to any decent ramen that I had in NYC. However for chashu meat, they gave us pure fats lol and I didn't eat any of them. I think there are better ramen places...so don't be fooled by the waiting line..."
314,44,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,10/25/2020,"Ambiance: very small location with limited seating. Very clean space for covid regulations. Clean bathroom. 

Service: quick friendly service

Food: food is ok. This place didnt make my favorite list but the ramen isnt bad. Has spicy options, vegetarian option. The pork belly was good. 

Parking: meter parking. Back bay is typically hard to find parking so it is expected."
315,45,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,4/13/2021,"I'm so glad we came here before the lunch rush! We ordered the spicy miso ramen, shoyu ramen, chashu don, and ajitama. The ramen was very good with flavorful (but not too heavy) broth, freshly cooked noodles that were perfectly al dente, and very tender and flavorful pork belly. The chashu don was also very good and the ajitama tasted great when we topped our ramen with it. I definitely want to come back and try more of their ramen when I'm back in the area. I know understand why this place always has a line!"
316,46,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/10/2022,"Love the Santouka restaurants, huge fan of the Negi ramen as it's spicy enough and flavorful. Always ask for the double pork. Servers were quick, attentive, and friendly. The only possible downside I could think about was the size of the restaurant. If you go and it happens to be busy, especially in the winter, you could find yourself waiting outside for a good chunk of time. We luckily weren't one of those people, but we did watch some of them wait in the frigid winter. Either way, definitely worth the wait but bring some gloves!"
317,47,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,7/8/2020,"Wow, normally this place is packed and can never get a seat but we just happened to walk by and it was open. They were very safe about Covid-19 practices by making  us use hand sanitizers before we walked in. There were temporary walls between each seating area. 

The food is cheap for the city - got a combo with a small Shoyu ramen, with chasu shohan (fried rice and pork belly). I love that there was options for small bowl; most places have oversized overpriced bowls. The flavor was perfectly salty and the egg was perfectly cooked! Great service!"
318,48,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,3/14/2021,"This location may be small but they pack a punch of flavor in their ramen dishes! Definitely a fan favorite so expect a wait before you can try their delicious meal! The broth will satisfy your tastebuds and warm up your tummy on a cold winter day. I usually order the Shoyu Ramen with a side of corn and a soft boiled egg.

The staff here is very attentive and super friendly in their service. Always had a great experience whenever I stop by with friends."
319,49,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,6/15/2021,Delicious food and fast delivery. Great packaging that kept the soup and noodles fresh. Would definitely order from again and can't wait to visit in person.
320,50,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,6/16/2020,"I came here a handful of times pre-COVID and always left satisfied, although there was ALWAYS a line outside and it took a while to be seated. That just speaks to the popularity of this place and how good the food is. Also the interior is small so they can only seat so many people at a time.

I hadn't eaten here in a while, and I had a craving for it. They are open for take-out and delivery right now, so I decided to order my usual karamiso ramen. I ordered for pick-up on Grubhub at around 7pm and my food was ready 5 minutes later! No more long wait times, yay!!!

The to-go packaging is very well thought out. The noodles, meat, etc are all separated from the broth so it doesn't get soggy during transport, and the container is inside a plastic bag in case of spills. The container is big enough to use as a bowl; just add the ingredients into the broth and mix together to loosen up the noodles!

Pre-COVID, I would get the $15 combo, which allowed me to add corn and butter + ajitama to my karamiso ramen. I didn't see the option to make it a combo when ordering online so I guess they're not offering it currently. I had some corn and butter at home so I just made my own, but ajitama is a little more complicated to make. You can add it to your order but I wasn't willing to spend extra money on it.

Another thing I noticed was that the menu items got a little pricier. I'm not sure if this happened before COVID or during, but my ramen (not the $15 combo, just ramen alone!) cost $14.75 pre-tax. Before, a karamiso ramen alone was $11.75 pre-tax. I'm assuming the price increase is to account for the lack of tips since there's no dine-in allowed.

I wish the karamiso ramen came with more meat... like even 1 more slice would have been so much better. It only comes with 2 slices so my meat:noodle ratio is always off. But other than that, the flavor is so strong and so good. Even as a to-go order when it's not fresh out of the kitchen, it hits the spot. The karamiso broth isn't overly spicy in my opinion but has a nice kick to it. The noodles are chewy and delicious. The meat basically melts in your mouth.

Overall, I highly recommend this place, ESPECIALLY right now when the food is ready in less than 10 minutes. I'm sure once they're fully open for dine-in this will no longer happen, so take advantage of it while you can."
321,51,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,12/26/2020,"Very solid and reliable ramen in Boston. The location has very limited seating. If you have 4 or more, I'd suggest going early or go to their sister location in Cambridge. The back bay location had only 3 tables who sat 2 each and a bar top which sat about 6 max.

Service was good. Food was excellent. I'd recommend getting the combo deals. Starts at $15 and you get a bowl of ramen, a side dish, and an egg! This time I got the spicy miso, which is a good mild spice, with chashu gohan side, and the egg. I only got the chashu gohan because you get extra bits of chashu that I can eat with my ramen. My fiancee got the regular ramen with 2 eggs! By the time we finished, a line outside the restaurant was forming. Overall very delicious ramen at an even more delicious price!"
322,52,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,6/24/2021,Small and well-staffed. Menu is available by scan and strangers may be seated next to you at the same table. The food was really good and service was efficient. Get there early because they don't take reservations.
323,53,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,3/31/2021,"This is hands down probably one of the best ramen places I've had in my life. Been here multiple times (including the one in Harvard) and I've always just been blown away. Only downside is that there is ALWAYS a wait, especially in the back bay location and they require you to line up. Atleast the Harvard spot lets you leave a phone number. 

Regardless, the quality of the ramen is absolutely superb. The noodles are cooked to perfection and it carries the flavor of the broth extremely well. The broth itself isn't overly heavy or salty. It's perfectly balanced, as all things should be. The charsu is soft and savory, the Bamboo is crunchy yet not tough, the ear fungus give diversity to texture.

Also get the charshu rice. It's very simple but pair it with the sauces and it's an absolute pleasure. 

I can't compliment this place enough, I really really love it. Service is also always great!!"
324,54,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,12/19/2021,"there's a reason why this place always has such long lines no matter how hot or cold it is outside. partially it's because the inside of the restaurant can probably only fit 20 customers at once, but it's also because the ramen is amazing!
-they don't accept reservations. the lines are really long during lunch/dinner hours; we had to wait around 45 minutes for a table of 4. however, the service is really quick. because they have so many customers, the food is made very quickly; we only had to wait less than 10 minutes for our food after ordering. although, you're kind of pressured to leave the restaurant once you finish your food. we didn't mind though, because they have to move the line along one way or another. 
-i don't remember if they accept both cash and card, but i believe we paid for our food with cash.
-if you want to order takeout/pickup, you can do so through their website.

-tonkotsu shio ramen: this is one of their most popular bowls; it has a silky tonkotsu broth enhanced with a simple salt flavor. the default toppings are pork chasu, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushrooms, scallions, and a small piece of narutomaki. if you want any additional toppings, like more pork or an egg, it'll cost extra. however, i just went with the standard option. you can get the bowl in small, medium, or large sizes, which are all different prices. i decided to get the medium bowl, which costs $12.57 including tax. although the bowl looks initially kind of small, it's actually quite filling, the toppings tasted great together, and the pork was tender and cooked just the right amount the broth was rich and super flavorful, and the ramen noodles soaked up the broth really well. it also wasn't too salty, but it did make me feel quite thirsty after eating. otherwise, i really couldn't find anything that i disliked about this bowl, and it was reasonably priced too! (4.5/5)

overall, the ramen is seriously is great. it's not anything super special or on the same level as ramen from japan, but it's one of the best options in boston. not to mention, the affordability makes the meal even more worth it. while i can't imagine myself coming back anytime soon since their lines are so long, i really did enjoy my experience here. i'd highly recommend that you must try their tonkotsu shio ramen!"

329,59,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,5/3/2021,"I always wanted to try this location for long time and finally after getting Covid Vaccine Me and my wife had extra time to have ramen brunch there.
We ordered Mazemen, Kara Rammen, and Natto Gohan.
Maybe we had too much expectation but all of them were just average, or less. Mazemen was super salty and the noodles were little uncooked. Kara Ramen was the best among three dishes we had but it was too salty as well. Natto Gohan (Rice with fermented beans) is nothing write home about. It was just white rice with natto with just some scallion."
330,60,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,2/21/2022,"This is one of my favorite ramen places in Boston. Although there is often a line and a wait, it is well worth it. There are three different sizes you can get, however, the regular was plenty in my opinion. The Kara Miso Ramen is definitely my favorite. The broth is perfect and did not taste too salty. I love the marinated egg that you can add! Sometimes when it is very busy, you might have to share a table with another party but I truly believe this is all part of the experience and I love that! The restaurant is small but quality over quantity is important. Their ramen is PERFECT for a cold day but also very satisfying for a warmer day too."
331,61,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,7/19/2021,"My girlfriend and I went for lunch on a Monday and were luckily able to sit down immediately (this place is normally packed with a line stretching down the block). They have ~5 tables outside on the street and more seating inside. We elected to sit outside. I think they also do a lot of takeout business.  

I got the Kara Miso Ramen, which was fantastic. I believe this was the second spiciest option on the menu, behind the Negi Namben Ramen. Also very good from a price standpoint compared to other restaurants in Boston and Back Bay in particular. 

Only wrinkle was that their credit card system was down when we went. We had cash so wasn't a problem but otherwise they were writing down credit card numbers. 

Overall, would highly recommend."
332,62,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,2/4/2021,"I got the Vegetarian ramen and it jus didn't have any depth of flavor. You may ask why get a vegetarian ramen at a ramen shop? I ask why have it on the menu if it's going to lack any flavor? Thankfully I had asked for chili oil and that added some flavor to it. 

The noodles were also mediocre. Nothing special. 

My packet of nongshim shin ramen black has more flavor in it for 1/6 of the price"
333,63,Santouka Back Bay,2 star rating,2/6/2021,"Santouka Back Bay attracts massive lines and widespread adulation for their flavorful ramen bowls, but they definitely have less to offer for plant-based visitors. Their vegetarian ramen was bland, salty, and oily, leaving much to be desired. I hoped for more tofu, vegetables, and real flavor, but the experience really disappointed. Overall, Santouka wins points for their small-shop ambiance, great location, and passion for the perfection of a precise craft, but Red White (nearby on Newbury) will provide a much tastier experience for vegetarian ramen enthusiasts."

337,67,Santouka Back Bay,1 star rating,12/27/2020,"Christmas letdown

It was a rainy Christmas Day this year. It was 2:25pm and had been raining all day on the 25th. It was hard deciding what to eat with most restaurants closing for Christmas Day. Luckily I find Santouka back bay open. Without hesitation, I called at 2:30pm to make sure I wasn't dreaming. 

""Hey are you guys really open today?"" 

The host curtly answers, ""yes.""

""I know there is usually a line out the door. Is that the case today? What's the volume like?""

The host answers, ""no, when are you coming? And for how many?"" 

""I roughly estimate 15 minutes for two?""

The host answers, ""should be fine"" 

""Perfect. We will be there soon. Thanks"" 

As soon as I hang up, my girlfriend and I grab our umbrellas and immediately start walking over at 2:30pm. She mentions that she saw a closing time of 3pm online today, so we acknowledge it and briskly start walking to the restaurant. Because of the rain, wind and puddles, it was a long 15 minutes, and we ended up at the front of the restaurant at 2:52pm. 22 minutes. 

The host sees us struggling to open the door against the wind and just watches us. As soon as we open the door, he quietly points towards the sign saying they are closed at 3pm today. Cool. So we're just in time! 

NOPE. Last call was 2:45pm and we won't be seated. I tried appealing to him that it's Christmas Day, we walked in the rain for over 15 minutes to get here, there's a table clearly empty for us, no one else is outside except us so its not a big deal to make a one time exception. Nope. He did not give a damn. He could've told us, if we called at 2:30pm saying we'll be there by 2:45pm, that they are taking last call at 2:45. 

It is what it is. He probably wants to get off work on Christmas Day as early as possible. It was disappointing that he wouldn't mention last call or closing up shop when it was THAT close to the deadline. 

To my dear readers who may think this review comes off harsh, please think back on any time that you asked for operating hours of a restaurant over the phone: was it not customary for the host to tell you the last call for kitchen/bar should it differ from a published closing time? If I called the restaurant at 2:30 with an eta of 15 mins, should that not have warranted some kind of disclosure from the host's part? The behavior of that host was frustrating and, frankly, negligent.

I am leaving a one star review not because of this one incident but after numerous instances where the same host has manifested zero hospitality. I honestly love the food so I keep going back but the host leaves too much to be desired for a higher review."

The restaurant is very small. Probably seats max 20 people. 

We ordered the Combo Shoyu Ramen with variations of added ingredients (such as egg, corn or pork with rice in side). 

Shortly later, our ramen came piping hot and steaming to our table. The broth and noodles were rich and tasty and there was a good amount of pork included. 

We were looking for a good place in Boston for our Ramen fix and found one!

My partner and I are both international and our first language is not English, therefore, sometimes it's hard to understand English from hearing. My partner was asking a host for a seat outside because inside they are really shoddy on following the regulations. The host said something and my partner couldn't hear it properly because of the language barrier, the host had an audacity to roll his eyes, point to the table and slap the glasses of water on a shaky table after.
I am not coming back, ever."
342,72,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,1/4/2021,"Very small eatery, good food and service. I will order online via their original website and pick up next time to avoid queuing up"
343,73,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,8/19/2019,"I heard this was the place to go in Boston--had to check it out. I got the $15 combo with kara miso. 

BROTH: So flavorful but not too rich. I personally prefer a slightly richer broth, but the flavors here are impeccable. The spicy miso broth wasn't spicy for someone like me who has a higher tolerance, but it packs a nice kick that still makes the broth enjoyable to consume. In comparison, the stranger who sat next to me was coughing in response to the spicy broth. So maybe not the choice for those with a low tolerance. 

NOODLES: I'm a fan of al dente noodles. These still held a slightly chewy texture, but were a touch on the softer side. The portion isn't too heavy either for the regular size. You leave feeling satisfied, not too full. 

LINE: I got there around 1:15pm on a Sunday and waited around 20-25 minutes for one seat. Not bad at all, but I don't think I'd ever find myself waiting for an hour here like I would elsewhere.  

SERVICE: I was in and out faster than my wait time for a seat. To maximize efficiency/turnover rates, you're seated across/next to people in other parties. The fewer people in your party, the easier is will be to seat you at these communal tables. Because I was a party of one, it made sense that I sat down, ordered, and was served all under 10 minutes. Staff was efficient, good at scanning tables, but all in the name of quick turnover. If you're looking for a calm sit down meal where you don't feel pressured to eat fast, this place isn't it. Take your conversation elsewhere. 

Overall, I've had better ramen. But this place puts up a good fight. I'd consider coming back if I'm in the area, but only if the line isn't too long."
344,74,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,12/3/2019,"Yu um!!! We went here on a Wednesday evening at 5pm and waited about 10-15ish minutes. Not bad! Way less than I expected. 

Their service is speedy! which makes sense since they always have a huge line outside their door. We received our food shortly after we ordered. I got the kara miso ramen combo with corn. DELICIOUS! The perfect amount of spice and food. The noodles and broth were perfect and the corn was so good. I love the butter that they pair with it. 

It's definitely worth the wait and it's quite inexpensive!"
345,75,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,12/1/2019,"Solid ramen shop in the city. Having read the reviews and it being Thanksgiving weekend, our table of 3 arrived a few minutes after opening on a Sunday and was second in line. Our total wait time was 30min however due to the venue only seating ~18. 

Food: The regular size filled me up. If you're hungry, I'd recommend a large. The price was on par with the bowl size. We got miso and shoyu ramen. Both very rich in flavor. Noods good. Pork belly was so-so. 

Service: Quick. We were able to order in line and have our ramen ready when we got seated! 

I wouldn't say it was worth the wait in the WINTER bc we were freezing in the cold. So just get to the restaurant a little before it opens!"
346,76,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,12/19/2020,"My go-to place for ramen! Perfect for a cold winter day. I was seated at the bar and they had plastic dividers for COVID (reminded me a bit of eating ramen in single booths in Japan). The $15 combo is a steal -- I love their chashu gohan, and ajitama is a must. I got the karamiso ramen this time and it was only mildly spicy, which was perfect for me. The service was nice as well, and overall it was a great experience!"
347,77,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,5/16/2020,"After 3 years of living in Back Bay and having Santouka always be my go-to hang-over cure. I've decided its time to give them a solid review, after all the unknowing times they were there for me.

True to their motto, their ramen soup really does provide: the essence of simplicity and deep umami flavors.

I always order:
-the signature tonkotsu shio ramen
-cha-shu gohan rice bowl

The cha-shu rice is bomb! Japanese rice with perfectly salted cha-shu chunks. The cha-shu is fresh and not fatty/greasy. The green onions make for the perfect compliment. Who knew such a simple dish could be so satisfyingly good?!

I one time ordered to-go and my initial thought was *wow, impressive, well-thought of to-go packing for ramen. Usually, Asian to-go order noodle soups come with noodles and soup in 2 separate styrofoam containers. Santouka has their noodles and toppings placed neatly divided & stacked on top of the soup! Just, a detail appreciation! As far as flavor goes, the soup has so much depth. I could drink it all the time. The noodles are a bit hard and could use some work. The cost is also moderately overpriced for the portion, but I get it Back Bay rent ain't cheap!"
348,78,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,4/27/2021,"Best ramen I've had in a long time. Service was excellent too. 

Loved it here and will be back."
349,79,Santouka Back Bay,2 star rating,7/16/2021,"It seems like their karamiso does not contain Tonkotsu soup, and is not specified by any description. I tried their gomamiso soup which does coagulate after refrigerated. So their Tonkotsu soup is not fake."
350,80,Santouka Back Bay,1 star rating,10/2/2021,"Rude wait staff. I asked if I could sit outside, when there were 4-5 empty tables, and the response was ""no.""

Then he told me to stand in the line (there was no one in line).

Also the space is extremely small with everyone basically sitting elbow to elbow with no ventilation. Your stereotypical COVID trap.

Why anyone would want to pay money to this place and get treated like trash + contract COVID is beyond me."
351,81,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,8/21/2021,"Delicious broth and cozy vibes. I once waited in pouring rain with friends thinking it wouldn't be as busy, but others must have been thinking the same and there was still a decent line outside the door. Worth tho"
352,82,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,4/15/2019,"Now listen, no one wants to wait in line to eat but at the same time, when you see a line for a restaurant you know it's probably worth the wait. Needless to say, if you decide to visit this location you will definitely be waiting in line to get your bowl of ramen. The restaurant itself is pretty small so be prepared to eat your dinner in a very close proximity to strangers. 

As a ramen connoisseur I can tell you that this ramen was definitely worth the wait. I ordered the miso ramen combo which was $15 and came with a side of corn and butter and a tea egg. The noodles were thinner than some of the other ramen places I have been to, but they tasted fresh and firm,but not too firm . The tea egg was also just the right amount of soft and complimented the rest of the dish. 

Overall you will leave with a full belly and a happy heart. It's definitely worth the wait."
353,83,Santouka Back Bay,3 star rating,3/29/2019,"I think I'm a little spoiled coming from the SF Bay Area where ramen is abundant and amazing. This is the first ramen place in Boston I've had and it just didn't impress me. 

The price is a little high. It's a filling size, but don't expect to have leftovers if you get the regular size. 

I ordered the Char Siu Ramen with Miso broth, which gives a substantial amount of pork. The noodles have a nice chew to them, but the broth was too thick and salty. It's just not really drinkable which is unfortunate. 

There's not much seating inside, so if you don't come before 5, expect to wait a little while (we waited ~15 minutes). Overall, I won't be coming back unless a friend wants to try."
354,84,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,3/27/2019,"You know you're in for a treat if there's a line outside . . . IN FEBRUARY, IN BOSTON. I'll be honest - I hesitated waiting in line. It was so cold and I'm from Miami which means I don't have thick skin or any cold tolerance whatsoever.

The result - it was so good! I'm glad we waited. I'm sure the line would have been much worse had we gotten there earlier. I believe most of the broths are tonkotsu-based but there is a veggie option. I chose the Negi Namban Ramen with a side of an egg and corn. So much flavor and on such a cold evening, my belly was so happy. There were a lot more onions that I anticipated but that's on me for not fully reading the menu.

The restaurant is very small. It only fits about 18 people but the food comes out fairly quick so the tables turn quick. Do not expect to ""eat alone"". You will be sat next to your fellow diners but don't fret, make friends! You're all there to enjoy a nice, warm bowl of soup! I can't wait to go back . . . not in the winter, lol."
355,85,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,6/2/2019,"One of my favorite ramen shops in Boston!

This place is tiny though - ended up waiting over 45 minutes to be seated for a party of two. However, I think that it is well worth the wait to try for the first time. Their shio ramen is here is just so good - the broth is quite pork-y and has a great consistency and the pork here is the perfect mix of fatty and lean. Super tender. I highly recommend!"
356,86,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,1/19/2020,"RAMEN SOLO

I feel like a ramen Jedi because I used the force in my favor. This place is packed. I walked by on a Friday night and there were 40 people in line. I checked out the menu and I knew I had to eat here. It was now Saturday night and again there were 40 people in line at 6:30pm. It didn't help that it was January and it was a high of 68, in fact it probably made the line even longer. 

The best part of traveling for work is dining solo and sometimes it has its advantages. While I was in the back of the line the server was looking for just one person and I was the lucky solo that literally got to skip the line. Honestly I was only in line for about 5 minutes. This was my lucky day to Ramen. 

The menu is not very friendly on line and it's inconsistent because there locations can have different items. They have a great $15 deal where you pick 3 items. I decided to go for it. I wanted to go spicy and decided to order the spicy miso ramen, Cha-Shu Gohan which is Pork and Rice and Aji Tama which is a soft boiled egg marinated in soy-based sauce. The egg was cooked perfectly. The broth for the ramen was crazy good. The menu says the broth takes 18 hours to make from beef bones. The Cha-Shu Gohan was really good. I added spicy broth to it and took it back to my hotel for breakfast. I'm a lucky man. 

The restaurant is tiny. It literally has 18 seats located at 2 tables and 1 bar that faces the kitchen. I was seated at a table of complete strangers. I honestly felt like I was traveling around the world by sharing a community table. Those people finished and I was introduced to a whole new group that joined me. Yes a party of 5 joined me at my table. As I enjoyed my ramen I listened to the girl next to me talk about her upcoming wedding. She shared the planing, the church, the dress and much more. I wanted to jump in but kept focusing on my ramen. The cutest part was when I went to leave she told me to have a nice night. That was really sweet considering we ate dinner together but never had a conversation with each other. I felt a little bad but it's best I kept quite because they would have never got me to stop talking. 

It is worth the wait. They really serve fast and keep the line moving. My waiter was really nice. I've read review that the servers are mean. I have to disagree with this. Hey have a job to do and that is to move people in and out. There was a group of four that had paid their bill and were still hanging out. The waiter politely asked them to leave. He did it in a nice manner but I'm sure someone in the group will write a bad review because the lu felt rushed. I could see that my waiter hates having to do this but it's the only way he can get diners in. My advice is to know what you want, eat your food, pay your bill and get out. It's your duty to help your fellow ramen lover waiting in line. I was lucky enough to have to force in my side and I hope you have the same luck that I did when you dine"
357,87,Santouka Back Bay,5 star rating,6/26/2019,"TLDR: small space, great ramen. 

Always a line the inside fits around 25 at most. Don't come here if you've got a group bigger than 4.  Anyways, ramen is super solid. It's a tonkotsu broth so pork based. They do have a veggie broth as well as long as supplies last. Broth is great, the chashu wonderful and all around a great bowl of ramen. Be prepared to wait 15 minutes when you get here, but it's definitely good."
358,88,Santouka Back Bay,1 star rating,12/11/2021,"Gave a ten percent tip and the busk boy asked to fight and cursed me out. He then proceeded to tell the waiter who helped me that I didn't pay even though he swiped my card, when I started to say if he needed the money I can put down more and then proceeded to say he didn't want my money and he never wanted me back inside of the restaurant."
359,89,Santouka Back Bay,4 star rating,6/11/2019,"I had no idea that a Santouka opened up here! I haven't walked past this street in what it seems to be a VERY long time to notice that it's no longer an Indian Cuisine place.

I was starving and was actually on the hunt for some soup and when I spotted here I came in. It's very small inside so minimal seating. But I came outside of peak hours so it was pretty empty. They have all the ramen bowls as the one in Harvard but not as many side items. 

Items NOT on the menu here that I noticed:
- takoyaki
- Karaage
- Gyoza
- Green Salad
- Shiyake Ikura Gohan

I was served very quickly. The staff is very attentive. I took up the menu from the chair next to me while I had my Cha-Shu Ramen to see if there was anything I could order for my husband to take out (which by the way the do not do) and the waiter was attentive to ask if I was ok and needed anything else."
360,0,Krasi,5 star rating,3/28/2022,"I had an incredible experience at Krasi and think that this may be my new favorite restaurant in Boston. Everything was perfect.

FOOD
Each dish was perfect. My friend and I shared the following:
* Taramosalata
* Pantzaria 
* Pita - changes daily; was amazing
* Giouvetsi - this lamb osso buco + orzo combo was amazing
* Halva ice cream + chocolate cake - so good

DRANK
Greek white wines are delicious! I had a glass of Malagousia. It was fruity and went well with all the food. They also have the Xynisteri from Tsiakkas, which I've tried before and love - I highly recommend that, too!

VIBE
The vibe is chic, intimate, clean, and modern. Located right off of Newbury street, which is also great to explore. 

SERVICE
The service was outstanding! Everyone was so nice, helpful, and extremely quick. 

MONEY THO
Not bad at all! My friend and I had 5 dishes + 1 glass of wine each, and we paid less than $70/person. Great value."
361,1,Krasi,4 star rating,4/11/2022,"I came here for brunch on a Saturday with my friend. We originally got bar seating, but the hostess was able to get us a seat at the table which was much appreciated! The ambience of this place was very elegant with the thoughtfully selected Greek-inspired decor. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great suggestions. We ordered 3 dishes, which were just the right amount for the 2 of us, and they came fairly quickly after we ordered. Here's what we got, ranked from favorite to least favorite:

Solomo ($16)
The smoked salmon was delicious and paired well with all the other ingredients. It was well balanced with the acidity from the caper berries to the richness of the boiled egg and cream cheese.

Souvla
Delicious cuts of lamb that was extremely tender and flavorful. The char on the outside gave each piece a nice smoky flavor.

Pita with Fried Egg ($12 + $2 for egg)
The pie was good, but it wasn't as flavorful as the other dishes.

Besides the food, we also got 2 drinks: Aphrodite's Bellini ($12) and Greek Negroni ($16). They were both tasty. I recommend the Bellini if you prefer a sweeter drink."
362,2,Krasi,5 star rating,3/26/2022,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday with my fiancé. Place was really nice and tables felt roomy when sitting down. The waiter was super nice and gave us a ton of suggestions, most of which we ended up taking. The best part was the food. 

First thing we had were the Dips. Bread was top notch, and the spicy feta was unique. Next we were brought the Solomo. The lox was delicious, definitely recommend. We also had the Pita and the Avga Me Patates. My favorite out of everything though was the Orange Cake. Please don't skimp out on the Orange Cake, trust me it's worth coming here just for that."
363,3,Krasi,5 star rating,4/9/2022,"The atmosphere of this place is so cute. Very good for weekend brunch. The coffee was good, nothing special. You must get the tsoureki. It was almost like a breakfast apple pie with this delicious granola and a very mild chocolate sauce. Incredible. 2nd favorite dish was the avga me patates. We got without goat cheese but it was really good. The  bougatsa was good but nothing special. The pancakes had an interesting filling I wasn't a fan of personally. It was a crumbly whey like texture. Service was excellent! Food came super fast."
364,4,Krasi,5 star rating,1/9/2022,"We came here as a last night of vacation dinner and I'm still thinking about it. I haven't been able to find a Greek restaurant like this anywhere near me and it's so upsetting. This was such a great restaurant to have ended our time in Boston!
We ended up getting a few different things to share and every bit was so delicious so I can only imagine how great the whole menu is. We also got some wonderful greek wines that we plan to purchase to have at home. 
I really loved the vibes of this restaurant and how trendy, but cozy it was inside. I also loved how the menu was traditional Greek foods. It really felt like we were getting what we would find in Greece. The employees were all so knowledgeable about the menu and we had great service. 
I recommend this place to anyone I know visiting Boston and we would definitely come back!"
365,5,Krasi,5 star rating,1/1/2022,"My friend and I came here for dinner and the food was PHENOMENAL. I would say it was in the top five best meals either of us have ever had. 

We started with the Tiropita Rolls and the Htipiti dip. The bread itself was probably the best bread I've ever had. It was perfectly warm, moist, and delicious. I could've eaten the rolls all night. The whipped feta had so much flavor and had a little kick to it. It paired so well with the veggies we ordered on the side. 

Our favorite thing we ordered was the Papoutsakia - it was so flavorful and creamy. We also got the Patates and Pantzaria. 

Our server was incredible - we unfortunately didn't catch her name, but she was so helpful in guiding us through the menu and the wine list. She gave us a little wine tasting based on a little information on which wines we prefer, and picked the most delicious wines for both of us. Overall, incredible service and incredible food. We cant wait to come back here!"
366,6,Krasi,5 star rating,1/6/2022,"I had a great experience dining here at Krasi! We were seated quickly, the service was attentive without being overbearing, and the food was unique and tasty.

We ordered 4 dishes to share between 2 people, which was more than enough food! My favorite item by far was the Taramosalata dip. The tarama was light, creamy, and flavorful. The monkfish was also delicious.

They also have an extensive wine list that was a bit too long for me to make a decision on my own. Our server was very helpful with this! After asking for our wine preferences, she brought over two wines for us to taste before we made our selection. Any restaurant that provides a tasting before making a selection on beer/wine is highly ranked in my book!

I was able to book a table for a late (8:45pm) dinner 1 week in advance, so I would definitely look into reservations earlier if you have a bigger group or want a specific dining time. 

Overall, this is a great spot for a dinner date or simply a delicious meal with friends and family."
367,7,Krasi,5 star rating,11/26/2021,"Just about everything was delicious. Came for dinner and brunch in the same weekend. Perhaps it was because it was our first time there, but I think the brunch is better than the dinner. The dips were all great, the bread was phenomenal, the salad was incredibly tasty with so many flavors. 

For the brunch the shredded potato dish was my favorite. I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese normally, but it definitely complimented the dish, adding a bit of tartness to every bite.

For dinner, the lamb osso buco was very good, but not great. The meat itself could have been a bit more tender in my opinion. The orzo tasted tomatoey. It was all very filling. The octopus dish was confusing and unexpected. There was no indication on the menu that the octopus was ground up, so it was hard to tell there was even octopus in the dish."
368,8,Krasi,4 star rating,12/9/2021,"My friends and I came here for brunch on a Sunday and sat inside. The ambiance when you first enter is amazing! The bar is really lavish and the decor feels really luxurious. We had a reservation-- I'm not sure why Yelp says no reservations but they do take them! 

We saw that they had carafes of wine for $20, so naturally we had to get that. We went with white and it was more than enough for our table! 

For dishes we ordered Lalagites, Solomo, Avga me Patates, and the Pita. The dishes were smaller than we imagined unfortunately but each one tasted really good! Other than the Solomo, the dishes were a little hard to share. We ordered with the intention of sharing each dish, but I think everyone having their own plate would work better. 

Bonus point for having Aesop hand soap and hand cream in the bathrooms!!"
369,9,Krasi,5 star rating,11/9/2021,"Came here a few weeks ago with my husband!

Just wow. We had reserved two seats at the bar which was fun because we got to talk to our bartender/server more. The ambiance is that of a lovely, upscale wine bar and it was bustling on a Friday night.

Some must haves :

The  tiropita rolls are delectable, warm, soft, fresh, and amazing! Don't come here and pass on these, trust me. 

We also really enjoyed the htipiti which is their whipped feta dip. It has a kick and is super flavorful. We ate the dip mostly with the chicken skins which was a fun twist, but we also enjoyed the dip with some side bread. Would absolutely get this again as well.

We enjoyed the Tonos sashimi for dinner which was a plentiful portion of Mediterranean inspired sashimi. It was light, fresh, and prepared well. 

We did the short rib after which was definitely heavier and meaty-at that point we were rather full and could only have half. It was served almost like a meat lasagna which I don't think we were expecting. It was flavorful, just a little heavier than I think we were aiming for.

Nonetheless, it was all amazing and enjoyed with a wonderful bottle of wine. Our server truly was passionate about the menu and answered all of our questions eagerly. Overall, an amazing night out for date night. 

I definitely want to return for brunch and try the lamb entree based on reviews!"
370,10,Krasi,5 star rating,3/1/2022,"One of my all-time favorite restaurants in Boston! I went here during the summer with my friend. It was such an amazing dining experience. So I went back the second time with my boyfriend this Valentine's weekend and he also fell in love! 

We got their Solomo, Dips, Lalagites, Strapasada, and their Agva Me Patates. The Patates are perhaps their most famous brunch dish, but everything was exceptionally tasty. Our surprise favorite was actually the dips, specifically the rich and creamy taramasalata (salted cod roe). If we could order the taramasalata dip in a bucket we would!

The atmosphere is amazing. The cocktails are great! Definitely check it out!!"
371,11,Krasi,5 star rating,11/13/2021,"So we're standing in line for lobster rolls in ME and the couple ahead of us is from Boston and highly recommended this place. They looked like they took food seriously so we decided to give it a try. Wow, did not disappoint. We did make reservations and I would recommend it because this place looks to get pretty busy. We sat at the bar and it was perfect.

We tried the fried chicken skins with whipped feta dip. Thought it would be salty but it wasn't, the skin had a great crisp and honestly, I prob could eat this every day. We also got the grilled octopus which was super tender and beets that were delicious. Their rolls were delicious with a honey butter. What can I say when pillowy yeasty bread melts in your mouth? Besides can I have two more! We also got their grilled special of the day which was pork tenderloin. Usually I don't get tenderloin in restaurants because it's tender but lacks in flavor. Not this one, it's well seasoned and the grilling flavor comes out. The orange honey cake and ice cream was ok, might have been to satiated by the meal to fully enjoy. 

The service was awesome, our server was knowledgeable and steered us well. I would come back here in a heartbeat and try the other offerings. Or get all the same dishes again!"
372,12,Krasi,5 star rating,1/26/2022,"Krasi serves delicious small plates and an unique selection of Greek wines! The portions are on the bigger end for small plates, so I'd recommend going with at least 3-4 people to be able to order some more dishes across the menu! Of our meal, I enjoyed the ""Little Shoes"" eggplant and the Lamb osso bucco which had an amazingly fragrant orzo paired with it."
373,13,Krasi,1 star rating,2/20/2022,"The place is super nice and pretty but the food, I would, say was SO MEDIOCRE and it literally does not worth the price.

I ordered the pita and it tasted like the dough was raw and there was way too much cheese in it. I took two bites and brought the rest home.

The scrambled egg with tomato sauce was also super mediocre. It is just plain eggs plus tomato plus cheese and I left half of the plate over.

Went with great expectation but probably no second visit. Service was just okay. Manager guy is nice."
374,14,Krasi,5 star rating,10/17/2021,"Krasi is an excellent restaurant that serves modern takes on classic Greek cuisine. I've been for dinner and brunch and neither disappointed, but their brunch is seriously out of this world. 

I most recently went for brunch so that's what I'll be reviewing / posting. Their bougatsa was pretty good (I'm Greek and from Thessaloniki so I'm very hard to please in this department) - not too sweet but filo could be crispier. Their saganaki was insane with a jammy egg on top and a bit of spicy pepper it was probably my favourite dish. We also had the strata - an egg type pie like a quiche with loukaniko stuffed inside. Their pita was also excellent, with vegetables and cheese this was also a favourite for me. The avga me patates were a different style than I'm used to but still good with bacon served underneath. I got the Aphrodite's Bellini to drink and it was delicious. 

Overall excellent experience - I definitely recommend. Probably best brunch I've had in a long while that wasn't just over priced eggs on toast.

375,15,Krasi,4 star rating,10/23/2021,"Had an excellent brunch at Krasi this morning! We originally had an outdoor reservation but it was rather cold and breezy so I reached out to switch it to indoors. They are a text only restaurant, so I was first referred to their AI messaging but when my specific question couldn't be answered, a manager texted me back. They amazingly were able to switch my reservation to inside on short notice which I really appreciated. 

We ordered several mezze dishes, most of which were amazing. The dips platter was super tasty although the ratio of dips to bread pieces felt a little off - other reviewers have mentioned you could ask for more bread but that felt tough on a busy morning. Their pita pie and peirili were really well made - I would order them again. The baklava muffin sounded good but in practice was a little dry/tough - I don't think I would get it again but it was a small sweet bite to end the meal. The coffee was truly excellent and they refilled it which I appreciated. 

All in all I would return here for brunch, and was impressed by the flexibility of reservations."
376,16,Krasi,5 star rating,8/16/2021,"We visited Krasi with my friend who is extremely into their food and has tried every dish on the menu. She said that Krasi is one of her favorite places for dining out. 

The options are limited on their brunch menu and we had 4 dishes to share with a group of three: Souvla, Bougatsa for 2, Pita and Lalagites. The food was great with appealing presentation especially the Lalagites which was fried pancakes, fluffy and soft inside with crispy layer. 

We also got 2 drinks, Krasi Mimosa which was specially made with Mango base and Otto Sprizitz. Both were refreshing and went perfectly with the food. 

My friend strongly recommend us to visit again for their dinner menu so we will definitely plan it when we visit Boston next time."
377,17,Krasi,5 star rating,8/13/2021,"Another great tapas-style spot in Boston you can't miss. Greek food, delicious wine, what's not to like!
We ordered the Salata, the daily Pita (which was stuffed with spinach and cheese), and the Skioufikta (a gnocchi-type pasta). Not only was everything delicious, where you could taste the quality of the ingredients, but also presented beautifully. We ended the night by ordering all three desserts, because we simply couldn't choose. we got the almond cookies, which came with tahini and chocolate dips, as well as some homemade orange marmalade they went so well with, and an orange-honey cake, and the chocolate salami. I've had chocolate salami from other cuisines, such as italian and portuguese, and it was very fun to taste this version, with hazelnuts in it. The last two desserts both came with ice cream which was a very good pairing."
378,18,Krasi,5 star rating,1/14/2022,"I came to Krasi on a whim when looking for a new restaurant to try. It was great to snag a seat at the bar at Krasi, where the menu, artwork, and vibes are decidedly and unapologetically Greek.

Jimmy was a super friendly bartender and offered recommendations. He guided me toward my entree (more on that later) and I asked for a pairing recommendation. He pointed me to one bold wine that I tasted, although I wasn't in love with it and so I tried a second. While it was lighter and a little out of the way of my typically favorite grapes, that's part of the fun. It was the Plakota from Cyprus. The wine menu is intentionally 100% Greek, and I've had fun at a few Greek restaurants learning about Greek wines. 

The tables were pretty busy on this particular Saturday night, although the bar area cleared out quickly. It smells faintly of good olive oil in the restaurant, which I take as a great sign. 

Mastija apertif was super interesting! You really have to try it, as a text description doesn't begin to capture the melange of flavors...but I'll try: Meyer lemon, freshly cut grass (in a good way), and a ton of herbs packed into a little glass!

I had the pastitsio rollo, which is made with egg pasta, braised short rib, and among other things, cinnamon. My interest was piqued by the cinnamon, but I have to say, the cinnamon was perfectly noticeable but NOT overpowering. It was really an amazing balance that I am impressed they pulled off so nicely. I followed this up with a dessert wine, courtesy of Jimmy's recommendations.

All in all, this was great! All the servers seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs and each other's company, and everyone who worked there seemed to radiate friendliness. That sounds extra, but it was true. I'm super excited to come back and get some more of Jimmy's recommendations!"
379,19,Krasi,5 star rating,2/7/2022,"Lovedddd this place. If you want an elegant Greek-themed date night place, def check this place out! 
**They have both vegetarian & meat options, small plates & shareables, AND everything is super appetizing & aesthetic! To top it all off, the service was warm & welcoming too, highly recommend this place if you're in the Newbury/Back Bay Area :)"
380,20,Krasi,5 star rating,12/7/2021,"This place was spectacular!! I was shocked how busy it gets, definitely recommend making reservations in advance especially for a big party. I had gone to celebrate a engagement and staff was very attentive and answered all our questions. We ended up doing feast for gods, which basically consisted of each plate menu other than a few items that ranged from vegetarian to meat dishes. It's definitely worth it if you have 8+ people. Dishes are family style sharing. Extremely organic and authentic food. Highly recommend. The setting is great for special dates or celebration. Adult setting not really a family setting."
381,21,Krasi,4 star rating,8/4/2021,"They recently introduced the brunch menu and I highly recommend for the aesthetics, taste, and service! 

Peinirli ($12): this is the egg boat looking dish that was absolutely delicious! It was super flavorful and savory, the bread/crust had the right amount of doughyness. This was my favorite thing and I would go to Krasi again just for this! The runny egg yolk also adds a nice creamyness to the dish. The metsovone cheese was absolutely amazing, providing a subtle cheese flavor that complemented the dish.

Saganaki ($14): this was a quite interesting dish because it felt very familiar and new at the same time. I liked the combination of the cheese (feta and kasseri), the egg, and the tomatoes. However, I felt like the cheese was slightly too salty for me. I've never had barley rusk but I liked that it added a crunchy texture that never became soggy! It reminded me of croutons :)

For drinks, I got the Aphrodite's Bellini and the Otto's Spritz. I personally liked the Bellini a little more because it wasn't as sweet and the spritz. I don't think that the drinks are necessarily strong but they were very delicious. 

I would definitely recommend Krasi for a nice brunch on newbury. The price point was great and I would recommend 3 dishes for 2 people to enjoy. Definitely get the drinks and the peinirli!!"
382,22,Krasi,4 star rating,3/15/2022,"It's a great place to meet friends for brunch or dinner. Drinks really rack up the bill here; the food is actually decently priced. 

The food is good but nothing is really memorable besides their dinner bread. Definitely not a place I'd crave but, again, good for the ambience."
383,23,Krasi,5 star rating,8/2/2021,"For all the places in the downtown Boston area, you would never think to find a decent new age Mediterranean spot that would blow your expectations away, but here we are! Krasi is a vibrant spot located in the Back Bay that you should definitely bookmark if you're a fan of Greek cuisine.

This place will be crowded, so book your reservation as soon as possible. Sometimes you can luck out with patio seating, but it's always good to cover your bases just in case you don't have a backup plan.

The menu is an imaginative take on traditional Greek dishes and the servings are mainly sharing plates with something for everyone, so whatever you order will be amazingly executed and satisfying. We ordered the Tzatziki Dip which was so amazing and simple, we finished the entire thing before the other dishes came out! The Tsipoura was a grilled sea bream that was not too filling. The highlight for me was their Giouvetsi (Lamb Osso Bucco). Definitely recommend ordering this if you come here. Talk about flavors that blow your mind... this is it right here.

What's even more impressive is their wine selection. If you have the appetite for it, I would suggest trying some of their selection. After all, Krasi does mean 'wine' in Greek... so why not?

A solid 5 stars all around. Thank you for your hospitality! Will definitely be back!"
384,24,Krasi,5 star rating,11/30/2021,"I cannot recommend Krasi enough. It is probably the best restaurant in Boston that I've been to. Everything from the ambiance to the food is so tastefully done, with impeccable service (thanks James!). Kudos for having many vegetarian and vegan options. I would list out my favorites but every single item we tried was fabulous, you can't go wrong! I especially loved how the tzatziki came out and you ""make it yourself""- it was a playful touch."
385,25,Krasi,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"Updating my review to 5 stars! Came back and I tried other dinner dishes and they were great - the baked chicken and pork pasta dish are incredible, as was the fried bread. I did vastly prefer the orange cake over their other desserts.

Super friendly service and more peaceful vibe when it's slower!"
386,26,Krasi,5 star rating,8/10/2021,"Made a reservation for dinner at Krasi. It is conveniently located between Newbury st and Boylston Street, we sat outside. The food here is served as tapas so we ordered four dishes for a party of two:
- Tableside Tzatziki 
- The octopus 
- The Artichoke 
- The Veal 

The table side Tzatziki is a lot of fun, served 4 slides of toasted and buttered bread with spices and a big bowl of Greek yogurt the waiter adds in Olive Oil with Salt and Pepper. Then gives you instructions where you can add vinegar, garlic, and dill then you can mix and eat it. The portion of the Tzatziki is huge but the flavors of the yogurt is fantastic and so fun to make. 

The octopus (xtapodi) was grilled octopus that was very tender you could cut the octopus with your fork and did not need a knife, it was not too chewy and had a wonderful grilled taste. Underneath there was this pure made of yellow split beans with a subtle sweetness of honey, it was quite delicious. On top there were micro greens which added a crispness. 

The Artichoke had a vinegary taste with baby artichokes, this little whole pearl onions, peas, sunchokes, and carrots. The flavors were quite good and they worked fairly well together but did not taste as much artichoke as I expected. 

The veal (sofrito) which was like served almost in a stew like consistency had very tender veal with veggies around it like shallots and garlic. The presentation for this dish was very home style and nothing fancy. 

Overall, the food was delicious and I will certainly be back"
387,27,Krasi,5 star rating,12/6/2021,"My best part of the Boston trip! Absolutely fall in love with this place. The interior was well decorated and the server at the bar table was so nice. She did give us good recommendations on food choices and the dishes were so so good! The lamb is my fav, very well seasoned but not overwhelming, the texture was tender and moist. I also loved their chocolate dessert a lot! Prolly the best dessert I've had this year. If I ever visited Boston again I will def come back to Krasi!"
388,28,Krasi,5 star rating,4/11/2022,An incredible experience from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. The staff and owner were warm and welcoming. The ambiance was comfortable and cool. The food and wine selection were outstanding. They made my birthday extra special. Will definitely go back whenever in Boston.
389,29,Krasi,4 star rating,6/7/2021,"Love the food and ambiance here! I've been wanting to try krasi because we typically frequent tapas bars and I was hoping they would have some smaller items to share. We went late on a Sunday and were able to grab bar seats immediately. 

We ordered the htipiti (whipped feta with chicken skin chips), giouvariakia (steak taretare), and the bourdeto (grouper with sauce). The steak was presented beautifully and to die for. All the food is a bit small/pricey but good and worth trying.

Service was fine and wine recs were good. We will be be back!"
390,30,Krasi,5 star rating,4/11/2021,"Great place with amazing food, service( Amber was our server), music, vibes... everything about this place is top notch. 
Food was delicious! We came for brunch and loved it. Portions are quite big. They added dividers between the seats so there is more safe distance per Covid. 
I highly recommend this place!"
391,31,Krasi,5 star rating,3/30/2022,"I have been mulling over how to express my sheer delight in regards to the dinner I had at Krasi last night. Myself and a group of 6 others came to Krasi to celebrate my 29th birthday, and we were blown away by the quality and attention the staff put into every aspect of our meal. 5/7 of us have been in the service industry for 10+ years, myself included, so we've made it a goal to seek out some of the best places in Boston and beyond. 

Truly, Krasi has moved into the top 3 restaurants for me hands down. We chose to do the feast of the gods, an option that includes everything on the menu excluding the charcuterie and cheese (though we added a few cheeses for good measure- but my gods the feast is truly a feast). 4 bottles of wine and three courses later, we had to be wheeled out in a state of euphoria. Our server Alex was phenomenal, as were the back waiters and support staff. The made us all feel attended too and special without ever being overbearing, and their attention to detail was artful. Alex came through with two amazing orange wine recommendations, and sorted through our jumbled requests for a perfect light red. I can not sing my praises enough- I will be coming back again and again because what you all do here is inspiring. From the decor and table-wear (which is BEAUTIFUL) to the desserts and the espresso- I can not recommend Krasi enough. Do yourself a favor and reserve your next night out here  thank you for a phenomenal birthday."
392,32,Krasi,5 star rating,3/24/2022,We walked in without a reservation but were able to grab a spot at the bar and had a fantastic meal Alexandra as our bartender/server. Great Greek wines paired perfectly with some of the best ultra-fresh food we've ever had. We will absolutely be back!
393,33,Krasi,5 star rating,11/8/2021,We recently had brunch at Krasi- super good food wine and cocktails. The menu reads from sweet to savory - we tried fried pancakes - savory pita with fried egg - excellent lamb special - amazing - bloody Mary's and then some vino - service great - food delicious - great start to the day! We will be back.
394,34,Krasi,5 star rating,9/16/2021,"Absolutely wonderful. Krasi is a well oiled machine run by knowledgeable servers and talented chefs. 

Fit with majority of small, shareable dishes, this place was perfect for a birthday dinner with friends. We split a bottle of delicious and reasonably priced wine. And ordered about 10 small plates to share amongst the group. 

Everything that came out was absolutely delicious. If you're with a bigger group, they offer a deal where you can get everything on the menu for under $400. 

Aside from the food, the restaurant is clean, inviting, and stunning.

I would come back any day."
395,35,Krasi,4 star rating,11/27/2021,"I've come to Krasi twice now, and both times enjoyed the experience but had some mixed feelings.

Service:
The servers are really nice and helpful. In terms if ambience, I wish that their outdoor patio were heated, as it can get quite cold having dinner at night.

Food:
Some highlights include the make your own Tzatziki sauce: it's a hit with groups and comes with some humorous instructions. The tzatziki comes with bread but could perhaps use some more bread. 

The salata is one of my favorite salads of all time - it tastes very fresh and has a good mix of textures. 

I was a little disappointed by the chicken (KOTOPOULO LEMONATO), which lacked flavor and had bones inside. 

The orange cake for dessert redeemed it though - I might come here in the future just for this cake! It is somehow infused with orange flavor and comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that pairs perfectly."
396,36,Krasi,5 star rating,4/19/2021,"Was able to squeeze in a last call brunch yesterday. Note that they don't seat in between brunch and dinner so ensure that you aren't going in an off hour because I did see some folks get turned away.

Was popping in just for a snack and a glass of wine but I will 100% be back for more! The dips were out of this world, so flavorful, and beautifully plated. It was accompanied with some toasted bread, a bit oily, but I loved it. Only thing I wished for was some more bread to finish off the dips with but we got the pita which went well with the leftover dip. Not sure it's totally clear but the pita is filled with cooked veggies (no meat). 

Service was great, bathrooms were clean (Aesop soup and lotion!!), atmosphere vibrant. Definitely recommend - go now!"
397,37,Krasi,5 star rating,2/8/2022,"Fun spot for brunch! Tapas style Greek dishes, a unique brunch experience! Sweet and savory options, as well as brunch cocktails."
398,38,Krasi,3 star rating,1/19/2021,"Been dying to try Krasi ever since I walked by it on my way to Select Oyster a few months ago.   Decor is trendy and romantic and it felt as if everything was by candlelight.  Pictures on the wall were of various prominent Greek figures (e.g., Pythagoras and Poseidon) in humorous poses which we thought were cool.   Service won points as well as our friendly server was professional, attentive and offered us menu suggestions and guided us on the number of dishes to order.

As for the meal itself, there were some dishes that we enjoyed more than others but the common undertone throughout was that they were all quite salty.  Since I lean on the side of savory over sweet, I was surprised that even I thought the food had too much salt.  

Out of the 3 dishes I personally had (SO had other meat items), the Xtapodi which is the brussels sprouts salad was the favorite.  The preparation was very unique with lots of added crunch from the pomegranate and pumpkin seeds.   This is a must order.

As another app, we tried the papoutsakia ""little shoes"" and while I loved the eggplant and mushrooms mix, we thought it had a little too much cheese for the veggie ratio; Could be a personal preference though.  

The politiki came out last as the larger dish and the octopus was very very tender.  However, the rest of the dish with the hilopites (greek pasta) was heavy handed with salt and tomato sauce.   

Overall, it was more like a 3.5 rating with a 5 for ambience and service but lowered for some of the food.  I would give it another go though if someone suggested it.  Could be that there are other dishes like the Xtapodi that we didn't get to try!"
399,39,Krasi,5 star rating,7/22/2021,"Krasi has one of the most beautiful interiors out of all the restaurants I have been to. Honestly, I didn't really understand their menu dish names, but just show your server pictures and it'll be all good. Each dish was gorgeous and also tasted great. My favorite was the french toast, and we also ordered the omelet and smoked salmon plate which was both really good. 

The prices aren't too bad, especially for Back Bay. Two of us were full after 3 plates (they are meant to be shared) which totaled to about $65 after tip. Expect a wait even at uncommon hours, but the staff is very nice and accomodating about seating. We didn't have a reservation for Saturday at 1 PM but were given two bar seats!"
400,40,Krasi,4 star rating,12/16/2021,"This place has a wonderful cozy atmosphere, good service, interesting food, and great wines. I especially liked that they had retsina and a variety of spirits. We probably had ten different dishes and enjoyed almost all of them. I liked the meat dishes especially from the rotisserie. The space is small so seating is tight, noise level is high, and social distancing isnt happening. But I am a fan and look forward to going again."
401,41,Krasi,5 star rating,12/13/2021,"We stopped here for brunch on a Sunday at 10:30 and the place was already filled up. We didn't have reservations but only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. The restaurant is cozy and festive with all of the holiday decorations, lots of Britney Spears and lots of Santa hats. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and attentive. It is tapas style and recommended to have 1-2 tapas per person. For our party of 4, we ended up ordering 6 tapas and had leftovers to take home. Each dish was wonderfully presented and didn't disappoint. We did end up getting the lamb and I was surprised how tender and delicious it was. I'm not usually a fan of lamb since it needs to be prepared a certain way, but they did a great job. I tried the Bellini which was quite good and I ended up ordering another. Not too sweet. I'd caution against eating the apricot, it tastes like it is infused with some type of liquor. My friend got the Bloody Mary which isn't a traditional Bloody Mary and ended up being more on the sweet side. Overall, a great experience. Would return again soon!"
402,42,Krasi,4 star rating,1/16/2021,"Krasi is a great little restaurant in Back Bay! Our server, Amber, was so great and very knowledgeable. We weren't too familiar with fancy Greek food, so she told us a bit about it. She recommended 4 plates between 2 people as they are shared plates. 
Our favorite plate were the Brussels sprouts that tasted so light and fresh with some pomegranate seeds. Next, we loved the mushroom pita (the pita is a special which changes). The veal dish was also very good -- a bit on the heavier side but the flavor is was very good and veal was very tender. We also had the octopus which we had high hopes for! We didn't love the acidity of the tomato sauce with the octopus. Our least favorite was the salted cod, as it was too salty and reminded me of fish and chips. 
Overall, a very good experience that had some surprising hits and misses. I would recommend to try as something different!"
403,43,Krasi,5 star rating,6/18/2021,"Just picture yourself in one of those Greek Islands. I haven't been to the Greek Islands yet but this restaurant probably gave me a big push to imagine what it's like and hop on a plane. The food is amazing in Krasi. The food is authentic Greek and they make everything fresh on site. I am going to go here on a regular basis. I fell in love with the Teramasalata, the lamb shank and the grilled octopus. It was sooooo good. The eggplant was just as good and I really enjoyed the orange cake for dessert. The service and staff were delightful.  I can't say anything more than I love this place and you'd be a fool not to try this restaurant out."
404,44,Krasi,5 star rating,2/27/2022,"I went to this place the other night with a friend and we had a great experience. Although it was busy, it was still great service. The food we got was outstanding, and though we aren't big drinkers - drinks were great too. Can't wait to go back!"
405,45,Krasi,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"Delicious food through and through. If you come here, you have to have the Portokalopita for dessert. Truly amazing! Lovely ambiance. This is perfect for a date"
406,46,Krasi,5 star rating,6/12/2021,"Absolutely love this place! I came for brunch with some of my friends and we were seated in the front by the windows. Really beautiful restaurant, from the decor to the furniture and plates, it had a really classic city-restaurant vibes. 

Everything is to share so between the 3 of us, we ordered 4 main dishes and it was perfect. We had the trahana, the dips, the strapatsada, and the avga me patates. We also ordered one baklava muffin just to try! Honestly everything was SO good!!! Both savory plates (strapatsada and avga) were delicious and I'd highly recommend trying both! I can't pick just one! The dips were a nice side, and they offered you more bread if you ran out. The baklava muffin was so yummy, I probably could have ordered my own! It was sweet but a nice extra little side to accompany everything else. My least favorite was the trahana. Nothing wrong with it, it just wasn't my cup of tea. It reminded me of an acai bowl in a way with all the things inside of it. Probably wouldn't get this one again. I also ordered the Aphrodite's Bellini for a cocktail. Perfect, sweet, brunch drink if you want something other than a classic mimosa! 

Overall my experience here was 10/10. From the food to the service to the atmosphere, I get why people love this place so much. I will most definitely be back for brunch again and to try their dinner menu!!"
407,47,Krasi,5 star rating,12/26/2021,Stopped in on a whim and luckily they had one last table left. The food is AMAZING. Every single dish (and we had many) was special and fresh. This is a do not miss spot and definitely one of the best on Newbury.
408,48,Krasi,4 star rating,9/24/2021,"Heard about Krasi through a friend and decided to try it out with my sister. The hostess was a bit rude but other than that everything was amazing. The l tzatziki was *chefs kiss*
I would definitely recommend but make a reservation! The bartender was also super friendly and walked us through the menu/different tapas options."
409,49,Krasi,4 star rating,5/17/2021,"I'm quickly coming to the realization that most (not all) of the restaurants on Newbury street are super overpriced, and Krasi is no exception. Honestly, I Loved Krasi for what it was - super unique mediterranean tapas with a boujee twist. The ambiance is amazing (rustic and fancy) and the plating is beautiful. A lot of the dishes were things I have never head of or tried before, let alone things I could pronounce properly (try saying giouvarlakia three times) but was pleasantly surprised. I came with a group of 6 people and the bill came out to about $450 not including tip (we also ordered a $75 bottle of wine to share for the table). 

We ordered:
Charcuterie & Cheese 
+ OCTOPUS MORTADELLA - House made pistachio, peppercorns, lamb suet
+ LOUKANIKO - Attica, pork, orange zest, cognac
+ SFELA - Messinia, sheep milk
+ METSOVONE - Metsovo, cow's milk, semi-hard, smoked

Apps
+ TZATZIKI  - Greek yogurt, cucumber, dill, garlic, sea salt, sourdough, make it yourself
+ LALANGIA - fried dough, thyme honey
+ PITA - fresh oven-baked savory pie,

Entrees
+ XTAPODI - grilled octopus, Santorini fava, carob honey
+ GIOUVARLAKIA - filet mignon tartare, crispy rice, Krokos Kozanis, chilled avgolemono, dill oil
+ BOURDETO - fresh catch, onion, garlic, red pepper, spicy tomato broth

Out of everything, we loved the tzatziki (a fun group activity) and the bourdeto (super hefty and best bang for your buck) and grilled octopus, which is a staple in any mediterranean meal. The charcuterie and cheese boards were super easy to share and the bread that comes with this for dipping to die for. I thought the portion sizes for most of the things we ordered (except for the tzatziki which was enough for 6 people) were severely lacking relative to the price. I'd highly recommend ordering at least 3-4 items per person if you're coming in a group since the sizes are tapas sized and not ""regular"" entrees. They also have something called the feast of the gods which comes at a hefty $349 with additional $$ if you want wine pairings, however this is a good way to get a taste of everything and leave full. 

Overall, I thought the food was presented beautifully. Definitely was overpriced for what you get but at the end of the day, my friends and I had a great time and loved how shareable most of the food was (ie. One bite each and it's gone). Wish the table space was a bit bigger - felt like we were sitting on top of each other and constantly elbowing each other since all of the tapas couldn't fit on top of the table when they came out. this isn't a place I'd frequent on the regular but it's definitely somewhere I would come for a special occasion on a beautiful spring day!"
410,50,Krasi,2 star rating,12/20/2021,"Went with one of my Greek friends, super excited to try this place out. Had to make a reservation 2 weeks ahead of time and didn't get anything until 9pm. Ordered tzatziki which you have to make yourself, sorry but I'm not there to be a chef. Ordered the octopus motradella, it was ok but nothing out of this world. Just some octopus with bread. For entree ordered the pastitio rollo, cinnamon flavor was very strong but pretty good, nothing out of this world. Then we also ordered the giouvetsi which was not great. The orzo was good but the meat was all fat and honestly not flavorful. The only good thing was the desert. Waiters were very nice. Very disappointed in the quality of food here. would not come back"
411,51,Krasi,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"Super cute brunch place! The vibes and staff were so lively and inviting and the food was amazing. The menu goes from sweet at the top to savory at the bottom. Portion-wise, the plates were smaller than a full meal but larger than tapas style. (To give you an idea of it, we ordered 4 dishes for 3 people) 

My favorite amongst all that I ordered was the avga me patates. I loved their savory flavors more but that's also just because I love savory. 

I also got their iced latte to help me start the morning and it was pretty strong, just what I needed. 

Overall, amazing experience. 10/10 would recommend!"
412,52,Krasi,4 star rating,1/31/2022,"What an excellent new restaurant in Boston's Bay Bay!! This is a great spot for high end Greek food. I came here with my work colleague on a Sunday evening and the vibes were immaculate. Very clean and modern restaurant with an extensive wine menu. We ordered a beautiful orange wine called Paleokerisio that had a hint of sparkle. For food, we ordered the Tiropita honey rolls with Htipiti whipped feta dip. We also ordered the Papoutsakia Little Shoes eggplant and Pastisio Rollo braised short rib. The food was wonderfully prepared and fresh off the stove, I could tell each dish was made with love! The textures and presentation were on point. I personally would have preferred a bit more flavor in every dish but this could perhaps be because I'm Indian and I love my spices! The Tiropita honey rolls could have had more filling but they were soft and decadent. I thought the portion size was large for being mezzo style, I wasn't able to finish my meal but I took it to go! Overall an excellent new restaurant in Boston with a prime location across from Prudential Center. I highly recommend checking out this place if you're looking for new European with excellent wine pairings. Staff are very hospitable as well!"
413,53,Krasi,5 star rating,12/3/2021,"I am still a huge fan of this place. Have since taken a couple of Michelin-level foodies & budding oenophiles and everyone has been impressed (even those coming from LA & London). Love the selection of orange and natural wines. Have found their servers are always knowledgeable and helpful. Shout out to Nick, who I think has helped us out a couple of times. Our group sampled the tableside tzatziki (HUGE), fried potatoes, olives (available off-menu), & olive bread and everything was delicious. The vibe is trendy & sexy and a little loud. 

Excellent service touches, from the pressed herbs in the menu to wine tastes and occasional bonus dishes. I am blown away by them having not one but TWO Aesop hand soaps in the restrooms. Make sure you visit the restroom for those luxury botanicals. Hand hygiene is very important these days!"
414,54,Krasi,4 star rating,5/22/2021,"I came here with some of my friends to celebrate our college graduation. We made a reservation and were seated right when we got there at the large table all the way in the back. The menu was very new to us as we weren't familiar with Greek cuisine. Our server was very helpful in explaining the menu items, answering questions, and offering suggestions. 

We got a bottle of white wine to split among the 5 of us. We chose it based on the server's recommendation after we told him we wanted something sweeter and not too pricey. 

As for food, we were quite overwhelmed with all the different options despite our server helping us as much as he could. He suggested that we just do a ""chef's choice"" type of thing, which sounded great to us. We opted for around 10 dishes, and we got to try a wide range of things from pretty much every section of the menu.

Some of my favorites were from the seafood section: makaronada (lobster pasta), xtapodi (grilled octopus), and bourdeto (fish of the day in a spicy tomato broth). 

We also had the giouvetsi (lamb osso buco with orzo) which was great as well.

The other dishes I tried were also good but not as memorable to me so I probably wouldn't order them again.

Overall I would recommend this place! It's a bit expensive, especially considering the dishes are meant to be shared tapas style so you should order 2+ plates per person. However, the atmosphere is nice and the service is great so it would be a good setting to celebrate a graduation, birthday, anniversary, etc."
415,55,Krasi,5 star rating,11/9/2021,I've been for both brunch and dinner. All I can say is I'm so glad this restaurant opened. I love Greek food and there were enough vegetarian options. The outside and inside are both amazing. Highly recommend.
416,56,Krasi,5 star rating,12/27/2021,"We had our first (but not last) visit to Krasi last night.  The restaurant is super cute and cozy.  Our server, Jeremiah, was amazing.  He was upbeat, attentive and knew the menu very well.  He made great recommendations and we were not disappointed!

The restaurant has a pretty impressive wine selection.  The food was delicious and portioned to share.  We tried Louza (under charcuterie), paired with a selection of a couple of cheeses.  The board was beautiful and the food was great!  We also tried the Souvla (which happened to be pork) and the Pastitsio Rollo....amazing!  The star of our selection for me, however, were the Trahano Kroketes.  That was incredibly amazing!

My now fiancée proposed to me during this dinner.  The staff was super helpful and sweet helping him get it all ready and presented us with champagne to toast.  Overall, it was a pretty amazing experience.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone and I can't wait to visit and bring friends!"
417,57,Krasi,5 star rating,7/26/2021,"You must go to krasi IMMEDIATELY!! This is hands down the best restaurant in Boston, not an exaggeration!! I've been to a lot of restos in this city, and never have I ever been transported to another world through the flavors and ambiance I was experiencing. Not only is the food AMAZING, but the vibes were great, the staff was helpful and friendly, and my friend and I truly felt welcomed. We will definitely be coming here until the end of time. 

Also, great date spot!"
418,58,Krasi,3 star rating,5/11/2021,"TDLR: Krasi has a really well designed trendy look with nice ambiance. You can see the cooks cooking as they are seated on the other side of the bar. The food is decently priced however the flavours just aren't there and dishes lack a well paired sauce like you might expect at a Mediterranean place. 

The long:
 It's clear the owner hired a designer for this place. Everything from the flatware to the plates is gorgeous. The look of everything there has been carefully selected to flow with everything else and it does. This results in a really nice ambiance and atmosphere. 
The staff are very relaxed and the right amount of attentive. One of our main dishes the veal just wasn't pleasant and our waitress without asking brought it away and subbed the chicken in for us. I hate sending anything back but this was truly appreciated. 

The wild boar appetizer we ordered was by far the best thing there with homemade mustard and olive oiled bread. It tasted great and everything complimented each other nicely. 
The lobster pasta had a very healthy amount of lobster in it however they were all tails which disappointed me a little as the tails are far more chewy then claws. This results in a situation where you finish the pasta but just keep chewing on this lobster. The lobster was just boiled and the dish in whole lacked a specific direction of flavour or any sauce, it heavily relied on the natural flavor of the lobster. 
The slow cooker veal was more a soggy kind of mush unfortunately. There wasn't much flavour and was just unpleasant at least for me. I really wish it had some crispy something going on so everything wasn't just mush and some type of sauce with some serious direction of flavour. 
The chicken, this was good but a bit dry and overall again lacked suace or flavour. It was alright chicken, but for the 16 or 18 they charge I wish it wasn't so dry and had a creative direction taken to it as far as falvour goes 

Don't get me wrong the food wasn't bad by any means, it was alright but it was just alright. The service is pretty good, and the place looks gorgeous and very trendy. They definitely have something going here the food just needs to be worked on a little in my opinion."
419,59,Krasi,5 star rating,3/9/2022,This must be visit restaurant. Its one the best and fantastic place. This place is really wonderful and has excellent interior setting with pleasant atmosphere. The menu is fantastic. The food is really well-prepared and never so disappointing. I like the Tiropita Rolls and Lamb Osso Buco taste really delicious. Other food is must try! So keep coming back for more.
420,60,Krasi,5 star rating,4/24/2021,"Amazing meal- had such a nice vibe & was fairly priced.  This place allows you to try many different flavors through small plates & served elevated Greek food.  My favorites of the night were the Giouvetsi (lamb orzo) & the Portokalopita (orange cake).  

There's something for everybody- definitely check this place out!!!"
421,61,Krasi,5 star rating,6/12/2021,"An absolutely wonderful experience! Every dish was amazing but surprisingly the tiropita rolls were the star of the show! If you come, definitely start your meal with a few rolls. 

Every dish that came out was so flavorful and each had a unique taste. One of the dishes you must try is the ARTICHOKE A LA POLITA! Everyone at my table LOVED this dish.

Are server was awesome and even ended out night with delicious complimentary shots! 

Next time I come, I will definitely bring a larger group and try the FEAST OF THE GODS which has pretty much everything on the menu other than the cheese and charcuterie items."
422,62,Krasi,5 star rating,3/28/2021,"Such a great take out meal! I havent had a meal that I enjoyed everything from beginning to end in a while. Everything was delicious! Savory pie had a nice crust, braised octopus was perfect, enjoyed the sea bass crudo, orzo in lamb osso buco was nice and creamy, and the brussel sprouts and promegranate  combination was just right to cut through the heaviness of some of the other dishes. For dessert,  orange cake and kaimaki ice cream!! Cant wait to try some of their other menu items!"
423,63,Krasi,5 star rating,12/16/2021,The food here is so incredible. And if you don't know what to get the staff will walk you through the menu. I love bringing friends here for dinner it's a whole experience. So unique. Amazing wine list.
424,64,Krasi,4 star rating,4/6/2021,"A very fun night out for Greek tapas with options to dine outside on Gloucester Street, inside at a table or bar-side.  We had fun mixing our own tzaziki followed by more shared small plates of moussaka (rich eggplant bechamel), pita (reminds me of pizza- not my fav of the 6 we tried), lamb osso buco ( fabulous), pork rotisserie, fresh catch grouper (melt in your mouth).  Service was very attentive with our friendly server in training and his mentor and he made wine recommendations.  We felt well looked after with others dropping off items to the table so everything was served as soon as it came out.  We did not have room for dessert.  Would definitely go back."
425,65,Krasi,1 star rating,10/18/2021,"Honestly, the food here is average at best and IMO it's overrated and too expensive for what it is. But the reason for the 1 star? This place does fine in terms of business and they aren't hurting for money. For an establishment off Newbury street, this place sure does skimp on customer comfort. We were seated outside along with the other half of the restaurant with weather in the low 50s with a strong breeze and they don't even have heat lamps out here. I'm shivering my ass off as I write this and can't even seem to get a waiters attention to put our food in. Not rushing back here anytime soon, but def avoid at all costs in the cooler months if they do not have indoor seating available.

EDIT: Just had a massive Rat run into my leg. I guess this isn't their fault as we're eating outside, but this is the first time in my life this has happened, even after living in NY 10 years"
426,66,Krasi,5 star rating,10/10/2021,"I've been here twice: once on my own and once with my husband.  I absolutely love sitting at the bar, which overlooks the grill/cook area.  It's dinner & a show.   The food is amazing but what makes things extra special is the amazing friendly staff.  They make you feel so welcome and special.  We tried a bunch of the dishes and all were amazing but my favourites are: the TZATZIKI dip, PAPOUTSAKIA ""LITTLE SHOES""  eggplant, TSIPOURA  grilled sea bream, and the lamb Osso buco.  This is the kind of place I could become a regular!"
427,67,Krasi,5 star rating,5/14/2021,"This place was amazing!! The waiter was very knowledgeable about the wines and he let me try a bunch of wines to make sure I liked them. You can describe the type of wine you typically like and they'll suggest a wine for you. 

The food was delicious. Definitely come here with someone who will share plates with you and make sure to sit at the bar on the very right side. You get to see all the food being prepped and scope out what dishes to order. Also the guy prepping and directing the food was my favorite. I asked him what every dish coming out of the kitchen was and he was super helpful and made the dinner so much more enjoyable."
428,68,Krasi,5 star rating,8/30/2021,"This is one of those places you think about not reviewing so no one else can find it but...obviously people will find it, and honestly they deserve all the stars. Came in for a late night snack and wine date and were happy with all of our choices. Our waiter (I'm sorry I forgot your name!) Had wonderful recommendations for folks new to Greek wines and the orange and red we had were spot on to the preferences we had mentioned. Topped things off with some bread (you could come for just the bread...) and octopus, and know we'll be back soon to try other parts of the menu. 

Ambiance was beautiful, we were neatly spaced out from others at the bar, and getting to watch the kitchen do their magic was just the cherry on top. If you catch them on a good weather night, their outdoor setup is real cute too."
429,69,Krasi,5 star rating,4/30/2021,"This place was AMAZING. The staff, the food, the atmosphere, all great! To start off I had made a reservation for a Wednesday evening (didn't think it would be busy but it was so make a reservation) and the staff member had called to confirm that day. I had mentioned that the website said only bar seating was available so I booked that, but asked if we could have a table, if they happen to have one open when we showed up. No worries if they didn't. 

When we showed up the place was very busy, and they had actually given us this giant table for about 8 in the back, just us two. It was very kind of them to do this. Next, we had both gotten sparkling rosé, which my boyfriend was not very familiar with but loved. The waiter was very patient with us and explained how the ordering/meal was supposed to go, and when we did order he made it so we would get things at different times (in an order he chose with us), to make it so we didn't just get everything at one. 

Here's what we got and in which order he did it for us: 
1. Lalangia bread (so warm and sweet, highly recommend)
2. Mastelo cheese (also highly recommend)
3. Tzatziki (make it yourself, which was a very cool concept. Ran out of bread so they brought us over veggies as well!)
4. Lavraki (I've never had sea bass, and just the presentation in itself was awesome)
5. Giouvetsi (This lamb plate was like a stew, and was very heavy, but tasty) 

Overall I would recommend getting about 4 plates for 2 people, even though 5 is recommended. 

We finished off with the kormos which was also different and delicious!"
430,70,Krasi,5 star rating,4/5/2021,"I don't know what I was expecting but this blew us all away. Each dish was better than the first. A restaurant that can serve ""plain"" rotisserie chicken and makes you want 10 orders of it- that's a best of the best restaurant. We started with cocktails- the mango mimosa was so delicious. smoked salmon. dips. Two different egg dishes. The chicken. And ended with the sweet bread- I can't wait to go back here."
431,71,Krasi,5 star rating,4/4/2021,Went there again for brunch! Great service and great food! Krasi never disappoints me! Highly recommend the Greek coffee! It tastes like Turkish coffee and I loved it!
432,72,Krasi,5 star rating,7/28/2021,"So Krasi is the best restaurant in Boston for Greek and Mediterranean food. I'd end my review there but I will highlight why Krasi needs to be the next restaurant you visit.

Krasi doesn't just pass the vibe check, it is the vibe. It's an intimate location tucked between Boylston and Newbury. The place is buzzing and always has groups of people waiting outside in hopes of snagging a last minute cancelled reservation. I once made a 10pm reservation because I simply couldn't end my night without eating here.

The wine and drink list is A+. I highly recommend the orange wine. I'm not much of a wine drinker but the orange wine on their menu is light and refreshing.

When you're ready to order, there is nothing you could get that wouldn't be good. Seriously every single item on the menu is fantastic. However you must get the Htipiti, the table side tzatziki, the patates (omfg my mouth is watering), daily pita, Skioufikta, and daily souvla. Oh and I just made a reservation for this weekend.

The service is also top notch. The staff is knowledgeable and very good with recommendations for food and drink pairings.

I really can't say enough good things about Krasi. If people ask me where they should eat when visiting or locals wanting to try something new, Krasi is the first restaurant I recommend. Thank you for existing"
433,73,Krasi,5 star rating,3/15/2022,"Do you go to other restaurants? Stop. Just stop, and before you do, come here first because wherever you are going isn't as good as here. Still the best restaurant in the city for two years. chris is still running this place better than ever."
434,74,Krasi,3 star rating,7/16/2021,"Beautiful, friendly and super hot spot. We dined at the bar and could not have been more graciously trreated. The food unfortunately was mostly a chip dip small plated. The deconstructed taromasolata was terrible. If you can imagine ordered pimento cheese and getting a block of cheese with peppers poured overtop, you get the idea. All Greek wine list no AF options."
435,75,Krasi,5 star rating,8/17/2021,"Delicious food and great service! Especially loved the table Tzaziki which involves the customer, having you mix the ingredients into the yogurt. Really fresh food and amazing wine."
436,76,Krasi,5 star rating,1/15/2022,"Incredible. We got the Noumboulo, Htipiti, TRAHANO KROKETES, GIOUVETSI, and PORTOKALOPITA. Would recomend all. Smaller dishes so I recommend sharing about four between two people. Incredible service and a great music selection."
437,77,Krasi,5 star rating,9/24/2021,"Went for dinner and drinks on a week day afternoon. Krasi was bustling, with great food and an extensive Greek wine list. The service was wonderful. We also really enjoyed the atmosphere. Would definitely recommend!"
438,78,Krasi,5 star rating,7/8/2021,"I stumbled on this place upon my Yelp searches and had been wanting to try it for some time. We decided to go with another couple and made a reservation- which is a must! Even with our reservation, we still needed to wait for about 20 minutes before we were able to be seated. This was ok as our friends were running a little behind. The place was absolutely packed, and rightfully so. We were seated and our waiter gave us the low down of the menu. He was extremely friendly and helpful. A friend of mine had recommended the orange wine that they serve there so that was immediately what we asked for. They have 3 types of orange wine so we were unsure of which one to get. The waiter was very helpful and pointed us to their most popular orange wine- Vlahiko/DEBINA. It's a semi-sparkling wine with almost a beer after taste. Definitely unique. 

As Krasi is a a tapas bar essentially, we were told that for 4 people we should order anywhere from 8-10 dishes. We opted in for the following: 

-Lanlangia: their freshly baked fried dough. Very tasty and definitely worth trying! (8.6/10) 
-Graviera: a hard nutty sheep milk cheese. Comes with bread too! (8.2/10)
-Tzatziki: this was a fun one! We actually were able to make the dip in front of us. The waiter brought out all of the ingredients with some directions of how and what to add to make it just right. We were also able to take the directions home so we could make the dip there as well! The dip also comes with a basket of bread so no need to order extra. (8.7/10)
-Salata: this was a super flavorful salad. I'm not much of a salad gal but I would 100% order this again. Super refreshing and tasty. (8.9/10)
-Patates: exactly what it sounds like. They are essentially like home fries with a very faint lemon flavor. (7.8/10)
-Papoutsakia ""Little Shoes"": very good! Especially if you like eggplant and cheese and mushrooms! Worth the try! (8.5/10)
-Makaronada: tasty lobster dish! (8.5/10)
-Skioufikta: was not a fan of this. Was VERY Smokey in flavor. However, the others seemed to like it! (7.2/10)
-Giovetsi: I thought this was decent, but everything else we ordered seemed to be better than this (7.8/10) 

We definitely ordered the right amount. I started to fill up quickly as they bring out the plates as it is ready to be served. The boys left still feeling hungry though. 

I would definitely go back! The ambiance is great, and it's a fun dining experience with great food! Highly recommend!"
439,79,Krasi,5 star rating,8/17/2020,"Really good spot! 
They have a very solid wine selection. Definitely something for every taste and prices are relatively reasonable. 
Service was really good! 
But the most important, the food, was definitely excellent! 
We had 9 dishes for 3 people, a lot of food since the portions are quite generous but everything was tasty! 
The slow cooked veal, the dips and the peach salad were our favorite!"
440,80,Krasi,5 star rating,2/2/2021,"Wow. Krasi knocked it out of the park. I cant believe this is the same owned as Committee, because I think Krasi blows that place out of the water. Similar to Committee, Krasi has a ""see-and-be-seen"" type of vibe, which is always entertaining, and the space is beautiful. I love the open kitchen concept.

It all starts with the wine list, which is comprised of nothing I've ever heard of before or could ever pronounce. Greek wine isn't massed produced like other regions of the world, so this was really neat to get to try different ones. Our waitress was very helpful to pick something out for us, based on flavor profiles that we asked for. They also had more than one orange wine, which was great to see, as its rare to see in a restaurant, but something I personally love to have to kick off a meal.

The food was all extremely flavorful and well executed. The whipped feta had a mildly spicy oil drizzled over top, and was accompanied by uber-crispy chicken skins --- such a wonderful cheat food item. The beer battered salt cod was a well balanced dish of creamy, salty, and crunchy. As far as the savory side is concerned, I thought the octopus was the star. I don't know that I've ever experienced such a subtle piece of octopus in my life; I could cut it only using a fork, which is unheard of. The Orange Cake, to end the meal, was also a delight, as it was extraordinarily moist and tasted like a freshly squeezed (but slightly sweetened) orange. Like every dish at Krasi, it was expertly balanced."
441,81,Krasi,4 star rating,8/10/2020,"Krasi was an absolute delight! I did think the meal overall was pretty expensive, but if you're going to treat yourself do it right and come here. It's a shareable small plate vibe so come with friends or go on your own, can't go wrong!

Their Htipiti dip and Midia are both must-haves! The Htipiti comes with these delicate crisp chicken skins that you basically use as chips. Perfect combo! You only get three so be sure to make the most of it. They do charge for extra chicken crisps so beware of that when they make the offer (didn't know this until we saw the check). I would encourage everyone to get some bread to start so that you can also spread the dip from the Htipiti on that as well. You will most likely have extra dip.

Now when it comes to the Midia (instantly salivates)...it literally melts in your mouth! As soon as I took the first bite I knew I ate what is my favorite dish at this restaurant. It has a sort of tempura look and flavor. Comes with 5 mussels so I recommend everyone at the table get their own so you don't have to share with anyone at your table hehehe!

FYI- If you come with a big group (5-7) consider ordering the Feast of the Gods! This includes everything on the menu except for the cheese and charcuterie boards. Great way to try everything if your group is interested."
442,82,Krasi,5 star rating,12/6/2020,"WOW WOW!

This is a must go, folks! Cuddle up in this cozy joint and enjoy some of the most authentic Greek plates offered in Boston. Upon arrival, be prepared to wine. Our fantastic waitress (Amber) took the time to walk us through the extensive wine list. 

Food, ambiance, service and so on is all 5/5. Kudos to you, Krasi!"
443,83,Krasi,4 star rating,8/1/2021,"Krasi is in a very good location and has a decent sized outdoor patio. 
It gets a 4/5 solely for the suboptimal service.  The ambience is very sweet and their cutlery is very ""old world"" and has a certain charm to it. 

Brunch: 
Strapatsada- this truly stole the show! I'm not the biggest fan of eggs or omelets, but this was absolutely delicious. The feta was not overpowering and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly. The entire dish came together really well. 5/5 ! 

Brunch dips- delicious! The htipiti and tzatziki were very delicious. The sourdough was buttery and delicious, but certainly not enough for the amount of dips. 5/5! 

Baklava muffin- this was rather underwhelming. Tasted more like corn bread with honey than baklava muffin. I didn't taste any baklava in it. 3/5!

Drinks: 
Krasi mimosa- really delicious, but I wasn't the greatest fan of the mango juice. 4/5! 

Otto's Spritz- tart but fruity! The perfect summer drink! 5/5

Service: 
We were first greeted by someone who I can imagine was the owner/ manager. He was incredibly polite and welcoming and seated us right away. But unfortunately, things went downhill from there. Our waiter barely checked in on us and it took two attempts to just get water!!! At 3pm, told us that their kitchen would be closing and asked if we wanted to put in any other orders (which is rather odd for the kitchen to close between brunch and dinner on a weekend!). We thanked him and said no. We had finished our meal, 20 minutes went by and he didn't come by at all. Unfortunately, I think this may have been just this one waiter, as we noticed that another waiter was very attentive to other tables. Once he finally came back, he asked ""just the check then?"" Honestly, I really would have liked another drink, but I was very annoyed by him, so we just paid and left."
444,84,Krasi,5 star rating,1/8/2022,"Went here on a Saturday at 11 and got in right away with no wait or reservations. One thing that stood out to me were the delicious drinks! I tried both the Aphrodite's Bellini which had apricots and and the Krasi Mimosa with mango. The drinks were refreshing and delicious! In regards to food, I had the Solomo which had smoked salmon, lemon dill cream cheese and carob bread. Honestly it was one of the tastiest things I've ever had! The Trajan's was refreshing and tasty as well. It had fresh figs and fruits and was absolutely delicious. Overall, great experience and ambiance. Very vibrant and fun and the food and drinks were delicious."

446,86,Krasi,3 star rating,12/22/2021,"The place is a cute little Greek restaurant with excellent service! They have a great collection of Greek wines as well. 

The food - I ordered the lamb 'souvla' (grilled), the kale salad and the tuna sashimi. The lamb was very dry, tough and flavorless. The fish was not much more flavorful either. The salad was decent. 

I may give it another try"
447,87,Krasi,4 star rating,8/11/2021,"I literally don't know the name of these dishes, but we ordered the octopus and the lobster for two person. We also had a honey bread which is similar to churros. I really like the octopus especially the sauce underneath it was similar to hummus but so much better! Lobster was good too it's just a bit salty for me personally. The bread was alright it's a bit sweet and apparently my friend likes it a lot. I'll definitely come here another time just to explore some of the other things on the menu that I'm interested in."

453,3,SOJUba,5 star rating,3/26/2022,"10/10!!! Threw a 20+ person birthday party here and was super pleasantly surprised by how seamless and fun the experience was! 

They had some huge booths in the back to accommodate our large party and kept the rounds of drinks and food coming out consistently as we ordered. We tried a few different soju pitchers (lychee, strawberry yogurt, kiwi) and they were all delicious. Their appetizers were great too - some favs were the crunchy corn, soy garlic chicken wings, and kimchi pancake.

The vibes are quite dark and loud so maybe not the best place for conversations but it was great party atmosphere. Our server was super attentive and amazing - definitely order the birthday shot if you're celebrating!!!"
454,4,SOJUba,4 star rating,3/18/2022,"This place is huge. Unlike most Korean drinking spots, it is great for large groups and you can make reservations. When you walk in there is a giant soju bottle decoration with a tiny sign that says don't lean on it... I'm sure that request is never followed on the daily. This place seems to be more of a staging/pregame spot before the clubs and birthday party spot. There were 3 birthday's the night I was there giving out multiple liqueur shots to the birthday boy/gal.

The food was pretty solid. Avoid the bulgolgi nachos, it's movie theatre nachos and cheese, with lack luster tomatoes and a weird sprinkling of what looked like ground beef with bulgolgi seasoning.

What to order are the boneless fried chicken, soldier stew, and the chicken gizzards. I know, chicken gizzards sound bizarre but give it a shot! One cultures exotic is normal for for others! It's a great drinking dish while you take shots of soju and converse. They crisp it up with garlic and top it off with sesame oil. The boneless fried chicken has a nice sweet sauce topped with strips of fresh scallion that brighten the dish. When the soju starts kicking in, get the soldier stew (great group dish). The origins of this meal is from the Korean War. The soldiers cooked whatever was left behind by the Americans and cooked it up in a big hot pot. It has chunks of spam, hot dogs, ramen, rice cakes and kimchi in a spicy soupy stew."
455,5,SOJUba,3 star rating,3/14/2022,"The appetizers were extremely greasy and oily. We ordered onion rings and chicken wings (original korean fried and sweet chili) but didnt finish them.

456,6,SOJUba,5 star rating,4/9/2022,"Went before 8pm...great service and a decent price. We got the corn cheese, japchae(without beef) bibimbap, and Tteok-bokki with cheese. It was 4 of us and we ended up paying about $25 each including tip. 

Highly recommend the japchae and cheese corn....my personal favorites"
457,7,SOJUba,4 star rating,1/12/2022,"I was so impressed with the kimchi pork belly and the kimchi pancake!!

In the end we got the boodae one with not only kimchi but also spam, sausages, rice cakes and rice! We also got the cylindrical spicy rice cakes on the seafood scallion pancake which was the perfect amount of thickness and quite crispy haha the vibes where immaculate but special shout-out our waiter who we love!"
462,12,SOJUba,3 star rating,12/13/2021,"** Bar / restaurant blend focused on Korean food / drinks located next to Fenway park. Good for a place to party with friends after a Sox game, but for anything else I would honestly say its extremely overpriced and not worth going out of your way for.

I came to the new location across the street on a trip to Boston after failing to get into the old location 3 years ago not knowing it was right after a Red Sox game with the entire street packed. It was absolutely a nightmare getting in and out after a game, so definitely keep that into consideration if you want to go.

I went with a group of around 5 friends, and it seems like the space has relatively bigger booths that can fit groups as well as longer tables as well. Out of the food we ordered - seafood pancake, chicken gizzard, chicken wings, jap chae, none of it was memorable or anything special. On top of all that, $18 for a bottle of soju is just straight up extortion, but I guess thats the premium you have to pay in Fenway. 

Overall the place has a bar atmosphere with loud party music playing, so if you're there to celebrate something or turn up you might enjoy it but otherwise I'd say this place is a pass."
463,13,SOJUba,2 star rating,10/23/2021,"Food: normal
Service: Shitty(not the waiters inside, but the staffs in charge of the queue)
Environment: noisy
*They check IDs for everyone no matter you order drinks or not. You should be 21+ to enter this place.

If you are looking for good foods, it's not a good choice. If the you wanna dance, the songs suck. Would not come back again. What a waste of time."
464,14,SOJUba,4 star rating,11/5/2021,"Came here on a Saturday night and the place was packed - I'd definitely recommend a reservation, especially if you're bringing more then 3 friends!

I haven't been here since they got the new space and it's HUGE - lots of tables, many TVs ( all playing kpop music videos ), and a lively atmosphere. We were seated at one of the booths and ordered over 5 pitchers throughout the course of the night along with some food. The service was pretty nice and attentive which was appreciated as our order load was gradual throughout the night. 

The food was pretty good - no complaints about anything other than the boodae jungol as the dish was just served on a plate without a heat source. As a result, the vegetables weren't cooked at all and it got cold quite quickly... Maybe they don't serve it over an open flame for security precautions? This took away from the quality of the meal overall though. 

I enjoyed the rest of the dishes - the corn was hard to eat without any spoons, but otherwise was really delicious. The chicken was crispy and cooked to perfection with a good amount of sauce, the pancake was the perfect amount of crunchy and savory, and the fries were plentiful and delicious. No complaints about those or the pitchers really - I found each one we tried ( kiwi, yogurt, lychee, and aloe ) to be flavored well. The amount of ice was a little disappointing, but there was enough for probably 8-9 shots per pitcher. My favorite flavors were probably yogurt and lychee, but all of them were delicious!

Overall, if you're looking for a fun night out with friends, SOJUba is a great place to go! I'll definitely be coming around again for another fun time, good food, nice vibes, and nice service!"
465,15,SOJUba,3 star rating,4/11/2021,"I came in a party of six on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. The front staff was kind of curt and aggressive, but I tried to not let that bother me. We were seated at two small round tables next to the bar. We asked to be moved to a booth since there were 6 of us, but the waitstaff said our party wasn't big enough... when I legit saw parties of 4 and 5 sitting at booths. It didn't make sense. 

We ordered the bugolgi, and the soy garlic fried chicken wings. The bugolgi was okay - I realized that this bar wasn't really the best place to order legit food. It tasted pretty bland, which was disappointing. The soy garlic wings, on the other hand, were so good! I literally devoured them! (I couldn't take a picture because I ate them too fast). We also got multiple beer towers and soju bottles to share. As you can imagine, the scene got pretty messy. However, everything seemed to be incredibly overpriced for the value we received. 

The service was poor. Our initial ""greeting"" from the front staff was very off-putting. Then, as we were looking at the menu, literally 3 different people came by and asked us if we were ready within a span of 3 minutes - either they don't communicate or they were being aggressive... I couldn't tell which one. Then, after we got our food, the waitstaff legit never came by. I saw them just standing in a clump and talking amongst themselves for a while. I had to walk up to the bartender to get anyone's attention. 

Overall, my friends and I had a great time, despite the overpriced food and drinks, and the less-than-stellar service. I don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon for the above two stated reasons, though."
466,16,SOJUba,3 star rating,1/10/2022,"Omg this place is so LOUD! It's definitely a club/lounge vibe. Don't come here to have conversations, because you will not be able to hear each other. 

I've gone here twice, and each time the music was trash. They were playing like Justin Bieber's baby...and a lot of other throwbacks. Wish they would've played more current music or kpop or something. It's like they're purposely trying to troll everyone. 

The watermelon soju is underwhelming...don't be fooled by the cotton candy. It looks aesthetic but is has a horrible flavor. 

I think the best drinks were probably the yogurt ones, though overpriced. The staff is also really unclear with their communication and are definitely hired based on looks rather than capability. Like either you have the drink or not, what does ""maybe"" mean  can you go check??"

468,18,SOJUba,1 star rating,8/22/2021,"Worst Korean restaurant ever. First called in to see if they are open during the Hurricane Henri weekend, the server literally told us the hours are available on Google and Yelp. Let's start with service, our server was rude as hell, apparently she was upset because the bartender wasn't flirting back with her since he was talking to the other female server the whole time. We were in a party of 3, we got a small bar table instead. We ordered 5 dishes, a small bar table wasn't gonna fit all, and she won't give us a bigger table when the restaurant was only at 10% capacity at 6:30pm. 

She never checked in on us about the food we got either. How is this even considering 'restaurant industry' service? Service like this where they don't deserve a tip

Food: cheese Katsu, that was probably the worst appetizer they could have on the menu. The fried chicken, omg they were soooooo bland. They tasted like frozen packaged goods except 7-eleven chicken prob taste better and more flavorful LOL. Corn cheese and Japchae were pretty decent 

Suggestion for Management? Go train your employees again"
469,19,SOJUba,5 star rating,12/20/2021,This place was great.  The Omelet was waaay bigger than we expected but good.  The Bulgogi Nachos was just soso but the ambience and soju made up for it.  Def expect a very loud environment and to raise your voice when talking.  We enjoyed the soju and the Kpop blasting on the flat screens!
470,20,SOJUba,2 star rating,11/16/2021,Long line just to sit at a pocha w loud music where you can barely speak to your friends. bottle service at a restaurant- 300$ per bottle just to jam at your table. Kind of ridiculous. Service kinda sucks on top of all this. Don't waste your time or money here.
471,21,SOJUba,4 star rating,8/29/2021,"Food was good, alcoholic drinks made us sober, service was meh. Like a night club vibe with music and ambience on a Friday night. Plus points for being open late as there weren't many food options that late at night. Menu is huge and can get overwhelming.

Steamed dumpling: good, how a steamed dumpling should be. Nothing that I would remember. Did not enjoy the sauce. 
Korean Fried Chicken (soy and garlic): was a hit for us and one of the more memorable dishes we tried in Boston. It was crispy and sauce was addictive with slight sweetness to it. Not the best we've ever had but it hit the spot.
Lychee Soju Pitcher: we just had ciders some place else so thought this would be a good ending to the night and get us buzzed. Thought we were being smart by ordering a pitcher. Delicious lychee flavor, but the drink somehow made us REALLY SOBER. They mixed the drinks themselves. It would probably be more worth it to get a bottle instead.

Service and ambience: service was just ok. No one was really rude, but did not feel friendly either. More like indifference and they are just doing the work and trying to get it over with. So felt like we were bothering when asking for suggestions, etc. A little slow with following up with us later on in the night. Dark and club/bar vibes.  Huge restaurant but everyone seated on one side. 

COVID precaution: employees do not wear masks. Did not notice any sanitizers. Tables are spread out a little."
472,22,SOJUba,4 star rating,12/25/2020,"I was looking for an Asian restaurant with outdoor dining and ended up finding SOJUba on Yelp. Although they had closed down for outdoor dining already, there was plenty of seating indoors to space yourself from other groups of those within your oarty safely. 

I ordered the stone bowl bibimbap, and it really hit the spot! Not sure if it was the best one I've had, but it certainly is high up there. I also was able to try the watermelon soju, which comes in an actual half-cut watermelon with cotton candy attached to it. The drink's alcohol flavor was very apparent, and not to my liking, but this may be a personal preference thing! It was very cool to get to try this drink finally since it looks so cool in the pictures. 

Definitely also appreciate the BTS music playing on the screens. Would come back after COVID-19 ends with a group for sure."

474,24,SOJUba,4 star rating,7/14/2021,"I went with a group of 7 on a Saturday night. I made a reservation and they told my friend that they couldn't find it. I got there a few minutes later and they suddenly found the reservation.

There's a two hour limit. We got a beer tower (64 oz for $85 of either budlight or Budweiser), beer and soju tower and two flavored soju bottles ($15). It is pricey. I've seen cheaper prices of flavored soju in nyc.

We also ordered three dishes: steamed dumplings, scallion pancakes, and ramyun ddok-bokghi. Steamed dumplings came within 15-20 minutes after ordering. Other dishes came an hour after ordering. Food is average, nothing special.

Came out to be about $40/person. You go for the experience and to have a good time with your friends. There are tons of big TV screens, some playing music videos (k-pop, hip-hop, pop) or sports (soccer and UFC that night)."

476,26,SOJUba,4 star rating,11/15/2021,"Sojuba was really good. The soju pitchers are really good! Got the peach one and it was amazing. Also got the scallion pancake, spicy chicken bbq and spicy beef. They were not as spicy as I would have liked but both had a ton of flavor that made up for it. Both dishes come with rice as well. The ambience is interesting and I think it turns into a lounge later into the evening. Big screens to watch the game and other videos while you eat."
477,27,SOJUba,2 star rating,2/13/2022,"The atmosphere is interesting, but nicely fun and energetic. The service on the other hand is terrible, and we basically had to beg to put an order in. The quality of the beef is very low, and dishes were brought to the table 10 minutes apart. The Korean BBQ is by no means authentic, and is way too sweet. They automatically charge 20% gratuity (click the buttons for you) and make it awkward if you question it. 

All in all, not worth the price we paid. I would not recommend."
478,28,SOJUba,4 star rating,11/19/2020,"This was my first time coming with a few of my coworkers. 

For drinks we tried their mango ice cream soju and the aloe soju pitcher. I personally preferred the aloe soju as it was less sweet and something I was able to sip on while eating. However, the mango one was an especially satisfying drink after work. 

We ordered their crunchy corn as an appetizer which came out quickly. It was salty and slightly sweet with a caramelized coating for each kernel. A very addicting dish to order. 

The entrees were ordered family style including a small order of Korean chicken wings, beef japchae and bimimbap. I loved the japchae as it was served with plenty of vegetables and tons of flavor. The bimimbap was good, the rice and veggie proportions were appropriate. The Korean fried chicken had a beautifully crunchy layer on it with a brushed on coating of sauce. The flavoring was decent but not the best I've had.

Overall, good experience and definitely would come back. When we got there at 5, we were the first ones there but it was very busy by the time we left at 7 (plan ahead)."

The only 2 problem were 
1. It took them too long to bring the food

It is ok when you are with your close friends 
But not acceptable 
Stuff are polite and fast"
485,35,SOJUba,2 star rating,8/8/2021,Came before a concert at Fenway. Hoping to go up to the roof deck but it was closed because the restaurant doesn't have enough help. It was ridiculously understaffed. On a concert day they should have been more prepared. It took 40 minutes to get our first round of drinks. 2 of us got our meals after 40 minutes and the rest of the group had to keep waiting another 30 minutes. The chicken wings were cold when they came. Food was relatively bland. Overall a bad experience. I won't be coming back. Do not recommend.

489,39,SOJUba,4 star rating,7/29/2021,"I came here for the first time last weekend and I have to say it is unique compared to other places around the area. This is one of the more well known Asian bars in Boston. They have a large menu for drinks (mostly soju based as the name hints) and an ok menu of food. I would say the food here is just for you to snack on while drink with friends rather than a meal. We ordered the corn, japchae, and fried chicken (half soy garlic, half spicy). The spicy wasn't that spicy but overall the chicken was good. We only ordered bottles of soju and the soju pitchers for drinks. The soju is much more worth than anything else bc he pitchers are super small and I'm not eve hold more than what's in one bottle of soju. This place is great to come with a large group tho!"
490,40,SOJUba,5 star rating,10/29/2021,"this place has a great vibe and the staff are very friendly and inviting, I would highly recommend and get the green apple soju. The pork dumplings are very tasty too."
491,41,SOJUba,4 star rating,9/22/2021,Great vibes and drinks. We ordering the watermelon soju that actually came in a watermelon with cotton candy. Scallion fried chicken is now my favorite over the normal wings cuz it's boneless and tastes better! The army stew however is a let down probably because it didn't come with the gas stove. It got cold quickly and the ramen noodles were soggy from the soaking not from being cooked...
492,42,SOJUba,3 star rating,6/10/2021,"Came here on a Saturday night with some gf's for a GNO, and can only say that I'm not at all impressed.

FOOD: We ordered the fish cake soup and the bibimbap. The food was good, but not excitingly fantastic. If you're looking to dine, I'd go elsewhere. 

DRINKS: We ordered 3-4 bottles of soju. As what others have said, it's definitely pricey. We also ordered a round of ""birthday shots"" which I'm pretty sure is just straight sugar in each shot.

AMBIANCE and SERVICE: Loud DJ, loud music, dark room with colorful lights and TV screens everywhere. The music that night was just okay. I usually like to dance/move my body to music, but music wasn't cutting it. The crowd leans more towards the younger spectrum (which makes sense considering it's near many of the colleges in Boston). 

Service was just okay. It took us a bit to get both food dishes out and an even LONGER time to get the birthday shots. It took so long that the birthday girl couldn't even take her shots because she had to leave (about 30 minutes). Really?"

495,45,SOJUba,2 star rating,12/21/2021,"rating this PURELY on food. as a place i would hang and get drunk at, yes i think this place is a sick bar and is a weekend contender - they actually have some pretty good soju and its better than half the junk i had living in korea for a while. so being clear on that before what im saying

the food is horrible though. barely salty and not even spicy, which is a bare minimum for decent korean/bar food. this ranges from their stews to even their pancakes, which is incredible since its hard to undersalt a scallion pancake

just laying this down for people that have never had korean food and think this is the truth. it only is in so far as your drunken calorie intake is at a blind peak"

Bon Chon all flavors are bomb (the spicy one is actually spicy), chicken katsu, boodae jungol YES with spam, kalbi tang.

500,50,SOJUba,2 star rating,11/10/2020,"I appreciate their wide selection of soju drinks, but my experiences here have always left me confused.

I first came here over a year ago when they were at their smaller location across the street. All the napkins they gave us were wet and smelled moldy. The fruit cocktail ($25) was meant for 2 people but was barely alcoholic at all. We then ordered another bottle of soju and it was expired! For a place that literally has soju in its name, I was shocked. The music was quite loud and seemed to jump through a bunch of different genres. It seemed like they couldn't decide on what vibe they wanted.

I decided to give this place a second chance and to experience their new, larger location. The music choices were still VERY confusing, but I won't hold it against them. The napkins didn't smell like mold this time, but the cups and plates we were given were still wet. We ordered a makgeolli ($15) which came in a metal pot with metal serving bowls. Maybe this was for the ""authentic aesthetic"" but the serving bowls were dented, old, and looked dirty.

The food here is decent, but I wasn't blown away to the point where I would come back for the food. I tried their wings and kimchi pancake. Portions were on the smaller side for the price."

This is the best cheesy corn I've ever had, and I always order this dish when I visit Korean restaurants. It's very flavorful and cheesy. I highly recommend. Their crunchy corn was a great snack in addition If you're looking for something sweet. Their bibimbap was also a great choice to go along with all of the other food.

On top of this, when we went to pay for the meal, our server added a 20% tip without our approval, and she was definitely not deserving of this!

509,59,SOJUba,1 star rating,9/7/2021,"Terrible experience from staff to the wait time to the food quality. 

Table of 5, seated quickly. We ordered a round of drinks, 3 beers, a sangria and a cognac.  I asked the waiter what soju was, the drink, and his reply well it's the name of the restaurant... really buddy, I know that... what is it on the menu. Very rude, so I didn't order the soju drink. Are Drinks arrived staggered, no big deal. 

We placed our appetizers and they arrived staggered 15 minutes after the other....another inconvenience that we let go by. 

We then had to flag our waitress down to place our entree order. We ordered 3 garlic noodle and Korean hot plate. One garlic noodle arrived right away.....The hot plate which was spam, cut up hot dogs and kimchi with a .50 cent ramen noodle on top, it was disgusting, arrived 20 minutes later.... The last garlic noodle arrived after we flagged down the waitress and requested our check.... We told her we didn't want it and conveniently she could no longer understand us. So we said just pack it to go and she plops it down and says I can't do that I'll get boxes. Also very rude. 

At the end we were charged $290.00 for 5 people, among us 5 only one round of drinks were ordered and 3 appetizers an appetizer that didn't get eaten at that because it arrived as we were leaving. They also added a $50 tip to the order... doing the math our total is only $193.00 and the ""mandatory"" tip which isn't stated anywhere should only be $38.40.... 

Stay away from this place. Terrible service, subpar food and shady billing. 

I'm also going to be reporting them, I truly feel they overcharged us on purpose."
510,60,SOJUba,3 star rating,8/16/2020,"The new location is a lot bigger and has rooftop seating. Unfortunately if you sit on the rooftop there's a limited menu. Before being seated, we were told we couldn't order any hotpot, stone bowl, or watermelon soju on the roof, which we were fine with. However, when my friend tried to order a mango ice cream soju cocktail, she was told that wasn't allowed on the roof either (no ice cream cocktails on the roof at all). They should be more transparent about this limited rooftop menu to avoid frustrated/disappointed customers.

We were also given a shot glass that had cracks and chips in it, and I overheard this happening to the table next to us too. That's really dangerous and the servers should be more aware of things like this before it even reaches the table.

It also takes a while for servers to come around. We initially ordered drinks and asked for more time to decide on food, and our server said she would come back. She never came back LOL we were waiting for so long... we had to flag down another waiter who then became our server for the rest of the night. Not sure what happened to our initial server.

Mediocre service aside, the food is pretty decent. There's a lot of variety and everything I've tried so far tastes really good. I HIGHLY recommend the crunchy corn, cheesy corn, and sweet chili wings (not spicy at all!).

The price of the soju hurts my soul considering it's like $1/bottle in Korea and $15/bottle here but that also seems pretty standard for restaurants in this area so I can't complain too much. The ice cream / yogurt soju cocktails are fun and taste good but they cost even more, like $19?? And they don't even use an entire bottle for those cocktails. Just make that stuff on your own at home, it'll be wayyy cheaper and it's not hard to make.

Overall, this is a good place to grab a drink, eat some Korean food, and hang out. I've also celebrated some birthdays here and it's a good time. The rooftop is nice and the inside looks clean and spacious."

Not only is it open late with great drinks, but we felt really safe with the precautions they took --even putting up plastic dividers between each booth.

Our server, Eric, was one of the highlights of the visit. We notified him that it was my friend's birthday, and he instructed us through a proper soju bomb demonstration! Couldn't be happier. Definitely come check this spot out for a great, safe evening!"

I've been really cautious since the whole pandemic started- I've ordered out only a handful of times and have yet to dine in at a restaurant...until today...and I regretted it immediately.  My friends had reassured me of the covid health guidelines implemented by restaurants across the city and I've been seeing many pictures on social media, so I decided to give in. 

Given the current circumstances, you'd think bathroom maintenance would be a top priority since everyone would be in there constantly to wash their hands. Nope, not the case. There was THROW UP in every. single. stall- including the trash can!  And no toilet paper, or paper towels (hand dryers available).  Apparently it was the same situation in the men's bathroom as well.   How are they even open right now with the bathrooms in this condition during covid?  I really don't know.

We also had to dine using paper plates because they ran out of plates, but that was fine- one time use, I guess."

520,70,SOJUba,1 star rating,12/18/2021,"Arrived 30 minutes early for a large party and asked if we could be seated. Then we were told we couldn't be seated because we didn't have most of the party. We were nice about it and just asked if we could go to the bathroom while we waited. As we were walking to the bathroom, one of the hostess told us we could sit at our table, but we still went to the bathroom first. After we sat down at the table a bouncer came over to us and asked us why we were sitting. We explained what happened previously but he was giving us attitude and wasn't listening to what we had to say explaining the whole situation. Even telling us that they could only seat full parties not most of the party as we were told by one of the hostesses. Eventually, the hostess seated us came over and told him that it was her fault that she seated us so early. We were allowed to sit at the table but it honestly was just chaos and wouldn't have happened if the staff just communicated better with one another. 

The main point here is that there's poor communication between the hostesses and the bouncer which led to a bunch of employees coming up to us with attitude of why we were sitting at our table."
521,71,SOJUba,5 star rating,11/18/2019,"Food was really good here. We so much food but was able to finish everything. The corn was like kernals of a candy caramel dream. It was so good. I never knew corn could be that delicious. 

The alcohol was also really good they had many different flavors of soju.The atmosphere is like a club. I didn't know if I should be dancing or eating!"
522,72,SOJUba,1 star rating,2/15/2021,"I'd give it zero if I could. Where to start...
I brought my parents out to dinner for a visit and it was a nightmare. Server was obviously new to the trade. Brought my fiancé a 4oz glass for a can of beer when he asked for a draft. Then told him they were out and the bartender brought the second.
Another note. The restaurant was empty, and they sat a 10 top of college kids (loud, live your life, but away from my parents) right next to us so I had to yell to my dad. Over the twerk contest Korean pop music they blared. It is a Korean sports bar. And I can tell you it's not.
Ordering food. My dad was ignored. And she had to re-ask for the order. Mom was told no for add ons but fiancé was told yes, so she asked again. Next. My fiancé's fried rice came out after we were nearly finished. So I didn't eat to wait for him. The rice was over cooked. Wasn't fried. The shrimp and chicken were rubbery and overcooked. He ate two bites and sent it back.
The server refused to take it off the check and charged us for it.
She said ""it's out of my hands, he ate it""
My dad (being the polite man he was, said no to seeing the manager) and we left. Will never return. I will tell everyone, and anyone they should never try this place.
All they add is sugar. First off. Fried rice is brown sugar, not white, soy and sesame sauce."
523,73,SOJUba,5 star rating,1/30/2022,Very nice staff and the ambient is great. Drinks and food are really good. Would highly suggest it!
524,74,SOJUba,3 star rating,9/11/2019,"I have a friend who always has her birthday dinner at Sojuba. And I get it: it's a fun place for a celebration. It's like if a club decided that it wanted to be a restaurant. There's a disco ball, laser lights, and music vids with accompanying loud music (bring on the K-pop!) on multiple screens. 

You can make (large) reservations, which also lends itself well to birthday plans. There are flavored sojus & fun soju cocktails (like one with a melon popsicle in it and another in a watermelon) as well as beer towers. And if you get a birthday shot, they play a birthday song and dance it over to you! It's fun. Overpriced, for sure. And most patrons seem to be college kids, which may or may not make you feel old. But it's still fun.

The menu is large, with many (mostly Korean) offerings. The wings (soy garlic, medium, or spicy) are always popular as are apps like the scallion & kimchee pancakes. I always go for the Korean rice cakes (ddok bokghi), which come in a delish spicy sauce, and you can order them with different toppings like seafood, veggies, and fishcakes. It's a big portion for $12, and I split it with another person. The steamed pork dumplings were $8 for 6, and they lacked flavor - pass. The service was a bit disorganized for our large group. We had a number of different servers, and it was sometimes difficult to track someone down. They also took our orders at different times and brought drinks/food at different times. We also could only split our group of 25 on 4 checks, which proved to be difficult when it was time to pay.

Overall, Sojuba is a fun time if you have a fun group! Dance along to the K-pop (I love the English translations of the lyrics at the bottom - hilarious), and drink some more soju!"
525,75,SOJUba,5 star rating,5/19/2021,Living just minutes away from this place I wonder why I missed this all this while being a cocktail fan. Love love their melonba and the cheesy juicy corn side!
526,76,SOJUba,4 star rating,1/8/2020,"If you want to feel like you're in Korea, this is the bar to go. They have kpop and mainstream hiphop on blast all the time. In my opinion its like a mix between a bar lounge and a mini club. There is strobe lights and occassionally a DJ present. 

I've also tried the food here and for late night eats (open til 2AM) with the atmosphere and drinks, its not bad at all. Especially if you get the drunchies, the selection of korean food is really good such as the budae jigae or just some classis fried chicken wings. If you're feeling adverturous then the chicken gizzards are one of me and my friends favorites. Definitely one of my top places to go for a chill night out with friends."
527,77,SOJUba,5 star rating,9/25/2021,Great foods great music and perfect atmosphere!! I love Korean food and they really have great Korean Fried Chicken here and Suju are wonderful too!! I highly recommend this place!!!!!!! I'll definitely come to this place again and bring some new friends!
528,78,SOJUba,5 star rating,7/22/2019,"Probably as good as it gets. Everyone loves coming here to pregame or to hold big gatherings with their friends, and I can definitely see why. SOJUba is the spot for big groups of people because you're able to cater to so many with drinks and food. I'd recommend making a reservation or coming early if you have a large group of people, but the wait for getting a table shouldn't be too bad (30-40 minutes?)

The best part of SOJUba is the ambiance with the food. It's so fun jamming out to your favorite hits along with chowing down on delicious Korean food. I've only done family styled meals here, but the portions are big enough for 2 people to share. I love getting the budae jjgae, which is a big hot pot that has ramen, sausage, spam, rice cakes, in a spicy broth. This is probably one of their most popular dishes and it can probably cater to a good 3-4 people. Their soy garlic is pretty good, crunchy and full of flavor. The glass noodles, jjapchae, wasn't my favorite because it was too saucy for my liking but it still had the classic taste of it. Their cheese corn and their tteokbotki is pretty standard, didn't blow me away since it tastes like other restaurants. 

However, I must say that the crunchy corn is HANDS DOWN my favorite dish to get here. I love this because it's crunchy, sweet, and savory all at the same time. It can get a little messy while scooping it, so I'd recommend ordering it in a bowl. 

Soju is average price, I love the grapefruit or the strawberry. If it's anyone's birthday, the birthday shots are delicious! 3 sparkling sojus and they stop the music to turn on their cool birthday song remix. 

Again, ambiance is great to come with a large group, but it can get loud. Very casual and the service is fast and friendly. I definitely can't wait to be back!"
529,79,SOJUba,5 star rating,10/22/2021,"Great food, great drinks, great music.

Loved the atmosphere front to back. I came here with my friends looking for a good time and great food. Some places near Fenway only focus on being a sports bar.

Sojuba is lit."
530,80,SOJUba,5 star rating,10/21/2021,"I love SOJUba and their music. Great atmosphere, and the lights are cool. The skeleton is cool. The waiters are very cool. Family ties"
531,81,SOJUba,4 star rating,6/18/2020,"I've been to Sojuba at least 10 times and really no other Asian bar in Boston compares. K-Pop music plays until around 8 p.m., and then hard rap starts to blast for the rest of the night. Expect LOTS of colorful lights, loud chatter, and the occasional ""it's your birthday"" rap interruption. I love this place. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good night (just at Sojuba or before heading out to another bar/club). This is definitely for a group hangout opposed to a two-person dinner. 

Sojuba has two sections: one with typical tables for food and drinks, and another with a bar/standing room. If you're coming later at night, make sure to bring your ID--they're super strict with carding!  

I've gotten everything from soju to soju-beer to their North Korea birthday bomb shots. If you're a sweet tooth, I recommend the Melona soju cocktail. Otherwise, have a good time and order rounds of flavored soju! 

Food-wise, this place is pretty good too. Boodae Jungol is the ultimate comfort food, and the seafood scallion pancakes are worth it! If you want reasonable one-person portions, I recommend the stone bowl bibimbap. 

This place isn't five stars because the service isn't always amazing. I've had to wait 30 minutes to an hour past my reservation time on multiple occasions, and sometimes getting the waiters/waitresses' attention is tough on a busy night. My advice is to come around 9 p.m. on a Friday or Saturday and then stay for two hours; any later and you risk standing around for a long, long time."
532,82,SOJUba,5 star rating,10/10/2021,Went on a Sunday at 1 am and the manager was super accommodating. I asked for for more hype music and he was happy to turn it up. I always come here with the boys to celebrate. Honestly one of my favorite places to come. Be prepared to have a great time.

537,87,SOJUba,1 star rating,5/30/2021,"No idea why this place has such good reviews. The service is poor, we waited for three hours for our food. There are five of us and each dish takes 30 mins to an hour. By the time the first person finished his meal, there are two of us who haven't had their orders. Also, the food is meh. We were also told that there's a minimum charges of $25 per person. Ridiculous place"
538,88,SOJUba,5 star rating,9/17/2021,"Good service, food and drink. Fun vibe with friendly people. Great location with easy parking."
539,89,SOJUba,5 star rating,8/3/2019,"Fun lounge to be at with a group of friends. A fun ambience with loud music you can jam to, DJ always giving shout out to the birthday peeps. Food are surprisingly good for lounge food. Soy garlic chicken wings + drumsticks are food with the right amount of flavor and the chicken are not over fried or under fried. Seafood stir fry udon has a ton of seafood with the right flavors. Korean oysters are huge with a kick of Korean style so don't be surprised that you don't taste cocktail sauce with the oysters. Soju are decent prices. Not crazy expensive as I expected for Fenway.

Overall thoughts: great vibe and a fun lounge ambience to hang out with a group of friends (or a party of friends) while enjoying eating together the Asian family style and drinks. DJ are great at picking songs, not like some boring DJs that can't get a good vibe going for some Boston clubs or wedding receptions."
540,0,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/10/2022,"Ordered delivery.

The Chicken pho GA is awesome!  There is something about the broth thats simple yet effective.  sprouts, noodles, cilantro, chicken, scalions, thinly sliced onions, and basil come with it.  I had no idea how exactly to eat this the first time, so I used a large bowl. But the plastic container the broth comes with is just big enough to host all of it minus the noodles.  Slowly add noodles as you are eating and no need for a separate bowl.

I don't add Hoisin Sauce, since the subtle flavors of  each ingredients coupled with the broth is flavor enough.  Very soothing to eat too, especially when hot."
541,1,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/7/2022,"In 1972 ""The Bangcock"" opened on Mass Ave a few stores down from ""Pho Basil"". It lasted over 40 years, was the first Thai and absolutely best Thai restaurant in Boston and I measured every other Thai restaurant to its standard.

Pho Basil has taken over the mantle

Massaman curry has the perfect amount of cinnamon and the correct amount of heat that hits you on the aftertaste

Pad Thai noodles were also perfect - just sweet enough and the right amount of peanut flavor 

A true 5

We'll done"
542,2,Pho Basil,4 star rating,1/25/2022,"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Boston. I was introduced to this eatery while my daughter was attending college in Boston. 

Luckily  during my recent stay in Boston, my hotel was just two blocks away. I was able to place my order online, pay, and pickup- the second time around.  

Let me explain, the night previous, I ordered  for Grubhub to deliver. The driver delivered my meal to the wrong hotel. I called the restaurant to inform them of the issue and they said I had to handle it through Grubhub, therefore the 4 stars. I was refunded my money but that left me to find dinner that evening. Thank Goodness the hotel had tasty bar food. So the disaster was remedied. 

In sum, the food was just as I remembered it 10 years ago, DELICIOUS!!!"
543,3,Pho Basil,5 star rating,3/14/2022,"Came here on a Tuesday around 7pm and there wasn't a wait, which I was very surprised about because I heard this place is poppin. I got the bun bo hue which was super flavorful and the portion is decently big. The only thing was the server told me the noodles were vermicelli but when I got them they seemed different... but maybe because I specified I wanted white noodles and so they changed it? Not sure. Overall great food and great service for a great price!"
544,4,Pho Basil,4 star rating,12/29/2021,"Great ambiance! 

Real good food!

The service is good and heartfelt.

It was quite busy when I was here, both Wednesdays. First Wednesday for dine in and second Wednesday for takeout."
545,5,Pho Basil,4 star rating,10/28/2021,"This is a very solid pho place to satisfy a craving. Can it compare to the Vietnamese places I've tried in California? No. But it is a great option in the middle of the city. I would go here over Le's.

I got the bun bo hue ($12.95). The bowls are huge but they mostly contain broth. The broth was lighter than I am used to but still packed with umami. The color of the broth was deceiving because it was not spicy at all.

Like I mentioned, the bowls are full of broth so the actual noodle portion actually wasn't too big. The portion size was fair for the price, though. I was a little annoyed at the onion slices that came with my bowl because they were tough and fibrous (maybe an old/bad onion?). The noodles were supposed to come with flank steak, rare steak, and tendon, but my bowl mostly had  flank steak. There was one small piece of tendon. To be fair they give a lot of meat."
546,6,Pho Basil,5 star rating,12/28/2021,"sO GOOD. favorite thai restaurant.

i usually give pretty good reviews but this is like one of the highest ratings i will ever give

what we got:
tom yum fried rice with chicken (10000/5 yums): this was so good. so flavorful and the rice was PERFECTLY cooked. the chicken was sliced thin enough where it soaked in the flavor and it wasn't dry at all. it had a very strong basil taste and a slight kick but was SO GOOD
pad thai with tofu (10000/5 yums): at first glance, it lowkey looked unflavorful. the color isn't really a deep red or brown, more of a slight red. HOWEVER, the smell really showed the IMMACULATE flavors. it was more on the tangy side than sweet and the noodles, although looked soggy, were ACTUALLY INSANELY CHEWY. it was so good
thai iced tea (5/5 yums): less sweet but the condensed milk flavor was peeking through (usually i don't taste it) SUPER GOOd highly recommend.

now conclusion: the PORTION SIZE WAS SO HUGE LIKE OMgz. i ate so much like this would have been 3 meals for me. also the service was amazing. they gave us serving spoons and extra plates. honestly just amazing."
547,7,Pho Basil,4 star rating,8/3/2021,"Service, portion sizes: 5/5
Noodles, toppings: 4/5
Broth: 3.5/5

We came here for lunch on a Sunday and it was decently busy, mostly with people getting the lunch specials. We got the Pho Tai and Bun bo hue. The pho was okay but nothing special -- the noodles were plentiful and the steak was decent, but the broth didn't have much depth of flavor. The bun bo hue was better -- the meat was super tender and the broth had a bit more flavor, and the noodles seemed a bit overcooked/sticking together but still good.

The service was great and the portion sizes were super plentiful, but the broth wasn't so great."
548,8,Pho Basil,3 star rating,5/27/2021,"Look this place used to be great, cheap and well cared for food. I'm a regular here who has gone at least once a month for a few years now. But unfortunately it has gone downhill due to Covid and the influx of people. Don't get me wrong this place used to be a clear Five Stars no doubt. For under $20 a person with over 20% tip you could grab a really quality meal. 

Last year and even through much of Covid they had good bits of quality beef in the beef pho's and they were cut into bite sized pieces. Well portioned with really quality pho. However in the last 3-4 months the beef and meats included have become increasingly fatty with each visit and they have stopped chopping them into bites. Now the meat is in these absurdly large and in thick variations that are impossible to reasonably eat with chop sticks. Not only that but it is stretchy and chewy. 

I loved this place and wish it could go back to that, but I think corners have begun to be cut, prices have increased, and the new business model is coming to your table once when you order and then turning the table over as fast as possible to account for the others waiting outside. 

There's no reservations and you simply show up and hope the line is short enough. The man who runs front of house is very nice but understandably overworked. Just not the same place as it once was."
549,9,Pho Basil,5 star rating,3/16/2022,"I've overlooked this place over the years because it's tucked away in a very student-y part of town... so I mistakenly assumed it was of moderate quality. Recently, I popped in on the spur of the moment and discovered that the food was fantastic! Genuinely spicy, lighter than I'd expected and just overall wonderful. The service was fast and hospitable. I've now eaten here several weeks in a row, haha."
550,10,Pho Basil,5 star rating,1/24/2022,"Got takeout from here on Saturday evening, via call in order.

Food: 5/5
We started with the pork/chicken gyoza, which were fine but nothing amazing. We also got 2 Pho Rau Cai, which is outstanding. Great flavors, good variety of veggies. We recommend it over the other veggie pho (Pho Chay, has a sweeter broth). Lastly, we got an order of the Pad See Ew w/chicken, which is really good. Some of the best we've tried around Boston.

Service: 5/5
Food was ready on time and hot. Great value."
551,11,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/10/2022,Maybe my favorite restaurant in Boston. I go here every week. Great food. Great service. I recommend the chicken fried rice.
552,12,Pho Basil,2 star rating,11/7/2021,"We were looking for a place to eat pho, but once it became apparent any place worth eating at was going to require a long wait, we decided to do take out. There was a line out the door. Surely this must be a great place. Google says it's good for take out, but they apparently don't have take out containers for eating pho...so we ordered the Thai Fried Rice and Pad Thai instead. We then ordered pho from Saigon Fusion a few stores down which had convenient take-out bowls.

When we got to our hotel room we were very disappointed with the smell and taste of the pad thai. Everything about it was off...borderline offputting. We strongly considered just tossing it. The fried rice was not as bad but was very bland. We put them both in the fridge thinking they would taste better when we're were hungrier or taste worse to justify throwing it away. We had food from the place next door to hold us over. Incidentally, the sharp vinegary smell and taste had mellowed out the next day when we reheated it."
553,13,Pho Basil,2 star rating,1/11/2022,Takeout pad Thai was only noodles  I was very disappointed and wish there was more variety in my order.
554,14,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/20/2021,"This was my go-to Thai food place when I was living in the city. I have yet to find any place that makes a better gra pow fried rice, and I almost always get that (with ground chicken) and a Thai tea when I eat here. The one entree alone always gave me another 1 to 2 more meals!

Service has always been friendly and relatively fast despite there always being a line at dinner time (pre-COVID). It's a small-ish place but well worth the wait, or takeout is another good option. I don't think I've ever been disappointed with anything I've tried here."
555,15,Pho Basil,3 star rating,1/8/2022,"We've ordered delivery from here a few times. Delivery was pretty quick and all food was hot and fresh. 

I always get the Pho Ga noodle soup (chicken) and the hubs has gotten the Pho Tai (steak) and also the Bo Vien (meatball) soup. Love the Pho and all the fixings. Broths are flavorful and herbs (basil, cilantro) are always fresh, good portion size. I always have enough leftover for a lunch soup too. Only thing the chicken is sometimes dry and yesterday it was really chewy that's why only 3 stars. Hubs found his soup overall warm and satisfying but the meatballs were not as amazing - kind of rubbery according to him. Gyoza (steamed) was ok.

Roti n curry dip was nice with a really tasty rich spicy sauce to dip the pancake in. Pad see yu (with tofu) was good and so was the Com Chien (vietnamese fried rice) with chicken.

Overall food is good, maybe a bit pricey but they are in Back Bay so that's probably why. The restaurant seems busy especially with the students around and glad they've stayed open."
556,16,Pho Basil,4 star rating,12/26/2021,"If you are craving pho on Mass Ave, this is the place to go. 

Food I've tried:
- DAC BIET PHO ($12): the meat was prepared well, and not tough at all. The broth itself was not overly salty, and had the hearty umami flavors I expect from a good bowl of pho. Portion and price was very reasonable as well. 

Atmosphere:
- The store is on the smaller side. Especially during peak hours, there is always a line out the door for this place. 

Service:
- The staff are friendly and we got our food relatively quick.

Overall:
- It is a solid place to go for pho, for a good price and a very convenient location. I personally prefer Le's still as my favorite pho in Boston, as I think their broth is more refreshing."
557,17,Pho Basil,5 star rating,9/3/2021,"Food taste 4.5/5
portion 5/5 (I feel their delivery boxes are def bigger than other restaurants)
Ubereats packaging 5/5
I ordered this place for ubereats. First of all, wow best packaging ever! They put cardboard in between food to seperate them. Very stable and nothing got spilled. 
I ordered:
Saigon noodle: its more like Pad see ew with a vietamnese name. plus a little bit spicy but not as spicy as drunken noodle. The noodle cooked to the perfect texture and the flavor (sweet salty and spicy) is very food. The only downside is that the chicken is a little bit dry. and there were too few egg pieces in it. but the portion was huge. 
Mi Hoanh Than: traditional pho with three pieces of wonton (another version of dumplings). The lettuce etc, soup, and the noodles came in three seperated containers. I put them together and added the hoisin sauce package included, which make the soup more flavorful. The noodle tasted good, but I have to admit I'm never a fan of pho since the taste is kinda blanc... But my friend loved the noodle soup. 
Spicy tofu eggplant: this is my favorite. The flavor is sooo good and its medium spicy level. I wish there were more eggplant pieces in it. I loved the steam rice it came with! It's not the typical rice you get from other restaurant. It's so soft and have a very special aroma.
Def will come back again to try other dishes."

I ordered the tai pho, since I'm not a fan of tripe or tendon. The broth was very savory and flavorful! I added a drizzle of hoisin sauce, and it tasted delicious! I was disappointed by the amount of meat that was in the soup. 

I also felt that the waitress was really rushing us/pushing us to leave when we hadn't even been sitting there for long. 

Overall, we had a decent experience, but we will probably go elsewhere for our next pho craving."
561,21,Pho Basil,4 star rating,2/2/2021,"I came in here on Feb 2 2021. They have excellent anti COVID measure in place. Hand sanitizer, large distances between tables, QR menu, and the hot sauce is only served when requested.

The place was quite busy and the server decided to attend our table after taking orders from another table that came after us. This was factored into rating.

I ordered Tai; the seven pieces of beef that came with it were disappointing, very rough and felt old. Bean sprouts were great but they served too little for my preference but by a little. The broth and noodles made up for the dish. I was pretty satisfied as a consequence.

I would come back again happily. I am not convinced this is the best Boston Pho place but it is a pretty good choice."

563,23,Pho Basil,2 star rating,8/17/2021,"I am sorry, but I have to write a bad review for this place.  

Our table of three, no one liked their meal.  We got bun bo hue.  I asked what the waitress thought of the bun bo hue and asked if it was ""really"" good.  She was super excited and told us yes.  It was not good.  There was no depth in flavor to the broth.  It should have been more beefy more lemongrass and there was hardly any spice.  

Another coworker got tai pho and requested vegetables to go with it.  The soup came but the vegetables took an additional 15 minutes.  ""Sorry we are busy"" was their response.  

What did I learn today?  The best thing on the menu was the fried spring roll."
564,24,Pho Basil,4 star rating,11/30/2021,Move away from pad Thai and order Kai soi! It's only of my favorite dishes to get at a Thai restaurant. Not all places will have this dish so I get excited when I do see it in the menu.
565,25,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/15/2022,Every time. EVERY TIME. Everything is good. Pho. Com Chien. Thai curry. Can't go wrong. Biggest problem is the wait.
566,26,Pho Basil,1 star rating,2/20/2022,"I just left and did enjoy the pho until I went to the bathroom and saw a rat. Mind you the waitress had just cleaned the bathroom, I know I was the next  in . I informed them of what I saw and no one cared...it was like a typically day with a rat. DONT EAT HERE!"
567,27,Pho Basil,4 star rating,8/13/2021,"Came here tonight to try out this place. Very happy we did. The service was efficient, attentive and really good despite the place being very busy and will a lot of takeout orders too. 
Food was good too, the Com Heo (grill pork with lemongrass and spices over rice) was really nice. The broth for the Dac Biet was nicely sweet ( savory sweet, Not sugary sweet) .
I would recommend this place and we will definitely revisit the next time we are in Boston"
568,28,Pho Basil,1 star rating,10/21/2021,"I ordered food to go and when I got home I lifted the bag out of my car and the whole bag just fell apart. I called and tried to explain that something was leaking and caused the bag to rip. But I was told that the bag was perfect when they gave it to me and that it was my fault. 

I guess I will have to eat the food from ground to give a good review."
569,29,Pho Basil,5 star rating,12/6/2021,"BEST PHO PLACE I've been to in Boston! The broth is extremely flavorful and the serving size is perfect. It's a nice large bowl with plenty of noodles and broth. The broth was so flavorful enough, you don't even need to add sriracha (unless you want a kick) and hoisin sauce. I got the bo vien pho (meatball) 10/10 delicious. The place is small and there is often a line during peak dining hours (lunch, dinner time). I was lucky and came a bit early on a weekday (Monday) but a line formed shortly after I sat down. That's how you know the place is good - people are willing to wait forever!"
570,30,Pho Basil,5 star rating,9/8/2021,"I've been looking for a good Asian restaurant (that's not ramen) around back bay and heard great things about this place. Walking in, I loved the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant; it felt both comfy and modern. The waiters were super nice and service was great.

Pho 7/10 - The pho broth here is pretty good; it's a deep and hearty soup. I've tried better broths that had richer flavors, but this soup was decent enough. The noodles and meat was also good.

Kao Soi 9/10 - I really liked the broth they used for this noodle soup. It was a sweet and creamy curry. I also loved the noodles they used which were thin yellow noodles. The noodles were able to soak up a lot of the curry which made it taste very flavorful. The duck was also very moist, but since it's been wicked in the curry, the skin wasn't crunchy.

Pad Thai with duck 8.5/10 - The flavor of this pad Thai was on point and it tasted amazing with the duck. I didn't like how short the noodles were. They had cut up the noodles so that they were only about 1-2 inches long. I wish they just left the noodles long instead of chopping it all up.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone living nearby and craving some Vietnamese/Thai food. The portions are big and you will leave very full and satisfied."
571,31,Pho Basil,5 star rating,11/23/2021,"Love this place whenever I'm craving something warm and soothing.

My go to is the bun bo hue which is a slightly spicy beef noodle soup. The meat is plentiful and tender. The broth is very aromatic but not as spicy as it looks. 

Their pho is also really great and hits the spot on a cold Boston day. Bowls are large and you'll leave feeling satisfied. The broth isn't as flavorful as the bunbohue but it'll satisfy a craving for pho. 

Service is great! Expect a wait though, they do not take reservations."
572,32,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/5/2022,Excellent first visit !  Food was fantastic. We will definitely be back soon to try other dishes. Great menu choices !
573,33,Pho Basil,3 star rating,5/26/2021,"We visited Pho Basil one evening when we were visiting Boston. The restaurant is small but spacious - with covid, menus are obtained w a QR code link and there is hand sanitizer located for use right at the entrance. 

There is a large menu here with a huge selection of food. Overall however, I felt like the flavors were okay - not anything super special. Hours after the meal, I was extremely thirsty which led me to the conclusion that there was a lot of MSG in the food. The amount may have been more than what I typically see as I was consuming multiple bottles of water which isn't very characteristic of me."
574,34,Pho Basil,2 star rating,12/9/2021,"No bueno for delivery. 
They did not pay attention to the instructions and as a result the food sat at the front desk for about an hour. 
Greasy Roti. Just ok Pho. 

Yelp please let your customers know Ben the food has been delivered ( like other deliver services that provide real-time updates) .  

Disappointing."
575,35,Pho Basil,4 star rating,4/3/2021,"Duck Green Curry was my favorite. The duck had no gamy taste. The skin was crispy and curry itself was super flavorful.

Chicken Satay had a strong peanut smell. With the peanut sauce on the side, the dish was strong and juicy. Loved it!

The pho and rice noodles were kind of bland and were just fine."
576,36,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/2/2021,"My go-to Thai place!  Amazing prices & quality- this a great place in Mass Ave to go to.  

I've tried a couple types of pho, curry, fried rice, and noodles & they are all amazing.  I really like all the lunch specials in particular, as they are really cheap and still amazing (with pretty huge portions).  My favorite lunch special is the drunken noodles as they are very flavorful.

Definitely try this place out!!!"
577,37,Pho Basil,5 star rating,3/7/2022,I don't care what anyone else in this Yelp chain has to say. This is literally the best Thai food in Boston and maybe that I've ever had. SO GOOD. Get the spicy crab Rangoon or the sesame wings to start. The red chicken curry is also amazing. Those are my go to.
578,38,Pho Basil,5 star rating,3/5/2022,"This restaurant is in high demand! I'd highly recommend it to any foodie in the mood for a light and trendy atmosphere with authentic Vietnamese cuisine. The menu is shockingly affordable, as many college students come through the area. They don't take reservations, and they can get super busy, so Id plan to come in a smaller party. The Dac Biet Pho and crunchy egg rolls are 11/10!"
579,39,Pho Basil,4 star rating,11/12/2021,"As far as I can tell, you're in for a wait - we arrived around 5:30 pm on a Tuesday and got a table quickly, but the line was well out the door by the time we finished. 

Pho was pretty good, and nicely priced, so I have few complaints. That said, I've had better broth in other places."
580,40,Pho Basil,5 star rating,12/18/2021,"this place always has such lines from the minute they open to the minute they close for a valid reason! the food here is not only affordable, but really tasty as well.
-you can order for pickup through the phone, and usually, the food should be ready in ~20 minutes depending on how busy they are. you can also make reservations in advance by calling them, except for fridays and saturdays.
-the service here is relatively quick. while the wait can be quite long for a table, the food comes out in 10-15 minutes after you order. so, chances are you can be in and out in 30 minutes once you're seated. 
-i only ever paid in cash during my visits, but i think they accept card payments too.

10/10/21
-dac biet pho: this is probably the most popular pho option on their menu; the beef noodle soup has rare steak, well done flank, tendon, tripe, onions, and scallions. on the side, you also get some mint and bean sprouts to add to your liking. the flavor of the broth really rich and just the right amount of fattiness. there's a fair amount of meat compared to noodles, but i did feel like some cuts of the meat weren't as tender/chewy as i would like. nevertheless, it's a solid choice that'll definitely satisfy your pho craving on any day. not to mention, the portion is quite generous for only $12 not including tax. (4/5)

11/21/21
-chicken pad thai: the hype for this place's pad thai is 100% reasonable. although you'd think that this place specializes more in pho, their pad thai is surprisingly so good. i've gotten it twice, once as takeout and once while dining at the restaurant. i'll admit that the taste is better if you don't opt for takeout, but that's probably unavoidable. you have a choice of protein, such as shrimp, crisky duck, chicken, beef, tofu, etc, which will affect the price of the dish. i got chicken in my pad thai both times, and the portion of it was just the right amount. the noodles also have egg, bean sprouts, scallions,  ground peanuts, and a lime wedge. the best part is the sauce that they used to stir fry the noodles; it has just the amount of peanut flavor, without making it too overpowering. however, they tend to use a lot of oil, which makes the portion even more filling. one order is easily shareable between 2 people, since there's a ton of noodles. normally the price is around $13, not including tax, for the chicken pad thai. however, i'd suggest that you order this during their lunch hour special hours, since the cost drops to around $11 with tax for the same portion. nevertheless, the price is worth the amount that they give, and i'd undoubtedly order it again in the future. (5/5)

overall, even though i wanted to give this place 4.5 stars out of 5, the prices just really can't be beaten. the portions are huge and there's little to no chance you'll be leaving hungry after eating here haha. although i'm not sure how often i'd come back, every experience i've had has been great. i'd highly recommend that you must try their chicken pad thai!"
581,41,Pho Basil,5 star rating,12/18/2021,This place still SLAPS!!!!! Since opening it has literally never let me down. Hands down the best restaurant in Boston. I love this place.
582,42,Pho Basil,3 star rating,2/2/2022,"Greetings, I am on a journey to find the yummiest pad thai in the United States. My journey today has brought me to Pho basil. I got back from the airport and was desperately craving some pad thai. I was in a blind hangry rage as I ordered vegetarian pad thai, my usual, from Pho Basil. My doordash driver promptly delivered the pad thai (smart). I immediately dug in. The sauce/noodle flavor was ~stupendous~ but I took issue with the random veggies- red pepper and green beans? so random. also they were kind of stale and the green beans looked like they came from the can. broccoli was sort of brown. but overall the dish was yummies. Not the best pad thai i've ever had, but would probably order again after traveling. My journey continues. Accepting recommendations (would love some in the Boston area!)"
583,43,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/17/2022,One of the best affordable restaurants in Boston. As a college student I go here all the time. Friendly service and their Tom Yum fried rice with fried chicken is to die for. Their Thai tea is also so so flavorful.
584,44,Pho Basil,4 star rating,12/20/2021,"I enjoy food there yet it's always crowded. My favorite is pho sate. All in all, I would suggest this place, quite authentic."

Overall good thai food.
I would like to go gain and again"
586,46,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/6/2022,Omg was driving down Newbury st starving for some Pho and noodles. Looked on Yelp and found pho basil with lots of good reviews and decided to order duck noodle soup . Delicious!!! Also ordered pad see you. Omg beyond delicious.was a bit messy eating In The car as we don't eat in restaurants re Covid . But it was worth every slurp on my jeans and middle console . Definitely would recommend and will come back again next time I drive into town to shop!
587,47,Pho Basil,3 star rating,11/30/2020,"I did take out from here - they have both Vietnamese food and Thai food. I usually don't like to order from places that serve 2 different cuisines, but they managed to pull off both Thai food and Vietnamese food well. 
I got the goi coun (fresh spring roll)- this was so so. The rice skin was a little too thick for my liking. 
The pho came with a container of soup, noodles and raw beef in another container, and vegetables in another container. This is smart so that your noodles do not get soggy in the soup. The only thing I did not like was the fact that the raw beef was in the same bag as the noodles, it did not feel hygienic! I quickly threw the raw beef and noodles into the broth in hope of cooking it and killing off any germs. If you do take out for pho, you might want to request to have the raw beef packed separately in its own container. 
The drunken noodles were very spicy but delicious as well. The portion size was extremely generous! 
Overall, delicious food and good portion sizes."
588,48,Pho Basil,2 star rating,6/30/2021,"I ordered the pad Thai and green curry. The pad Thai was ok, something was missing in terms of flavor, it was to some extend tomatoey.  The green curry was in my opinion the worst curry I've ever eaten. The chicken tasted like it was boiled in unseasoned water and then tossed in the super spicy unflavored coconut milk at the end. It didn't absorb any of the curry flavor whatsoever, I couldn't get the horrendous taste out of my mouth fast enough. The rice was so over cooked that I just put it in the trash. Pretty much a total waste of money. I hate wasting food and that's exactly what I did tonight. I was even disappointed in the Thai tea... even when the food is just ok, the Thai tea is always good. I don't know how this place has 4 stars. 

I've had authentic Thai food in Thailand and this is the third place I've eaten Thai food in Boston and is just so disappointing. I guess my quest continues...."
589,49,Pho Basil,3 star rating,11/30/2020,"The pad thai was $15 and not very good
The crispy chicken was good - but not $15 food

The crab rangoon cost $7 for 5 tiny pieces but it was extremely tasty. 

My husband's bun thit nuong was really not that good either. 

All made worse by the fact that the original time of arrival by Grub Hub was 1:25 to 1:40 but arrived around 2:30. So compounded by the fact that it was late, it was overpriced and not that great."
590,50,Pho Basil,5 star rating,5/25/2021,"This place for me, might not be the best for food of all (don't get me wrong, food is still great), however; the service - Wow! Couldn't have asked for a better waitress!

I dined in with my husband yesterday - Monday, our server, Nan, greeted us very nicely let alone her being super busy!

This is not my first time, but my first time with the new menu, a lot of dishes that I've tried and like were removed from the menu, so I asked for a little help from our server. Not only she was knowledgeable about the menu, her recommendations are phenomenal! 

Even though the restaurant was really packed and busy, Nan would always come and check up on us, the food were great! The service was fantastic! Will definitely come back many many more times xxx

I've never left any reviews anywhere, but the experience yesterday deserves 10 stars if I could give that much!"
591,51,Pho Basil,4 star rating,10/23/2020,"Finally found a spot in Boston that does both pho and Thai food right! The menu is huge with tons of options even for vegans, vegetarians and gluten-free eaters. 
We went for lunch and it was busy but the tables are set apart based on social distancing guidelines and service was quick! 
They even have boba tea! We got the edamame gyoza and it was the best edamame gyoza I ever had! 
Will def be back to try the Kao soi!"
592,52,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/12/2021,Omg love this place. Drunken noodles is spicy and delicious. Pad see ew is like drunken noodles except not spicy at all more sweet. Highly recommend the Vietnamese ice coffee and Thai tea!
593,53,Pho Basil,4 star rating,3/11/2021,"Was craving some Vietnamese food so headed over to Pho Basil. We got the grilled pork with rice (Com Heo) and the Pho Dac Biet. The grilled pork over rice was pretty good. The pork was juicy and had a nice char. They gave a big portion of rice and some veggies on the side as well as nuoc mam sauce. The pho was also very good and came with a variety of tripe, tendon and well done frank. Did wish there was a bit more of the meats though. Overall the taste was really good and they separated the noodles and the broth so that the noodles wouldn't get soggy. Their pricing is pretty reasonable for the Boston area. This place is a great spot for some comforting viet food."
594,54,Pho Basil,4 star rating,1/18/2020,"I enjoyed dining at Pho Basil a while ago and recently ordered takeout, which came right on time despite being a massive group order. The boxes were helpfully labeled and the cartons that had liquid were bagged to prevent mess. (The one unfortunate thing was that there were no utensils, but luckily we had them.) I tried the tofu massaman curry and beef drunken noodles. The flavors of the dishes were really good, and there was a satisfying amount of food. (The rice was really packed into the takeout box, and there were lots of noodles.) I also liked the way the tofu and beef were cooked, and there were plenty of yummy vegetables!

The only drawbacks were that the noodles were chopped to a short length rather being the normal long rice noodles, which are more pleasing to eat, and the curry was a little on the milky side and could've used more spices/flavor. I would still definitely recommend Pho Basil as a solid Thai place and will likely return in the future!"
595,55,Pho Basil,1 star rating,12/19/2019,"I've been ordering here for several years now, if you look at my last review this has always been one of my favorite places and I order from them at least once per month. 

Though when they stopped their own delivery and started delivering with ubereats and other apps, their service has gotten really bad. 

They almost rarely include any sauces now, ignoring any notes placed on the app - I even sometimes call after I place my order and still they continue ignore any requests - and today for the first time I was given beyond dirty utensils and hair inside the basil bag!!! 

And to be honest, I'm not going to bother calling them because their servers are beyond rude. They were always rude, I mainly went here for the food and didn't care for the service though now even that quality has gone down and I have no reason to be back here."
596,56,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/2/2021,One of bestt Vietnamese Pho vegetarian version I have had till date! Quantity and the taste was amazing. Very authentic and recommended for vegetarians too
597,57,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/6/2021,"Pho Basil? Officially one of my favorites in Boston! 

I'm extremely picky when it comes to Vietnamese food. My mom is sometimes too busy to cook so I have to resort somewhere else to satisfy my cravings. I came across this restaurant through Yelp and let me tell you, I am SO glad I had the chance to visit! 

Upon walking in, my boyfriend and I were instantly greeted by employees. Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming. The restaurant is spacious, the tables were set 6 feet apart, and there were hand sanitizers to use right when you come in. We felt safe the entire time. 

I ended up ordering bun thit nuong (vermicelli noodles with grilled pork) and a side of crispy egg rolls. Whereas my boyfriend ordered com suon (rice with grilled lemongrass pork chops). It took approximately 15 minutes for everything to come out. The food smelled and tasted amazing! The flavors were perfect and the portions were big. Our highlight of the day was definitely the service. Our waitress frequently checked up on us and constantly refilled our drinks which were highly appreciated. 

Hands down, the best!"
598,58,Pho Basil,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"What a pleasant surprise Pho Basil was. We dined on a Friday night and the joint was jumping. We ordered the Drunken Noodles, Crispy Chicken, and Pad Thai. The food was excellent and had a complexity of spices that you would expect at a high-end dining establishment. They were expertly prepared and quite boozy. 
Excellent place and comfortable to dine in. Pleasant atmosphere with great service. Can't wait to go back here."

My girlfriends favorite pho place! It was a cold Halloween evening so pho was perfect for our weekly date! We were seated quickly and noticed that there were far fewer tables than pre covid times which makes sense. Tables were spaced pretty far from each other. Service was fast and good so no complaints there! Pho was great as well! I almost always get the beef pho with like everything in it and this one really hit! Definitely going to be one of our go tos when we don't know where to go!"
600,60,Pho Basil,5 star rating,2/13/2020,"My number 1 restaurant in my college days. Location is great, easily walkable from the Northeastern campus and close to Back Bay. The wait grows pretty fast during peak dinner hours, especially on Fridays and Saturdays.

This is the best bang for your buck, Thai food that I've ever had. I've come here over at least 100 times by now.

The main dishes I would recommend are the pad thai or pad seew with crispy chicken, pho dac biet. The noodles are super delicious and the portion sizes are huge. The crispy chicken is very juicy and crispy. The pho dac biet has one of the best pho broths I've ever tasted. It also comes with a generous amount of meat and noodles. Either of these won't disappoint!

If your in Boston and your ever feeling authentic Thai food, this is the spot.

Also get the thai iced tea. It's a great addition to your meal."
601,61,Pho Basil,5 star rating,7/16/2020,"I love getting take-out from here as I always have a reliably good experience: the food is delicious, orders are ready quickly, and staff is friendly. I usually order through UberEats and I've never had any mistakes in my orders.

I love noodles in general, and my favorites from this restaurant are duck noodle soup (excellent soup flavoring and duck meat texture) and Pad See You (very delicious, not too oily like some other places I've had this dish at). I'm not usually a huge fan of rice dishes, but I do like a couple of them here: the Com Chien fried rice is my go-to if I've been having noodles too much lately, and I've also enjoyed the Com Heo rice plate as the pork is especially juicy. Pho is always a safe option as well; my boyfriend always gets pho tai.

I discovered this place after the pandemic started so I haven't yet dined in, but I've seen a few customers dining in since the recent reopening allowed it, and they all look very happy. When I feel safe and comfortable enough to do so, this is one of the first places I would love to dine in at!"
602,62,Pho Basil,1 star rating,7/12/2021,"The food is not bad. If you are looking for good service, DO NOT GO to Pho Basil. I would give negative stars to the waitress alone if I could. This young woman was extremely rude to me and my 50+ year old parents. She told my mother to go read the menu after we asked a question, and later banged a full glass of mango latte against our table, spilling it to places and onto my father, then immediately left without saying a word. 

Feel free to continue reading about the whole thing. It went like this:

My mom is not fluent in English. I started asking on behalf of mom: Could u change the meat (Chicken, for example) to duck in stir-fry Noodles?
""You need to give me the name of the dish"".
Me checking again if we could have duck meat before ordering one
""Yes, (She interrupted with a rushing tone) YeS I AlReAdY SaId SO bUt you need to GIVE me the NAME"".
I give her the name of a dish, Saigon Noodle, then ask if they have seafood with rice.
""(Impolitely and immediately)No"".
My mom pointed at two pictures, I helped her ask: What are the differences between the two dishes? 
""You need to look at the menu, everything says there"".
She could clearly tell that my mom is not a fluent English speaker. I looked at her in the eye with a smile: so you don't want to explain?
""(answered quickly)You weren't nice to me either"".
Wait. Excuse me?... This whole time, she pulled an unhappy and impatient face. She literally had one job as a waitress, and she couldn't serve her guests. She came back later, banged a full glass of mango latte onto the corner of our table, spilling the drink onto my father and everywhere else, and immediately went away. It felt like she was expressing her feelings by doing that.
When the boss of the restaurant passed us a dish, I asked if we could have a different waitress to serve us the rest of the time. The boss said yes, and I could tell that the boss felt awkward (and a bit sorry). The boss and the second waitress (taller with glasses on) were polite. The food wasn't bad, but clearly, we didn't have a good experience.
We even asked ourselves, did we do something that made the first waitress unhappy? (Notice that we were guests, and she was serving us) All we could think of was when we walked in, we had fries and a drink in our hands, and we ate a couple of fries. She came to tell us that we can't have food from outside. I briefly explained to my mom, and we moved the food away. My dad politely asked if she could come back later and give us a few more minutes to look at the menu. When we were ordering after she came back, I can guarantee that we weren't being rude to her, tho we didn't have much joy on our faces. Maybe she had a bad day, maybe the restaurant was busy, for whatever reason, she let out her negativity and ruined our good time. Good luck with her future life and career. I used to have a good impression of this place, and I was okay with the portion and price, too. Too bad, starting today my impression is changed.

Only got the chance to try the bon bue hue. OMG.... OH MAHHH GAWDD. Zee BALLS. were amazing. YES, AMAZING BALLS! Don't even! the noods was cooked to perfection, the broth was savory and warmed up my body quick! Great for winter time! Heck, I'd probably come in the summer too! Who am i Kidding. The combinations of beef tendon, beef brisket, just ..EVERYTHING! It's CRACK TO ME! & wished I had more ! Sadly I'm back to NYC and I shall dream about their noms!

Prices are good and service is outstanding."
606,66,Pho Basil,4 star rating,11/17/2019,"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in Boston! The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 stars is due to the inconsistent service and sometimes the food but it's not too terrible to the point where I would never go back.

Highly recommend that if you're planning to come on the weekend for dinner (including Friday), go early! Like 5:00-5:30 early. Because the place is somewhat small and there's no waiting area so you could be waiting outside in the cold standing around for 30+ minutes before your table is ready. 

The best things here in my opinion are the drunken noodle, the masaman curry, the Thai basil fried rice, Penang curry, and now my new favorite is the Kao Soi soup, which is a curry soup with crispy chicken, egg noodles, pickled vegetables, and topped with crispy fried egg noodles. It made me feel somewhat bloated after but it was very flavorful! 

Overall, there's so many dishes to try. Whether you're in the mood for soup or for Thai food, pho basil will not disappoint!"
607,67,Pho Basil,3 star rating,9/24/2021,"The price is cheap for back Bay Area, but the portion was probably the smallest I've seen at a Thai restaurant so far. I ordered drunken noodles with chicken and the sauce was a little bland and wasn't well incorporated into the noodles. However, my friend got the pho ga and really liked it so maybe stick with the Vietnamese food!"
608,68,Pho Basil,2 star rating,6/6/2021,"Very disappointed that they changed the menu! No more summer rolls, vermicelli noodle bowls (""bun"" in Vietnamese), and other refreshing items that would have been perfect for the summer.

PLEASE BRING BACK THE SUMMER ROLLS AND THE VERMICELLIS BOWLS!!!"
609,69,Pho Basil,4 star rating,10/18/2020,"Every time I go to Pho Basil there are quite a number of people in the restaurant which reflects its popularity. Last time I went there was a 10 minute wait time. Inside the restaurant is very clean but can be a little noisy because of the small space, however it is not a big deal. The staff was incredibly kind and welcoming as usual, and they filled up water cups very quickly. 

I have only tried noodles from Pho Basil, and I highly recommend their Pad See Ew and Drunken Noodles. My other friend had their Pad Thai, but that dish is honestly not their best as the noodles seem to be lacking. There is a bit more flavor with the Drunken Noodles in my opinion which is why I prefer it, but I love the Pad See Ew with a spice level of 3 -- I think the amount is perfect with just the right amount to complement the dish without overpowering the flavors presented. The vegetables seem fresh and I find myself enjoying the different textures together with the noodles.Furthermore, the portion sizes of the noodles are very big and I always take a to go box with me. 

One thing I do not recommend is their bubble teas, and for that reason I took off a star. The tapioca pearls were too overdone and were rather mushy than chewy. It is apparent that they just blend it with powder which I do not like, and couldn't taste the tea in both the milk tea or the thai tea. The bubble teas really did not have much flavor, and the thai tea kind of tasted like melted cotton candy dippin' dots. I was disappointed. 

Besides the bubble teas however, the food is excellent for the price point and their customer service is very good. I will continue to visit Pho Basil."
610,70,Pho Basil,1 star rating,5/17/2021,"First time visiting because the high rating, new in town, however, very disappointed. The food is good, but not good enough for the rude service. The waitress with the long pony til was extremely rude and disrespectful, we waited long time after we got sit down, but no one seems to notice and come and give us even water. Then we finally see this girl came behind us and clean the table, I try to tell her nicely that we are ready whenever someone can tell her order, then she stare at me with this angry look and rudely tell me that Can you wait. Wow, unbelievable, I also worked in restaurants business for over 15 years, i don't think this type of altitude is right to treat your customers. Not a recommendation if you're someone who want a good meal under good environment."
611,71,Pho Basil,5 star rating,7/27/2020,"Delicious as always! Friendly, fast and clean. All the tables are 6+ feet apart. My husband and I used to wait in line for a table prior to Covid-19. Today, we are the only two people sitting inside the restaurant. It is 7:30pm, prime time for dinner. 

They have a consistent flow to people coming for takeout, but it wasn't as busy as it used to be. 

Come and support your local business!"
612,72,Pho Basil,1 star rating,9/18/2021,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE time in this restaurant!!! The waitress told us that we need to wait for 30 minutes to be seated. But actually we waited for like 50 minutes. The table is extremely small. It's a table for two but there is no enough room for two plates or two bowls. It's very hard and uncomfortable to eat by such a tiny table. The portion of pho is big but it's almost flavorless. Not tasty at all. The waitress are very good at ignoring customers. You'll have to wait for a very long time and ask several times before you get any help. After an extremely long time of waiting, we just got some food which is not delicious at all and some service which is not nice at all. A very unpleasant time here and I'll never come again."
613,73,Pho Basil,4 star rating,3/14/2021,"A classic Asian place that serves a variety of Asian cuisine. Highly recommend their Thai offering and their Drunken Noodles are a must-try.
Amazing food for the price they charge!"
614,74,Pho Basil,4 star rating,2/7/2021,"Pho Basil is a staple restaurant for me and many of my friends whenever we're craving pho or thai food. Their food never disappoints, with some of my favorites being the pho dac biet, gra pow fried rice, and drunken noodles. Before covid, they were always packed and I would usually need to wait at least 10 minutes to find a seat, which is a testament to how good their food is. Staff is pretty friendly and service is very satisfactory as well."
615,75,Pho Basil,5 star rating,8/21/2021,I love the pho broth here and haven't gotten much else here. Very solid portion sizes
616,76,Pho Basil,3 star rating,5/3/2021,Acceptable asian option for the area. The menu is a mix of vietnamese and thai.  The pad graprow is okaaaay but not the best.  Its a little too salty and fish-saucy but the portion was sizable. The chicken satay is decent and the dumplings are good.  The service was very good and the place seems very popular.  I would go again and try other things.
617,77,Pho Basil,5 star rating,9/22/2021,"If I could give Pho basil 1 million stars I would!!! I love this place so much and only have nice things to say when mentioning the restaurant. I always get Pho Tai which is 100/10 amazing :) Workers are beyond nice and care very much about their customers. My go to place for comfort food!! The only thing is the black ""privacy screen"" by the window table is quite revealing to people walking on the sidewalk and not quite high enough, where they can see you eating. I'd like to recommend something more opaque(see image below)"
618,78,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/18/2020,"I have been living out of the hospital with my 6 month old baby and with the limited hours in the hospital cafeteria or limited selections I have been having to order delivery several times a week (sometimes several times a day).  Yes, it gets expensive but there is no way to cook or store food here.  So, I have ordered a lot of different foods from surrounding restaurants on UberEats.   This is the first time I have been so wowed I am taking the time out to write a Yelp review.  

Today, I ordered the Dac Biet with extra meat and hot chili oil on the side if possible.  They gave me an extra order of eggrolls and put the hot chili oil on the side as requested but omitted the sriracha sauce which is fine.  Every thing was packaged great especially the Vietnamese iced coffee - they taped the straw hole through with two pieces of scotch tape crossed over in an X.  The coffee was delicious perfection - perfect balance of strong and sweet and creamy.  

The eggrolls was fresh, perfectly fried crispy and good.  The dipping sauce was what I expected and did not disappoint.   Perfectly sour-sweet with some heat.

The Dac Biet was wonderful and satisfying.   The broth tasted like a traditional slow cooked broth with a hint of cinnamon.  The meats were thinly sliced and a perfect ratio.  Thw onions were thinly sliced and the cilantro ans green onions were fresh.  The basil leaves were fresh as were the bean sprouts but I dont eat those. The noodles were a lot and I usually dont eat them but they appeared to be cooked well.  

Some self proclaimed credibility:  As a Southeast Asian I feel like I know my foods from this region. I cook it often and I eat it often."
619,79,Pho Basil,4 star rating,5/4/2020,"Quarantine Eats:

The pho is wonderful. Decent portion size and a good amount of meat given. I really, really loved the soup. I thought it was pretty authentic.

The avocado smoothie is also good. Not super sweet, but just enough and yet really smooth and creamy.

Had to dock 1 star for the summer rolls.
The summer rolls were the worst ones I've ever had in my life. It didn't even reach mediocre levels. The rice paper was way too thick, leaving the summer roll opaque. The shrimps were super small and I basically was eating mouthfuls of lettuce.

Basically 4.5/5 !"
620,80,Pho Basil,2 star rating,5/25/2020,"Sadly, I must lower my rating to two stars after a handful of more visits over the past year.

First off, the wait times are usually awful and the staff doesn't do much to make the experience any better. I've been told it would take 15-20 minutes to get seated when it usually took 30-45. Try to avoid this place during peak hours or else you will probably have to wait half an hour minimum. 

Now that's not why I am leaving a bad review... really, it comes down to the food for me. I've ordered a lot of kinds of plates yet none have been really tasty. What really disappoints me is their pho. The soup doesn't taste nice, light, and fresh as I'd expect, it tastes thickened and unpure... This goes for pho and the other special noodle soups - bo kho, pho sate, bun bo hue.. etc. In addition, I usually order yellow egg noodles and it's almost always overdone! There is nothing worse than soggy noodles for me :(. Not to mention, getting extras always results in sadness... Extra meatballs = one or two extra whole meatballs! 

I've also had the curry and rice plates, which were pretty solid but nothing special. 

Onto the drinks... Their Vietnamese coffee can be quite good - you should tell them if you like it more bitter or sweet. The bubble tea is OK but the portion is small and the boba is sometimes hard. 

In a gist:
OK: Fried rice and curry dishes, bubble tea, Vietnamese coffee, most appetizers
Bad: Noodle soups, chili oil

For unimpressive food and drinks, the prices are high. Cheap for the area? Yes, because Newbury is around the corner.. but not compared to that of other Vietnamese restaurants. And why did they have to go and get rid of the banh xeo?! At this point, I'd rather go to Beantown Pho or opt for another kind of food in the area."
621,81,Pho Basil,1 star rating,8/5/2021,"This used to be my favorite place to eat... but as of lately I feel like the quality of the food has decreased tremendously. Tonight I ordered pho sate through Uber eats. The amount of soup that this restaurant gives you has slowly decreased over the past year... and on top of that, tonight the vegetables for my soup were not washed at all.... There was dirt under the leaves, inside the chopped-up scallions and also on the tomatoes..... what happened to the quality of this place? Please see photos that I've attached"
622,82,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/8/2021,The best Pad Thai in all of Boston HANDS DOWN! I can't even allow myself to order anything else off the menu at this point because the Pad Thai trumps everything they've got. And everything else they've got is also SO GOOD.
623,83,Pho Basil,4 star rating,2/25/2020,"Above average spot. It's extremely convenient for me as far as location goes so I think that's how I know I'll be back but nothing here had me drooling.

Very generous portions and the restaurant inside is clean. They have average ingredients which make for a consistently average tasting food but it's good enough to go back for.

Very casual college-feeling atmosphere if you want to stop in for a quick bite to eat. They are quick to get you food and to turn tables so I've never had to wait long. From now on I'll probably get take-out just because of the location. An important thing to keep in mind, especially if you're not familiar with the area, for either dining in or taking out, is that parking around this area is tough unless you want to pay and arm and a leg to park at the Prudential garages and walk a block or two."
624,84,Pho Basil,5 star rating,4/14/2019,"Great bang for your buck. I got the kao soi and my boyfriend got the duck noodle soup. Both portions were bigggg. 

The kao soi was 10.95 and came with noodles, crispy noodles on top and crispy chicken. The flavor was more mild than my liking and the dry noodle on top weren't crispy which made me sad. That being said the crispy chicken was good and the egg noodles were soft and soaked up all the flavor. 

I tried the duck noodle soup and it was SO GOOD. Probably the best bowl of noodle soup I've ever had. Although you can definitely taste the msg which might be off putting for some people ( but I love msg so maybe that's why it tasted so good)

Overall I don't think you can get better quality food at his price point. Will come again!!

We went at 5 and basically got the last open table so be prepared to wait or go early."
625,85,Pho Basil,5 star rating,12/12/2021,"This is my favorite thai place in boston. Great service, amazing taste. I just wish they had more seats!"
626,86,Pho Basil,5 star rating,1/3/2020,"Wow that's the best shumai and noodle soup I've ever had in my life. 

I got the Kao Soi which is this Northern style curry noodle dish and subbed fried tofu for chicken and honestly it was the best thing I've ever eaten in my life. It had all the textures and quantity of broth you're looking for from pho but with the richness of curry. I can't say enough good things about it, like seriously it's the best dish I've ever had in my life.

The shumai was also very delicately crafted and you get eight pieces of deliciousness to share, or not share hehe! 

The boy got drunken noodles and loved it. The portion size was huge and he ate it for two meals. However, at the end of the day he wished he got the curry noodle soup I ordered.

I wish I could eat it again right now."
627,87,Pho Basil,5 star rating,7/18/2021,"The Kao soi with crispy chicken was amazing! The portion size was huge, was more than sufficient for me. Will definitely visit this place again."
628,88,Pho Basil,5 star rating,1/6/2020,"My cousin lives in the Back Bay area and recommended we try this place. It's not a very big restaurant, so we did have to wait outside for a little. However, people don't usually linger here after eating their meals, so we didn't wait any longer than 10 minutes. The menu was very basic, but I loved that we could see the several dishes on the menu and also on Yelp. I was craving the drunken noodles, and I'm so glad I got the dish! It does have a little bit of a kick, but it was so good that I continued to eat it so my mouth wouldn't burn so much! The portion size was huge though, so I did take half of it home. I'd definitely come back on my next trip to Boston!"
629,89,Pho Basil,3 star rating,11/27/2018,"I was in Boston to pick my sister up from school, and she demanded a meal of pho before the drive back. She said Pho Basil was pretty good so we went. It's a small restaurant, and it was pretty packed on Sunday for lunch. We were seated quickly anyway. 

The menu is Asian fusion, not strictly Vietnamese since I definitely saw some Thai options. I ordered the pho sate, which is basically pho with chili oil in the broth. I didn't like the tomato in it, it made the broth more sweet than salty I think. Other than that it was pretty much like any other bowl of pho. Service was pretty slow, our food came out separately instead of all at once, which was annoying since my cousin got her food after everyone else had already finished eating."
630,0,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,3/4/2022,"While attending the Boston Qualifier for a volleyball tournament, we stumbled upon this place. It opens fairly early (5am, I believe) and closes late (1AM). Our first visit was in the morning, and there were tons of baked goods. Although I did not get to try those, they looked pretty good.

This morning, I ordered an Oat Milk Latte with SF syrup, their green juice, and their Chocolate power ball. I would highly recommend the coffee. The juice was good, but nothing that would standout. Their power balls were quiet tastey!"
631,1,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"Pressed Café is an exquisite restaurant/cafe, the food here is amazing! My palate was just exploding with flavor- and I ordered vegan kebab sliders that were full of flavor, the new and updated french fries that they added to their menu, and a iced green tea which was made perfectly! I definitely recommend going here and getting a great meal for breakfast, lunch, or even dinner! They also have a bar, an outdoor patio, and of course a lovely dining area!
Pressed is the best! 
I also have to give a shout-out to Sam, he was so sweet taking my order on the register."
632,2,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/14/2022,"While in Boston for a conference at the Marriott Copley place, I saw this place was highly rated for breakfast, so my partner and I decided to give it a try! When we walked in, we were surprised at how many different meals there were from breakfast burritos to acai bowls to sandwiches and more! I ordered the ""Luck of the Irish"" breakfast burrito, which had corned beef, roasted potatoes, sauerkraut, egg, and a hollandaise sauce, as well as a coffee. After sitting down for just about a minute, the hot coffee comes out, and then after another couple minutes, the piping hot and large breakfast burrito came out as well.

The burrito itself was delish and came with a nice salsa, and I had to take half of hit back to the hotel for later because of the size. I really like the fact that the whole experience is quick and quality, since we already ordered and paid when we came in. I'd definitely recommend this place if over by the Marriott for a stay, and I hope to come again!"
633,3,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,4/10/2022,"Ordered breakfast delivered to our hotel Sunday morning at 7:30. Order arrived correctly and promptly. (Yay!)
Daughter had nuttella toast which she loved. I had the avo toast with lots of modifications. It was okay, but I can't fault the kitchen because they made the changes I requested. I added turkey sausage and it was dry. Also added egg - wish it could have been poached.
The juice was outstanding. I had the turmeric shot, and it grew hair on my chest, fo sho!"
634,4,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,9/6/2021,"Huge variety of creative meals, baked goods, juices, smoothies, coffee and alcoholic drinks, what's not to love?! All meals are made with fresh ingredients (for smoothies and juices they use real fruits), breads are fresh, and it's all very reasonably priced, esp for an expensive area like back bay! Also love that they are open so early (5 am) and close late on weekends. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating as well, and staff is very friendly and patient if you have questions about their expansive menu.

So far I've tried:

Rainbow açai bowl- açai made with fresh fruits (no purées or syrups). Very flavorful and filling! 

Crossroads kebab egg n cheese- the vegan kebab tastes like meat! Very flavorful

Mediterranean bagel (got it on a pita)- delicious on both the pita and the bagel! 

The detox- fresh pressed juice- only $9 and comes with plenty of juice! Not too sweet or bitter, very refreshing and comes in the cutest jar you can take home! 

Cappucino- made with George Howell coffee beans and comes with two cute chocolate disks you can put inside your coffee"
635,5,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,4/6/2022,We were in town for a conference and I ate here for breakfast every morning we were in town. The oatmeal was fantastic! The vegan burrito was also really good!
636,6,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"Very good option for food for the area. The price is extremely reasonable, serving portions are great, service is fast. There are a lot of food options on the menu (including vegetarian, vegan as well), and the menu is quite extensive. 

Food I've tried: (* = my favorite)
- RED DRAGON POWER BOWL* ($15): interestingly had grilled pineapples in it, came with a side of sriracha. But I really enjoyed the moistness (?) and natural sweetness that the pineapples brought to the dish especially paired with the nuttiness of the grain. (To be fair, I do love pineapples on pizza and you may disagree). The seared tuna was slightly more well done then I would like, but overall good balance of flavors.
- CLAM CHOWDER + PITA ($6 large + $1 pita): exactly how you would expect clam chowder to taste like. Pita was good, quite thick and fluffy. 

Atmosphere:
- Quite busy, especially during weekend hours. It is a seat yourself place, and you order at the counter. The food gets delivered to your table. 
- It may be challenging to find seats during peak times. 

Service:
- Even though it is busy, service is very fast. There is a self serve water station in the corner. 

Overall:
- PRO: great value for price x money, especially for the neighborhood.
- CON: seating can be difficult during peak hours."
637,7,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,12/3/2021,"Visited this place during conference in Boston. It's kind of hard to find the entrance of the cafe but the environment and the food were amazing! The breakfast burrito was surprising huge and tasted really good! I ordered the shakushuka with veggies, very satisfying with well balanced nutrition! Considering the portion size I would say this is really cheap."
638,8,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,11/18/2021,"Family was up visiting and they fell in love with this place. We ended up eating breakfast here several days and lunch one day down in Copley. The acai bowls with a dollop of peanut butter was the breakfast of choice and I had the french toast without fruit and pure maple syrup served in a glass jar. 

The restaurant seemed very efficient even during the height of the morning rush. Ordering was easy as they seem to have a button for everything on the POS system. 

Not cheap but good quality!"
639,9,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"If you're ready for some protein attack in the morning, then I highly recommend the LA steak and egg. It comes with short ribs, caramelized onions, cheese, and eggs. The meat was perfectly marinated, and this comes in VERY generous portion. 

Fair warnings about the portion of the coffee. They came in larger size than other stores."
640,10,Pressed Cafe,3 star rating,9/20/2021,"Good quality food for fast service. Reminds me of a better version of Potbelly's or Panera bread but with way more options. 

Tried: 1) Halva Tahini Latte 2) Chipotle Chicken Sandwich. The latte wasn't anything special, even though the name implies a sophisticated cultural latte - it tastes like a regular latte with honey and sesame seeds and wasn't anything standout. The sandwich was solid: good portion size, creamy chipotle spread, with a sizable amount of chicken. Bread that it was served on was wholesome and fresh!"
641,11,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,11/6/2021,Came here for breakfast and they are FAST! Like sat down and our food was already coming out on plates fast. Definitely come here if you want breakfast with a group of friends and don't want to wait!

If indoor dining, you will be given a number when you pay, and they will bring the food and drinks to your table. It's conveniently located in The Prudential building, great location to drop by after a day of shopping."
643,13,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/22/2022,Soooo yummy!  The mango passion fruit smoothie was very good. Staff was very quick and attentive. I will have to try the fruit bowls next time I'm here.
644,14,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,3/23/2022,One of the best breakfast wraps I've ever had.  Got the egg potato add sausage.  Just wow! The sauce given with it was unreal !  It's a marinara type sauce and adds a delicious taste to the burrito .  Service was great.  I will definitely be trying more from the menu! Coffee is good too!
645,15,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,9/28/2021,"Great drinks! Excellent food. Got their goat cheese mac 'n cheese which was delicious! Can't wait to try an açaí bowl! 

What makes it even better is that it's connected to Sheraton as its in the Prudential center."
646,16,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/6/2022,"Two words: (((Pressed Cafe))).  Someone should have bothered to advertise that there was a shop full of Jewish and Israeli specialties right under the damn Pru!  I'd have been coming here for at least a year instead of walking past.

Now, my meal was a bit pricey, but then again, that is because I asked them for the real grilled eggplant.  It's half an eggplant. Grilled.  Costs $8. This is the first and only time I've been able to find this dish made right in the United States.  Stringy and caramelized, NOT spongy!

On from the eggplant.  Is the pita good?  Yes, it is stretchy, fluffy, and chewy pita.  You can open up the pocket, it stretches rather than cracks, so you can put things inside it.  I put the strings of grilled eggplant inside the pita with s'hug, Yemeni cilantro hot sauce.  How was that?  Delicious.  Bready, flavorful on the eggplant, hot-and-cool on the s'hug.  Everything the dish is supposed to be.

What about the shakshuka?  If I'm listing it last there's gotta be something wrong with it, right?  Nope.  It's a spicy tomato sauce with bits of onion and pepper in it, and two well-poached eggs.  Perfect, and with nicely chewy bits of ""feta"" (is it really feta, or is it jibneh?) cheese.  And parsley, of course!  The poached-in eggs could have been just sliiiiightly less cooked, but I like them tougher anyway."
647,17,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/11/2022,I highly recommend this place for breakfast and lunch! Their breakfast sandwiches are all great! Their salads are delish and they have a great kids menu which is a plus!
648,18,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"This weekend was my first time ever in Boston, and my dad and I decided to come here on our first day because it was close to our hotel and had good reviews. Now when I tell you I'm tempted to move to Boston just for the challah french toast at Pressed, I'm not exaggerating. Out of the four days we stayed in Boston, we came to eat here on three of them. Everything we tried here was amazing and I loved the authenticity of all of the Israeli foods. On top of that, I have never had faster service at a restaurant in my life. Everything comes out within five minutes of ordering, and it's all fresh and hot from the kitchen. The menu has such a wide selection for every meal and everyone is bound to find something here. I would recommend this place to anyone, so please, if you're in Boston, try out this place. You won't regret it."
649,19,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,8/13/2021,"This place deserves all of our support as a new addition to Prudential. It's a one stop shop for your entire day's good dreams all with outstanding quality of service. 

Imagine a place you can arrive at sunrise with your books and pen and stay until the moon meets the stars. They have a coffee shop for your early morning, baked goods for early afternoons, and then stay for their paninis and sandwich lunch options. juice and smoothie during the day, dinner with Mediterranean and then a bar with a wide variety of cocktails at night. The variety blows me away and though I only came for dinner, I'd want to come back and 

5/5 for their outstanding atmosphere, service and concept despite being so short on staff!"

653,23,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,6/28/2021,"I just wanted to update my review to mention the food! The food is very good. I had a pita among other things today, and it was so much better than the ones you get in the grocery store! I guess they must make them themselves to have them be so fresh.
Also, the way you order at the counter and then they bring the food to you is perfect. That way you still get service, but there is no waiting around for the bill when you're done."

656,26,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/29/2022,We came here for breakfast while visiting for a week on vacation. One of our breakfast sandwiches was made wrong. The manager took it back and made it right. He also brought us a chocolate chip cookie as an apology. We didn't need it but it tasted great and it showed their great service. It was quick and tasted good. It reminded me of a Panera but with more breakfast options to choose from.

662,32,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,5/1/2021,"Press Café is so amazing! For breakfast, lunch, dinner or even just to grab drinks and a snack. They have a ridiculous amount of options in food to serve any and everybody, even those with the strictest dietary restrictions. 

The service is always above and beyond, everybody was so nice there. I cannot speak highly enough about the food because it was so good. I'm going to continue to keep going back there because I have to try every single item on their menu there isn't one single thing that's bad and I would recommend this place to anybody and everybody!!! 

And oh yeah, on the weekends they are open late and their Tapas Menu is so good. I have tired almost everything on it, and the Sliders are a personal favorite, but who are you kidding, you can't go wrong with anything."
663,33,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,10/29/2021,"Went in for breakfast 3 days in a row while I was staying in the area. Great latte and many many choices for breakfast and lunch. Large seating area.  Great service at the counter. All food items were very good - egg sandwich on English muffin with a real fried egg (not a precooked and reheated egg cube), oatmeal, and French toast. Next time I'm in town I'll try it for lunch and I'd love to check out the bar area."
664,34,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,9/5/2021,"Nice place. Large menu. So many things I wanted to try but it was late and opted for a kids meal.  Wow! Huge sandwich, bag of  chips and a drink for $9. It was worth it. Awesome staff. Very patient with me and all my questions, as I could have just read the menu."
665,35,Pressed Cafe,3 star rating,2/15/2022,"I had been to the Pressed Cafe on a trip to Needham and was so excited to find that there was a location back in Boston.  I immediately made an order for the Red Dragon bowl and the Vegan Guacamole stir fried greens bowl.  When the food arrived, I had a few bites of both bowls and was underwhelmed and disappointed since my previous bowl had been so good.  I went back through the order to see what might be missing, and the dressings were completely missing from both of my bowls.  None included on the side, none on the greens.  I ended up making my own and it's *fine* but I was really looking forward to the spicy peanut sauce and the guacamole lemon dressing, I feel like that's what really makes the bowls, and when I'm paying $15-20 for a single bowl I really expect everything to be correct."
666,36,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,2/13/2022,"The 60+ reviews don't lie, this place is amazing. When I was visiting Boston, I ate here 3 times over the course of 4 days. Each time the food was high quality, not too expensive, and takeout was very fast. I definitely recommend the Pressed Panini! This is a must-visit spot if you're near the Prudential Center."
667,37,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,4/23/2021,"I love everything about this place. The food is so fresh, unique and delicious.   The staff was super friendly; and the space is beautiful and clean.   Oh not to mention the bar and drinks were so cool and a great combination of flavors. Cant wait to go back!"
668,38,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,10/10/2021,In Boston for a couple days last week. Stopped by this lovely restaurant twice for breakfast. Friendly accommodating staff. Gluten free choices for wraps and burritos and lots and lots of middle Eastern  inspired recipes. Fresh and delicious and at an excellent price point. Highly recommended !
669,39,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,11/23/2021,"All I can say is ah-mazing... the vegan veggie ciabatta... RUN, don't walk. Get a side of the vegan bistro and your entire day will be made."
670,40,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,1/11/2022,"In a city with overpriced food that typically underdelivers, Pressed is a breath of fresh air. Very affordable and of excellent quality. A perfect stop for a quick bite to eat."
671,41,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,9/17/2021,Highly recommend. I had the shakshuka and was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. My husband had an açaí bowl and was also very pleased. Fresh and tasty for both. We'll be back!
672,42,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,10/16/2021,Great local breakfast spot with a varied menu.  Steel cut oats with fruit and almonds was a hit.  Come to NYC please!
673,43,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,6/17/2021,Couldn't be happier that this place exists. If I'm ever in doubt of where to go in Boston I can just come here or grab take out I know I'll eat something delicious. The staff is friendly and very patient even when I'm being annoying and keep adding random pastries. I've tried at least one item from every category and have not been disappointed with a single thing. This location also has some dishes that remind me of food I always grew up eating. I highly recommend coming to this (or any) location. Their bar is also beautiful and intimate. Will be going tomorrow lol 10/10
674,44,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,7/26/2021,"I love Pressed! All of the people who work there have been great. GRACE is a stand-out! Anytime of the day, any meal of the day. Snacks, drinks etc. The environment is great for a quick stop or if you want to stay and linger whether it be for work, social, etc. it's just very easy. I've found it to be clean, the food to be fresh, and the staff to be wonderful! I must give a special shout-out to GRACE! This young lady-her energy, her knowledge of the menu, her social skills are what every employer should hope for. She was bright and helpful-and helped to accommodate any requests while offering recommendations. The breakfast sandwiches are delicious. I took another yelper's suggestion and tried on their fresh pita! Definitely try this! We also went back a few days later and had a platter of Eastern Mediterranean delights. This platter included hummus, babaghanoush, feta, beet salad, tomato cucumber salad, and other goodies! Ask for the pita warm. We got an extra side of 5 falafels. Regarding the falafels-I want to gives another chance. They were fairly small and crunchy:"". I don't mind either of those attributes, but am unsure if this batch was over-cooked. They were not bad, but just be prepared for that. We also subbed the vegan sausage on the platter for chicken. It needed up being a whole chicken breast slices. It was very delicious and would definitely try this chicken on a salad. I would definitely try Pressed! I would definitely go again soon!"
675,45,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,11/28/2021,They had plenty of seating on a Saturday around brunch. Large open space. Great menu. Fresh pressed juice. Delicious. Also has order pickup and app.
676,46,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,4/25/2021,"A good amount of vegan options, open from 5am till 10pm which for students during this time know cafes have had stringent hours so it saved me a further walk to byChloes last night. The WiFi worked well. I liked what I got; will try more."
677,47,Pressed Cafe,3 star rating,6/25/2021,"This place is quite expensive at least for the drinks. The strawberry banana was sooooo good. However, the matcha green tea latte's were very bland and could pass for boiled water. Overall, be careful of what you choose to order from this store. Very hit or miss."
678,48,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,7/11/2021,"Walked here randomly today and was glad I did. The food was great, the staff was nice, and they prepared my meal very quickly. Very relaxed environment."
679,49,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,6/19/2021,I love this place! They have great healthy food for all different dietary restrictions. The best part for me is their wide range of non-dairy milk for lattes. Try the Chai Tea Latte with Oat Milk!
680,50,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,5/30/2021,Great selection of sandwiches and burritos.  Smoothies and coffee were also great.  Perfect spot to have a healthy breakfast or mid morning coffee break.
681,51,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,7/22/2021,"Great atmosphere, warm feel and some friendly staff. I've only tried two things off of their menu... the chicken and rice soup  and the Chipotle chicken panini, both items were delicious.   I'll be going back again."
682,52,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,11/25/2021,Sophisticated flavors which i didn't expect in a sandwich! The blue milk was very nice
683,53,Pressed Cafe,4 star rating,5/31/2021,"Great spot for fast food/to-go. I came in here the day we were leaving boston and wanted something quick. Was sceptical of the food taste, but it was good! For a fast food place, it was surprisingly pleasant. Service was fast. People were good and attentive. We got an acai bowl, vegan kebab panini and a bbq chicken panini, all were good."
684,54,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,11/17/2021,"Our go-to breakfast spot! Food is always so good as are their juices. A little price-y but delicious. Our favorites are the smoked salmon toast, breakfast burritos and the yogurt parfait (the yogurt they use is incredible). They also have a gluten-free wrap available for their breakfast burritos (hoping they offer gluten-free rolls or bagels in the future)! The staff is always friendly and the service is quick despite there usually being a lot of people in the cafe at all times."
685,55,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,9/29/2021,"Stopped here when we got off the ""hop on hop off trolley"". Reviews were good so we gave it a try. Soooo many options! We had a short rib grilled cheese with mushrooms sandwich. It was delicious. My favorite was the butternut squash soup. That was the Best!"
686,56,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,10/18/2021,A huge selection of really delicious items.  Everything our group had was excellent.  Service was super nice and helpful as well.  Highly recommend.
687,57,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,10/17/2021,"This place was fantastic. The food was delicious, the choices immense, and we couldn't appreciate more the assistance with my large family celebrating my mom's birthday weekend. Thank you to Ryan and the bartender (sorry I didn't get your name) for your incredible hospitality. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Just wish there was one in chicago!!"
688,58,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,7/29/2021,The açaí was so good and the sandwiches tasted great. I enjoyed them both. The cafe is clean and the service is super fast. Would go back again.
689,59,Pressed Cafe,5 star rating,8/30/2021,This is one of my families favorites spots for breakfast or lunch.    Delicious breakfast  and panini sandwiches.  The portions are more than fair and very filing. Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Cafe always seems to be busy yet the orders come out quick.  Will be back and will recommend to friends.
690,0,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,2/20/2022,"I couldn't find a separate posting for La Pasticceria, but wanted to note that the pasticcini (4 for 7.9$) were tiny, but had great crisp texture. A little overly sweet, but one is perfect for that sweet bite to finish a meal or as a small treat!

(Though on a warmer day when the gelato place is open... That'll still be my go-to.)"
691,1,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,12/11/2021,"There is so much going on in Eataly that it is hard to pin down one review to cover it all. I'll skip over the restaurants and talk about the plentiful other options you will find here.

But first - expect crowds! Be surprised if there is not one. Does not matter the time of day, although obviously more people will be there during meal times.

I almost always made a beeline for the specialty meats and cheeses. Wide variety and high quality. You can also buy freshly made pasta or peruse pastas, oils, and chocolates imported from Italy. And do not forget the produce market! Oh and the fish market, meat market, or dry-aged meats hanging in a window. Yea there is a lot.

There is also section dedicated to wines and beer. Again, heavy focus on Italian although you will find a lot of Dogfish Head and Cambridge Brewing as well. Good stuff. My recommendation is No Name. Its pricey but a fantastic barolo.

If you want a quick bite, you can find prepared paninis, focaccia, and gelato. I do not recall trying the gelato but I can certainly vouch for the paninis and focaccia. Big portions and big flavor.

When it comes down to it, Eataly is an experience, one that should be enjoyed often."
692,2,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,12/8/2021,"There's so much, so many areas, specialties, etc. it's a little hard to rate! It's such a fun place filled with tantalizing treats that tickle the senses. All the fun items, colorful packaging, fully stocked shelves, counters brimming with goodies... it's like Christmas everyday here.

I've tried their coffee, cannoli, tiramisu, pizza, and gotten some grocery items too. I have not been to their restaurants. In terms of their pre-made food, it's surprisingly good. The cannoli was some of the best I've ever had. I think they use a high portion of ricotta, because you really get that delicate flavor without being hit by sugar or just bland cream. The shells stayed marvelously crisp even after several hours. 

The pizza is also delicious. Great crust, generous toppings - the mushroom one was so aromatic and topped with so many juicy mushrooms!

Their coffee is so-so, but I like the ease of ordering at the station because it's separate from everything else and right by the door. The prices are decent, but it's mostly the dark-roast coffee that I'm not a huge fan of. 

Great assortment of charcuterie items, imported snacks, etc. Not a great selection of Italian beverages or sodas surprisingly (I really like this soda called Stappi, it's a bitters soda you can get in Providence on Federal Hill and Eataly doesn't have it.)."
693,3,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,4/6/2022,Not my favorite spot I would have to say. With all the fresh products around I expected better results. Mussels came out almost cold and had a strong fishy taste. Garlic taste was nonexistent. Waitress was amazing which is the only reasons they are getting two stars will definitely not go back
694,4,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,12/6/2021,"Loved eating here so much! I found my favorite wine - Etna Bianco from Sicily. It made my day because I already barely find it. 

The fig and burrata was divine and truly what dreams are made of. Got the medium charcuterie board as well. 

The day I went, there was a wine tasting! Mind blowing at it was so much fun."
695,5,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,2/18/2022,"Came on a Friday night with a reservation. It was pretty busy! We were seated within five minutes of our reservation. After we ordered, our food came out very quickly. They didn't grate the parmesan onto the pasta in front of us , it was already there. When we asked for more cheese they brought us some in a little cup which was nice. The waitress was very kind and attentive. The burrata and prosciutto was very good quality. And the bolognese was excellent; there was so much of it! Definitely didn't go hungry that night. All together it was a nice experience."
696,6,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,1/16/2022,"I have to admit that I am not sure what I think about this place.  On one hand, I am obsessed with grocery stores, markets and beautiful ingredients.  This place has all of that in spades.  The shelves are packed with hard to find, unique or exquisite meat, cheese, pasta, etc.  On the other hand, there is something sterile and gentrified about buying these beautiful ingredients in an overpriced shopping center in the Prudential.      I found myself feeling guilty that I did not make the walk over to the North End and spend my money at a family grocer.  It was a bitterly cold day so I will excuse myself this time, but I will not make the same mistake again."
697,7,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,4/8/2022,"Super busy spot that originated in New York City.  This gets VERY busy.   Crowded and packed, in fact.  There is a lot going on here.  A lot to see and a lot to eat.  There's so much going on that it's hard to even review this place.  Let's just say if you want Italian Groceries of any kind, this is your place.  Fresh and packaged dry pastas, grand and go lunch, vinegars, olive oils, packaged goods imported from Italy and the like.  Gelatos and pastries as well. It's all here.  Keep in mind it is VERY expensive."
698,8,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,9/30/2021,"Eataly in Boston used to be my go-to spot after work to wait out the traffic with a drink or two along with their delicious Italian plates! It's a huge marketplace with a dedicated area for cheese, meats, seafood, pantry items, and sweets. You can dine here as well, indoors at the bar or tables, it's a first come first serve situation. Just be prepared for a wait during prime lunch or dinner time. And outdoors, reservations can be made through OpenTable. Oh, and parking, it's Back Bay, if you can find street kiosk pay to park, great, if not, they validate parking at the Guest Relation booth with proof of $10 purchase, up to 4hrs, $15, 4-5, $20, after 5hrs, $42 at Prudential Center Garage.

Burrata- I had so many variations of their burrata. Mainly drizzled with one of their infused oil, with tomato, fig, or anchovies. Love it!
Taglieri Piccolo (Chef's selection of 3 types of meat 3 kinds of cheese)- Any of their cured meats and cheeses are fantastic.
Oysters- It wasn't fresh and both my gf and I were sick after trying their oysters. We haven't ordered it from here since then.
Old Fashioned- Amazing.
Frose- Frozen rose, this was the spot to go for it in the summer!

Overall Service: Depending on where you go, service varies in Eataly. In the grocery sections, everyone has been helpful. The dining side can be a hit or miss depending on how chaotically busy they are, but for the most part, they have been pleasant. Our bartender Lou was fun and upbeat, one of the reasons why we used to like this spot so much, but since then he's moved on and so have we. I would still recommend this place!"
699,9,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,11/5/2021,"Eataly has everything you need to please the Italian in your life or to plan and execute the perfect Italian meal in a one-stop shop (literally). From fresh produce to the butcher shop to the seafood counter to the beer and wine shop, Eataly has not only the fresh items covered but also imported packaged food and oils to ensure your pantry is fully stocked. 

I work in the Pru and Eataly has become my preferred grocery and meat shop for the items that matter. If you can't find it there, it probably can't be found in Boston!"
700,10,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,8/18/2021,"Eataly never disappoints. If you are looking for authentic Italian flavors this is the spot for you. My sister's friends from Rome, who have since moved to Boston say Eataly is the only Italian restaurant in Boston that reminds them of home. The ravioli is to die for and the cannolis are magnificent. I'm the last person you would find outside of Mike's pastries or Modern bakery for cannolis, mainly because it's just not my go to dessert. However, Eataly's mini cannolis are something else. I would vote them the best ones in Boston. The ricotta is so luscious and creamy!
 
Also, please note that you can get validated parking if you park in Prudential. Save your money, don't waste $20 to park. Instead use it towards a nice meal with your friends and family!"
701,11,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,3/10/2022,"Very reasonable experience here at La Pizza/Pasta for restaurant week in Boston. Got an appetizer and main for 19$/person - all the apps and half of the main options were vegetarian. We got the cacio e Pepe and margarita pizza for mains - basic but delicious. Pizza feels neopolitan style with a soft thin crust so if you like to be able to pick up a piece and have it hold it's own,  this probably isn't for you. Cacio e Pepe was great, al dente with a good bite and not too heavy. Not sure what full prices are like, but restaurant week specials were definitely worth it for a nice dinner out."
702,12,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,11/22/2021,"Whether you are looking for a bite to eat or cooking supplies, Eataly Boston is a spot worth checking out. There are fast-casual and sit-down restaurant options inside of this very large Italian-focused grocery. There is a deep selection of wines and food to enjoy or take home as well as some pre-prepared items. The environment is very lively and unique and carries a fabulous selection of everything from fresh produce to cheeses and pastries. In addition, there are a number of kitchen implements and pantry supplies to be found here. Even if you are just wandering and looking for ideas, you can definitely burn quite a bit of time here.

I enjoyed the experience and look forward to a second visit. Looking forward to my visit when I return to Back Bay!"
703,13,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,6/14/2021,"This mega market in the middle of Back Bay is amazing.   I have already been to the Eataly in NYC and Chicago....and this one has been done very well.   The two main entrances are either through the Prudential Center or by coming through their Patio restaurant on Boylston. 

Eataly delivers.  It has a great combination of market, restaurant, grocery story, coffee shop, candy shop, gelato place, etc.   You can get a whole fresh fish, a side of ham, or a piece of Italian candy....and...anything in between.   In their wine shop you can get a bottle for about $15-20 upwards to the Thousands !!!!   Your pick......

There are several restaurants inside this complex.   Terra is upstairs with a nice patio and skylight dining area.   The Pizza and Pasta place is kind of in the middle of the entire store and the Patio is outside.   There are also many different areas where you can get prepared foods.    The quality of the goods here is amazing, so the prices reflect that.  Some of the stuff is very high end, but it depends on what you want and what you are looking for.

Check it out next time in Back Bay."
704,14,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,11/26/2021,"This is pretty much like all the other Eataly's I been to. It's seems smaller than the one in NYC and Chicago.  The food was delicious. It's all fresh and has quality ingredients. Had a Margarita pizza and gelato. The pizza had a nice crust , mild flavor, and a light fresh mozzarella.  The gelato was rich in the dark chocolate , and was deep in flavor.  If it was bigger, I would of given it 5 stars."
705,15,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,7/4/2021,"Hard to navigate the space when lots of folks are there. 
We ate in the pasta/pizza restaurant. Really good. Fresh flavors on our ravioli and calzone. 
Server was super nice. 
It was loud but also the store part was packed. 
Well def go back."
706,16,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,6/8/2021,"This review is for Il Patio di Eataly

Pretty enjoyable dining experience on the beautiful patio at eataly. Love the decor and the set up but they were really understaffed which affected our experience. We had to wait to be seated even with a reservation and it took over an hour for our food to arrive and it wasn't even hot. I got the vongole and my friends got the ravioli, pappardelle, and the bolognese all of which they seemed to enjoy. My pasta also felt undercooked. It all still was delicious and love the ambiance , but for the prices, you expect the quality of food and service to be a bit better.

Follow me on ig for more recs @sophiaeaats!"
707,17,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"For appetizer we started with the prosciutto, which was super delicious and just enough to wet our appetite for two people. I got the bucatini, which comes with guanciale in pecorino romano cheese. This was truly one of the best pastas I've had. The guanciale was crispy and not too greasy, and the sauce was just divine. For wine, I highly  recommend the opera lambrusco. It's a red sparkling, and I loved it so much I bought a bottle to bring home with me."
708,18,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,9/29/2021,"I came here to grab a quick snack and I wasn't very impressed. I wanted to try a couple pastries and a drink so I ordered the croissant, espresso cake and hot chocolate. 

Everything was bland and didn't have much flavoring. The hot chocolate also wasn't plugged in when I ordered and was sitting there for a while so it tasted very weird. 

The marketplace however is very nice and has a lot of different things to purchase"
709,19,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,1/31/2021,"Buongiorno!

My son moved to Boston and tells me there is a Eataly that is just as good as NYC. I say don't be ridiculous. However! We're going out to dinner, I suggest we stop there and bring home some pastry. 

Walking to the location, its inside a mall? We take the escalator up and walk into the Italian Wizard of Oz. 

Meats, Cheeses, Pastries, Gelato, Chocolates, freshly made Pastas and Breads Did I just describe heaven? I asked a worker do they have any Calabrian chili paste, he points to a small grocery area, where they had none.

We walk over to the pastry section. How could you choose? You want everything on display. There are four of us, my wife sees a sign: 8 items for $20 dollars. It made it easy for us to choose. I'm choosing Tiramisu, its my favorite and Eataly makes it very well. The dusting of cocoa powder on top, mmm... I also grabbed a loaf of bread to bring back to Long Island. 

First time here and I'm very impressed. If your from New York City and want a taste of home, come to Eataly."
710,20,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,1/24/2021,"Yes, it's probably overpriced, but there's so much going on here that it has to be seen to be appreciated. It's almost as extensive as its New York counterpart, with countless stands, cases, bars, and restaurants with just about anything Italian that you could imagine, whether fresh meats, seafood, antipasti, pastries, gelati, cheese, wine, espressi, and, of course, freshly made pasta and pizze. Some of the counters have active kitchens behind them where you can observe the staff at work from behind large, clear windows - literally constant, real-time cooking demonstration. On that note, they offer in-person cooking classes (in normal times).

This Boston outpost is tailored to the abundance of fresh, local seafood that's available here in New England. If you enter from its dedicated street-level entrance here at Prudential Center (a few steps west of the main entrance/escalators to the mall), you'll be greeted with huge displays along the walls emphasizing Eataly's local sourcing. You then ascend a flight of escalators to the main market hall. Boston foodies will appreciate that noted local restaurateur Barbara Lynch, of Menton and Sportello fame, is one of Eataly's key collaborators.

Even if many things are out of your price range, this is still a huge, beautiful venue to peruse. It really puts the Prudential Center shops on the map as a worthy stand-alone destination - not just the declasse sibling to the more upscale Copley Place shops a footbridge away."
711,21,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,3/21/2022,"The ambiance was lovely but unfortunately the food was not worth the cost. Our table got the avocado toast, polenta, and brioche French toast.

The poached eggs were all cooked differently. Our table had three in total: one was undercooked to the point of the whites being runny, the next was over cooked like a hard boiled egg, and the last one was cooked correctly. 

The polenta was not well seasoned and there was no salt and pepper on the table for us to personally adjust. Other than the seasoning and the egg, the polenta was tasty and was a decent portion size. The avocado toast also tasted good besides the poached eggs and was a decent serving size. 

The French toast was only one and a half pieces and came with approximately three blueberries and less than one strawberry. Since this French toast was such a small meal, we requested a side of eggs which was not accommodated despite us being willing to pay for it. I think Terra at Eataly could be a cute spot to grab a drink, but the food was not worth it."
712,22,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,6/27/2021,"Two slices of prosciutto and 4 pieces of gnoccho fritto. 20 dollars robbed. This doesnt hold a candle to that closed Babbo at seaport which funny enough is owned by the same company. 

Pasta dish was a full hand slap to every italian. Zero, absolutely zero taste. My high school cafeteria line chefs had at least courtesy to dash their pasta with some flavor. Almost had to tell the waiter to take it back but was thankful he at least screwed up and brought us one plate instead of the other so I could avoid sending both back. I let it slide.

If you're a tourist or have never tasted what good italian food really is, this is your spot. Just an embarrassment all around."
713,23,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,2/20/2022,I love this place. My favorite thing to do when I've either experienced a really bad thing or really good thing (Breakup? Birthday? Eately.) I always go to la pizza la pasta and get pizza and a fancy soda. Then I explore and get some kind of dessert or chocolate. So fun.
714,24,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,5/12/2021,"Mostly come here for fresh fish (red snapper. Cod. Yum!) and groceries and give half my pay check to them. 

Highly recommend the fresh pasta

Omg the truffle sauce or truffle cream is to die for- pair it with their beet root gnocchi:)

Thank you eataly you make weeknight dinners amazing"
715,25,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,2/28/2022,The food  is outstanding. All of it. BUT the music is unbelievably loud. I was with a friend at 11:30 am trying shop. I felt like I was in a bad nightclub. I wanted to eat lunch but we bagged it. We couldn't even talk above the awful music. How about this? How about some nice classical music at a decibel level that allows conversation without yelling?
716,26,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,12/6/2021,"I love this place. Love taking my time here looking at all the wonderful products. And eating here is another experience that is not to be missed. But this review is for the wine store portion of the store. Eric is ahem. He is knowledgeable and helpful. He really wants to know what you're looking for and doesn't pick the most expensive item necessarily... he makes a few suggestions because he wants you to be satisfied with your purchase. Eric is also great at making suggestions when you don't really know what you're looking for. He has been a real help and kind and professional. I like the selection in this shop and the location makes it easy for a one stop shop for wine, grocery, and prepared foods."
717,27,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,11/23/2020,"Such an amazingggg find! Tucked inside Copley Place, this little Italian eatery was full of fresh and flavorful Italian cuisine! It is set up like a marketplace on the outsides, with a fresh produce section in the middle and a restaurant. It's everything your dream of in a cute market! 

The price point was a little high but expected for the quality. I wish I could have gotten so much more but there is always a next time!"
718,28,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,4/14/2021,I've never seen this kind of establishment before but what a great concept...a little grocery store selling fresh produce with healthy fast food diners in the middle of the market.  Perfect for mall shoppers.  Just here to buy waters and cold pressed juices to take to the hotel.  Very friendly staff.
719,29,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,12/24/2021,We would probably give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for an unpleasant hostess... but it turned out to be a benefit because we ended up going to another restaurant in Eataly because of her and it was GREAT! The waiters were so friendly and though we had to wait they were helping me find a seat as quickly as possible. The food exceeded our expectations! Let me tell you about this mozzarella - SO good - we could eat 3 more of these delicious balls. The pasta was really good too as well as the proscuitto! Such a fun and cute atmosphere - will definitely be back!!
720,30,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,3/29/2022,The restaurant was extremely disappointing- the food reminded us of fast food - the store is intriguing but everything is overpriced
721,31,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,11/2/2021,"My husband and I were excited to try out Eataly during their $25 deal for an appetizer and entree earlier, so we had to stop by! The atmosphere was nice and the customer service was great as they helped us get seated quickly. Everything sounded really great, including the wine choices. We ordered the sliced raw fish of the day (crude del giorno) and mushroom pasta (tagliatelle al ragu di funghi) from the $25 deal menu, then also ordered the truffle egg yolk pasta (tajarin con tartufo nero) and the 18-month prosciutto. Out of everything we ordered, we mostly enjoyed the prosciutto. I must say, the pastas were a bit mediocre and not what we expected. We love truffle and we had truffle egg yolk pasta before from other places, but the truffle was way too subtle, barely noticeable, in this pasta. I enjoyed the mushroom pasta more. I would say if I'm in the mood for some Italian dishes, I would much rather go to North End for some finer options."
722,32,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,5/3/2021,Geez this is an Italian foodie heaven. Wish they would open one in Portland. I could have spent an hour just drooling over the prosciutto selection. We needed a break from our walking tour of Boston and got some beverages and the pesto pizza at the cafe. The Napoli style pizza crust was excellent. I was totally re-energized for our 2 mile walk home. Check it out.
723,33,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,4/2/2021,"Love me some Eataly. Want pizza? They got it. Pasta? That too. Tiramisu, cannolis, gelato, espresso? Yup. Oh, and a whole grocery shop with additional restaurants enclosed? Indeed. 

Eataly is a great place to stop in for lunch, bring guests through, or shmy around on a rainy day as it's basically an indoor market. The food is always fresh and delicious, but the prices are steep, super crowded and difficult to navigate, and seating is very limited. 

From taste alone? Fantastic. My orders:
- the foccaccia style pizzas! Pictured is the tomato mozzarella (caprese I think!) 
- panini with fresh mozzarella and bacon (instead of prosciutto)
- build you own salad
- straciatella gelato"
724,34,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,9/7/2020,"This review is for my DoorDash delivery experience with eataly. I've had much better experiences visiting in person!

Ordered a salsiciotta pizza - sausage mushroom and basil. It showed up with scant toppings, was super cold, and wasn't even sliced??? It came in the box that people usually use to serve pizza that you eat immediately out of this box so I found this to be very puzzling.... 

Sliced it on my own and then heated it up in a pan with the lid on so I could revive the crust and steam the toppings and cheese. Weird pizza experience. 

Pizza was $19 and personal size.

Probably would not order this ever again because of lack of ready-to-eat prep and portion to price ratio. Stick to elsewhere for your pizza. Glad I got this off a DoorDash promo and didn't pay for most of it... I'll give 2 stars instead of 1 bc the pizza was good after heating it up and slicing it."
725,35,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,8/30/2021,"Such a great spot in prudential center.they sell desserts, wine, cheese, meat and lots lots of imported snacks. U can also choose to sit down and order hot food such as pizza from them.I absolutely love places like this because they are so convenient and they offer A LOT OF options."
726,36,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,10/5/2021,"Great place And great people!!! The food is excellent...
Our bartender Ronnie was simply the best, very Knowledgeable, fun and with a great Sense of humor. 
I will definitely be back with friends and family. 
Highly recommended!"
727,37,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,9/14/2021,I've come here a handful of times with friends. They offer a decent selection of gelatos and sorbets. The workers are usually friendly but other times not. Prices are fair considering being in Prudential Center. Not anything crazy but would come if in the area.
728,38,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,9/11/2021,"Not sure how many times I have passed by this place ,which used to be the food court back in the day. I decided to go in to check it out & it is big, like holy hell there is so much going on. There is an entire restaurant inside as well as a market for you to shop. Who would have guessed that there is so much going on inside w/ the prepared foods, gelato, pastries, cheeses, etc. So yeah this place has so much going on that it's always busy at all times. That is the hardest to deal w/ during a pandemic. So whatever you may be in the mood for- snack, beverage, pizza, dessert, they have it. You will find items here that you will never fond in a regular supermarket. I would say the best find ever was the vegan chocolate hazelnut spread made w/out palm oil. So brace yourself for all the congestion of people but the goodies are worth it."
729,39,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,10/12/2020,"This review is solely for Terra. Unfortunately, while the rooftop is beautiful, there are no views and it gets pretty cold. Their service is really fantastic and our waiter came to let us know when he went on a break and introduced us to the new waiter that would be filling in. 

Our food was delicious and so were our drinks. However, we prob won't order the mushroom appetizer again. You get 4 rock solid mushrooms that don't have much flavor. The pasta and scallops were incredible. 

They also have season inspired drinks if you're not into wine. Their wine is incredible however, priced higher than their specialty cocktails."
730,40,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,7/19/2021,"Perfect, there is nearly too much to love and there is plenty to take home be it in the car, or on the plane. It's expensive but it's such a great, curated collection of Italian love, that you just have to LOVE IT. I haven't tried every dining option preferring to grocery shop for a later picnic or the pantry."
731,41,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,1/14/2022,"I've heard so many wonderful things about Eataly, so I was excited to finally get to experience it in Boston. Reservations for 2 on Friday night were easy, staff was accommodating, wine list was lovely with broad choices and good descriptions, food was delicious! It's black truffle season with many options to include with meal. Bread and olive oil was hearty, but we added the bruschetta and calamari as starters! Barely made it through the pasta to save room for dessert. Open floor plan in the middle of all of the Eataly shopping areas in the peak of Omicron, but it was fun and lively and felt safe!"
732,42,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,3/25/2021,"Food: 3/5 but I really like the concept of Eataly and the fact that there are so many offerings to try from!

I'd recommend going there for their cheese & meat selection- seems like a great place to making your own charcuterie & cheese board.

The pizza is nothing amazing, but it is pretty good.  Not warm though.  The Limoncello was enjoyable."
733,43,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,3/4/2021,"I've only gotten take out so I can't speak on anything but that. I will update when I visit in person.

This is a good spot for cheat day food. 
I've had the agnolotti di coniglio, tiramisu della nonna, patate fritte, profiterole al caramello salato, cotoletta Alla Milanese (and a bottled limonata)

The desserts were to die for! So flavorful, not too sweet and the right amount of fat content on the tongue. (Again, it is a cheat day).

The Milanese cutlet was dry and disappointing. Having spent lots of time being Italian mothered where I learned to love this dish, I can give you an address to a place where you can get East Boston's (and maybe Boston's) best Milanese cutlet. I guess you can't beat home cooking. While you're in East Boston, you might want to pop by Rino's. I assure that you won't be disappointed with the food. The parking situation is a whole other story. 

The agnolotti di coniglio was edible but lacking in much craved flavor and texture. This may be because it was cold and I warmed it up in the microwave. This might have been more palatable if it was eaten when freshly cooked. 

I wish restaurants would consider what travels well and heats up well in microwaves (because I know I'm ordering in to avoid cooking and dirty dishes) in planning their delivery menus."
734,44,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,12/8/2021,"Great merchandise, food samples, Italian food..overall great to walk thru albeit slightly pricy.

Wonderful experiences here, always."
735,45,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,12/7/2020,"Can't wait to return for another proper visit after Covid. It's truly an experience. Great place to bring tourists that are visiting and you can enjoy as well. Wine tastings and lots of sampler stuff. 

Before you eat make sure that you walk through the entire store. There are tons of options for food and drink here. Also great options of food you can take home and hard to find Italian items.  Cheeses, wines, cookies, cured meats, freshly prepared pasta, sauces, and even flour for baking and making your pasta at home. Don't forget the coffee."
736,46,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,10/4/2021,"Had an amazing meal and the best service  in EATALY Boston !   From the hostess to the manager. We sat at the bar and Ronnie was our waiter !  He created  an amazing experience for my husband and I ! Very knowledgeable, fun and entertaining.  
Will definitely return on my next trip to Boston.!

Love from NYC"
737,47,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,10/3/2021,"Really. After a nice meal with friends. Lovely service and a $350 check - the people who stamp the parking rudely demanded to see the receipt which had been left at the table and
Initially refused to validate my parking. Sunday night. Not full restaurant. $350 check and I had to prove I'd eaten in the restaurant to get a parking validation. Rude. Snippy and uncalled for. Bad form."
738,48,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,9/15/2021,I have been to Eataly many times. It's one favorite places to eat at Backbay. They serve amazing pizzas and pastas. But my favorite is the cannoli. It is the best cannoli you can get in Backbay area. Definitely recommend this place to satiate your Italian craving.
739,49,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,12/22/2020,"Found this place within the mall. I was roaming around and I figured let me go in here to check this place out. I felt like I was in Italy. With so many different things to purchase. They had a station where you can purchase fresh pasta and have it made fresh. They also have several other sections such as a dessert section, pizza, and also cheese. This is just a few that they include however, there are more to choose from. One aspect that I like about this place is you can get everything fresh. I also love how they had a large variety of cooking oils. I would definitely make this apart of my list for my next visit to Boston!  I purchased fresh pasta with truffle oil and cheese. I also had fresh cannolis made for me. Great place!"
740,50,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,6/15/2020,"I love walking around here, it's great to look at the constantly changing food items and household goods (pasta shaped oven mitts whaat!), sip some wine, have some espresso, and perhaps have a lazy lunch. The store is extremely well decorating and changes with the seasons. There are so many perfect gift ideas, such as panettone around winter, delicious olive oil year round, wine of course, and various cute kitchen items. 

The restaurants are all amazing! I absolutely adore Terra for a nice long dinner with family, and the patio for a great aperetivo hour or a date with spritzes and small plates. The tiramisu is SO GOOD!! Special kudos goes out for all the care taken during the pandemic- everything is sparkling clean, all staff wearing masks, and all tables (outdoors of course) 6 feet apart and with digital menus."
741,51,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,1/11/2022,I love this place. I feel like I'm in Little Italy. I love their large selection of cheese and crackers.
742,52,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,1/2/2021,"I do like Eataly for fun little gifts, and it's a great place to take tourists. Being from the West Coast, Eataly is something I have never heard of before, so it has always been kind of a ""special"" place to go for me. So, it is nice to go to for speciality items like unique pasta, sauces, treats, etc., but I find it rather unorganized. It's a bit like a maze inside, and hard to see what your options are for shopping if you aren't familiar with the layout of the market. It's also slightly cramped. I wish they had more local items, but I have to give them props for labeling New England specialty products with a big ""LOCAL"" tag. 

All in all, I think it's worth going to if you've never been before or if you're planning to make an Italian dinner, you may find something you like!"
743,53,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,11/12/2021,"I went to eataly with some friends for a happy hour and it was so much fun! They have a variety of wines and cocktails and we split a charcuterie board. They also have a large selection of meats, cheeses, wines, pastas, desserts, and basically everything you could want!"
744,54,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,1/27/2022,Very rude staff. They were not understanding at all to my disabled husband. It was extremely embarrassing and felt uncomfortable with how we were treated. Please don't support this business if you respect everyone should be treated the same.
745,55,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,8/8/2021,"My friend and I recently visited Il Patio at Eataly before a concert at Fenway Park. It was the perfect night to sit outside and enjoy the weather! We decided to split Fritto Misto Di Mare and Pizza Alla Parmigiana. The first dish was a mix of calamari, shrimp, and clams, which were all tasty! The one downside to this dish was that more than half the crate was filled with potato chips and there didn't seem to be too many shrimp and clams. The pizza was delicious. It reminded me of a pizza I once had in Capri, Italy. It definitely had an authentic Italian taste! We will definitely be back."
746,56,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,10/19/2021,Horrible restaurant. The food is disgusting & the service is deplorable. I've had better Ragu that taste better than this restaurant. Plus the staff and employees are very racist and only cater the to white people. People please avoid this place at all cost.
747,57,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"Eataly is a very lively place. The servers are nice, courteous, and friendly, and the Butternut squash soup tastes great. On my first night in Boston, after a long flight from LA, I was looking for warm soup to help me get rid of my exhaustion. Those folks at Eataly are amazing."
748,58,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,12/19/2021,"This is about the grocery shopping experience. We still love food from their restaurants. We do grocery shopping in Eataly but in the recent months, their quality control is not in place. They were selling expired baby arugula, packaged mortadella was discolored, and a packaged cheese that we buy every other week (freshly cut over the counter was fine though) labeled to be good for months had molds all over when we opened after a few days we got. The most disappointing experience was from the meat section. We got chicken sausages and found out they were spoiled! This is not acceptable, especially their price is exorbitantly high for everything. Very disappointing."
749,59,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,3/22/2022,"Came in here with my white friend and as she was getting pizza to go, I took a quick sip of my hot tea and a worker from a completely different section came over and yelled at me like I was a dog or something saying I'm not suppose to eat or drink in there because I needed to keep my mask. Didn't make sense to me as I saw another non POC customer across the room from me without a mask on one of there workers in the back also didn't have their mask on. This was my first time ever coming into this overpriced establishment and I would never return. My friend, whom I mentioned is a white woman even told me that the worker didn't need to bark at me like how she did and give me so much attitude even after I apologized and said I was unaware of the rules because I see others not following them in the store and she just rolled her eyes at me and walked off. Very rude and disturbing, I didn't purchase anything from there due to how I was treated."
750,60,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,8/19/2020,"I get it, it's Covid times.  But that's not an excuse for really bad service.  We had to ask three different people for peppers.  Our food was cold by the time we got it.  We couldn't get any extra silver to serve with.  Every single thing was a struggle here.  The dinner was good but we had to pile up our appetizer plates and move them to the side so we had room for our dinner plates because no one picked them up.  It was a mess all around."
751,61,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,12/3/2021,"Food was good. Service was sufficient but pleasant. Unfortunately, small portions and well overpriced. Water salad and a small pasta dish was $50 with tip. In Italy a portion of pasta this size is an appetizer."
752,62,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,10/17/2021,"We stopped at Eataly for a late lunch Saturday afternoon and ordered the fixed price, 2 course meal. Appetizers / salads arrived after a short wait. One pasta entree arrived after a longer wait, and we waited at least another 30min for two chicken entrees. The wait staff were very apologetic and the manager offered a dessert, but at that point, we just wanted to leave.

However, the salads, pasta, and chicken dishes were very good. Recommend not opting for the black truffle surcharge: there was no truffle fragrance presumably from fungi older than 2wks or so.

The specialty markets in Eataly are impressive: the butcher has the best dry-aged steaks, the cheese and salami selections are amazing, with both US and imported options."
753,63,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,5/14/2021,"So darn good! Granted the wait to eat was a little longer than preferred, even with a reservation, but it was so worth it. The food is fantastic and we dined on fresh pasta and veal and pizza. After we were done we went and spent way too much money in the actual store as we stocked up on past and cheeses for home. It was amazing.  The place was jamming with people and we were so happy to leave full and looking forward to more good food at home. Love this area of Boston as well and it is perfect."
754,64,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,11/6/2021,"My friends and I got their ready made foods and it was honestly really really horrible.
I got lasagna and it wasn't even lasagna??
So normally it's sheets of pasta with layers of stuff right?, but this was a ton of strips of pasta formed together to mimic lasagna?? It was very funny honestly lmao.
 also it was just horribly bland and a bad mushy texture 
My friends couldn't even finish their food and man this would be tolerable if it was some other grocery store but this was hella expensive and everything else about the place made it seem that this would be good quality but womp womp my friends and I took that L 

Im sure their actually food stands are nice (hopefully) but they were all closed so we didn't try anything from there"
755,65,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,8/15/2020,Large Italian themed market & restaurant center! Markets mostly overpriced specialty food! But that's what specialty foods are! Just tried the pizza restaurant. Food was above average. Gillato stand was closed which was a downer.
756,66,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,10/5/2021,"My wife and I headed out to Eataly this past Saturday night and had some of the most amazing pizza we've eaten in quite a while.
Our night was topped off when we decided to sit at the bar for some after dinner drinks....not only were the cocktails sensational but our bartender, Ron, had us in stitches the whole time we were there. What a character!
Definitely one of Boston's best. Hands down.
Made our night that much more memorable!!"
757,67,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,10/3/2021,We had a great time at Pizzaria with our server Maria who helped us pick very tasty drinks!
758,68,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,11/11/2019,"High class Italian eating and shopping, and this was quite the treat. 

Little did I know they have a location in other big cities, but this is not Olive Garden I am talking about here, so I can write about this one and not feel guilty about it. 

The food here is not cheap, but getting the $18 two course meal really paid off. It comes with an unlimited amount of bread, which tastes fresh and delicious. The pasta is also superb (I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli with the beef carpaccio). Yes the plates are a bit on the small side (but not too small), but the experience and smells that you go through when you come in just take you to another level. It took me a lot of restraint not to buy the whole store because I would have if I had the strength, money, and power to do so!

It is located right inside the Prudential Center, a high class mall reminiscent of Tyson's II in DC. But this one is better laid out and has less foreigners rummaging through to find the perfect deals. 

I totally recommend coming to this shop/restaurant and getting yourself a hearty dinner. This is what Back Bay is all about, this, right outside downtown! Get on the Orange Line and get your butt out here, now!"
759,69,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,7/23/2020,"We were wandering around Boston and in a pasta kind of mood. Initially, we were just browsing because we were thinking of buying the ingredients for a pasta dinner but then I noticed they had a nice restaurant set up and some great sounding pizzas so we wandered over and the host got us a table.

My one gripe is their QR code menu refused to work. I kept trying and it never opened. Even the waiter helped with no luck. Eventually, after trying probably 5 times, he offered us paper menus. Once we said it wasn't working I feel that the menus should have been offered. 

The menu isn't huge but has some really cool sounding items. We ended up going with a pizza with sweet sausage and mushrooms. Word of warning - the pizza is delicious but not huge. If you're really hungry it might make sense to order an app or salad because between the two of us we walked away loving it but still hungry. The bread they gave us before the meal was just so so and the dipping sauce didn't taste mixed correctly so I didn't have more than a bite. The water they gave in the bottle was warm - I think they probably want you to order sparkling and that's by design. Our waiter never checked to see if we wanted more water (we did) and kind of just threw the bill when we were done. Gave me the impression that since we weren't ordering a lot or alcoholic drinks we weren't as valued which I see sometimes and really dislike. For comparison, the table of young girls near us had a ton of drinks and food and he went over to them at least 7 times while we ate and never saw him again. 

Four stars for the food but the service really was pretty lacking. Not sure we'd eat in again here."
760,70,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,1/26/2022,"Excellent food, great atmosphere, selection superb, convenient parking with discount validation.  Many options, so call ahead or look on website to investigate choices.  It makes for a fun evening."
761,71,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,10/5/2021,"I don't remember what I ate, I was so busy trying to get settled coming from out of town. I had a great drink and wonderful conversation with Ron. He is a keeper."
762,72,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,7/20/2021,"i want to live in eataly. 

the pizzas we ordered were amazing and i spent more time looking at everyone else's food and salivating than looking at my own mother. every night since, i've dreamt of these two delicious pizzas and how to return for another meal. 

the shopping and grocery area looked amazing- all of the fresh pastas and meat made me want to move to boston for that alone. 

papa john's has been forever ruined thanks to this pizza."
763,73,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,6/25/2019,"What a great accident to run across Eataly in the Prudential Center. The timing was perfect too since my daughter and I were starved after touring. 

One may want to call this the Prudential Center food court. However, that would not serve it justice since it so much more and has an identity that's truly Boston. This is a destination for locals and tourist alike and not what I first would have thought being a tourist trap.  

Expect busy especially during lunch rush with all the area offices. There are stations within the Eataly such as coffee, pizza and ice-cream. But there's so much more like the best deli in probably the entire Boston metro area tucked in back. Even houseware items. In the center is an upscale sit down Italian. The dishes I observed on tables looked marvelous. 

My daughter and I had slices of pizza from an eye popping assortment of over probably 10 varieties.  I got a slice that resembled a salad, my daughter a pepperoni. Both scrumptious! The staff was friendly. Expect higher end on the cost, this ain't no Sbarro's Pizza. 

Then we moved onto ice-cream. They will provide samples of anything you like. I got a caramel variety, my daughter too! The staff smiled and was friendly. It was a bit awkward that a male manager scolded a staff in front of us for not wearing a hair net.

This is distinctly a Boston creation and a destination worthy of checking out when in the area."
764,74,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,7/14/2021,"Had two ten-dollar sandwiches in our group, the caprese and the roasted chicken. Neither were any better than at a gas station, very little flavor. No detectable arugula flavor in the ""arugula pesto"" just greasy. They sure do know how to make a menu SOUND appetizing though, I'll give them that. Crammed tight enough in the cafeteria style seating that mine at least picked up a little flavor from the heavily perfumed woman behind me. Not really what I was looking for though. Will not be back, what a waste of prime real estate. Their grocery store may be good but their food is sub-par."
765,75,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,4/8/2021,Tried the Margherita Pizza and it instantly took me back to my eurotrip. 11/10 would recommend and will be coming back to try others
766,76,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,6/29/2021,So overpriced! We won't because my kids wanted some pasta. Not the same experience as NYC. Portions were tiny yet so expensive. Quality of food is good but we're not at a fancy restaurant.
767,77,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,8/26/2021,Food was bland and service substandard. The seem to have a good variety of products tho. Over priced.
768,78,Eataly Boston,3 star rating,8/15/2019,"Eataly encompasses the whole market that includes a bunch of Italian restaurants inside. Overall, the entire place was pretty packed since there was a conference going on nearby. The quickest line was for the sliced focaccia pizzas. We were on a time crunch and decided that would be the best option. 

I got the funghi pizza and it was very, very mushroomy. Every bite was filled with mushrooms. I did get a little tired if it towards the end. On the plus side, the texture of the focaccia was nice and soft. If you're looking for an easy, quick bite this place will do the trick."
769,79,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,1/1/2022,"I stopped at store to purchase some Italian chocolate and entire shelf had a tag displaying  specific price but the item rang at a higher price at the register (33% higher). So, I asked to speak with a manager who I showed the product placement on the shelf and the corresponding price listed for resolution. The manager AGREED that the price tag was incorrect, immediately removed the tag from the shelf (because it was wrong), but REFUSED to honor the price that was on the shelf for my purchase. In disbelief I asked multiple times because she was agreeing with error but continue to say that they would not price match. It was like ""sorry it had the wrong price but it is what it is!"". Please note although this was a small price difference and understand that errors do happen, the management team should have taken the proper action and honored the priced as DISPLAYED, at a minimum. It is not about the small dollar difference but about what is right: accurately displaying the product's price and treating your customer the right way. This was an extremely frustrating experience and they made me feel shameful for asking for a correction that is in my right as a consumer. Love the restaurants at this place but will never return given today's  event."
770,80,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,5/31/2021,"Delicious Italian food. Was the first time trying the chain and was very impressed with how fresh the ingredients were. Pasta aldente and delicious.

771,81,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,10/5/2021,Great experience overall. Great food. Great service. Ronnie the bartender kept us all laughing-and I don't even drink!  We will be back for sure.
772,82,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,7/23/2021,Came here for happy hour and made a res for the patio. Do make a res as it books up quickly and walk in may be difficult. Great patio seating and they serve bread and service was great. The oysters were also beautifully shucked from Martha's Vineyard. Overall one of my favorite HH oyster place in town
773,83,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,9/1/2019,"I know it's super touristy (reminds me of a Disney-fied Italy) but I come here every time I'm in Boston because:

It's fun, looks great, and good people watching.
I like to go with a large group of family and find something for everyone - the kids and the seniors. 

We usually graze at the grab and go type places or have oysters at the wine bar and move on to sitting down for dinner at the pizza and pasta place and then walk through the market afterwards for gelato or pastry. 

I have tried the salumi/mixed Italian cold cut appetizer, pizza and pasta and they are pretty solid. I prefer the pizzas over the pastas as the pasta dishes did not taste seasoned enough for me. The cacio Pepe is sadly bland. And it is pretty expensive all around especially the market items.

That's why I think the food is around four stars instead of five - the pasta dishes are mediocre and the prices are high. 

But for a rainy day in Boston or a snowy day in Boston or an unbearably humid day in Boston check it out. Since it's inside you'll be protected from the elements and your belly will be happy."
774,84,Eataly Boston,5 star rating,8/6/2019,"I came here three times during my short (four day) trip to Boston.

This isn't the first eatily I've been to, I've been to both of the locations in New York.  If you've been to other eatily locations, it's pretty much the same except the restaurants and coffee bar is slightly different.  

I loved the coffee bar at this location! Or at least, the pastries they sold there.  The first day I visited, I got their chocolate and custard croissant.  The next day, I got their burnt wheat and white chocolate croissant and I definitely recommend both !

They can be a bit slow at preparing the coffee so be prepared to wait if you order a drink.  

Walking around the first floor, you can get cheese, produce, fresh pasta, as well as a variety of other foods and goods to bring home.  There are also many take out options such as pizza, sandwiches, and salads.  

They have three restaurants within the market. I tried Terra which I will review separately on their Yelp page (: overall, great place to go whether it be for a sit down lunch or to grab a quick bite to go!"
775,85,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,2/12/2019,"I just love walking around in this store! It has variety of Italian goodies from raw food to canned goods! So much selections of pasta too which Italians are known for. This store is located at the prudential center and it's so convenient since there is a station right in the building. They have sale sometimes so I take that opportunity to buy something. They are a little bit pricey but the quality is worth it to buy if you are the type that invests in to something like this. They also have restaurants inside that you can sit and eat with friends, a gelato area and hug selection of wine which you can also enjoy while at the restaurant there. It's busy most of the time but when it's almost closing it gets a little less crowded. 
I always come back to this store so till next stop!"
776,86,Eataly Boston,1 star rating,10/6/2021,"Went over expecting a wow experience, first time over and last so far. The food was so dull, no color no flavor at all, lack of seasoning and so overpriced. For the location should make an effort on innovate."
777,87,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,4/7/2021,I love Eatly! I went to some great in-person events before the pandemic started and I've really enjoyed the virtual classes that they offer now. The virtual tiramisu class was very fun - they sent us the meal kit the day before and a lovely wine pairing. My mother and I are doing the terra dinner virtual class next. I also ate outside at their patio restaurant and they did a great job complying with all the safety measures.
778,88,Eataly Boston,4 star rating,6/17/2019,"We loved the Eataly in Chicago, so we decided to come to this one while visiting Boston. It's pretty much the same concept, with various stalls that serve gelato, seafood, meats, cheeses, etc.  It also serves as a grocery with fresh vegetables, pasta, etc.  

Prices are a little on the higher side, but not too egregious. I ended up purchasing some American wagyu coulette from the meat market here since there was a sale going on. Cooked these for dinner and they were excellent. Not as fatty as other wagyu I've had but still awesome. 

One big issue I had with this version of Eataly is that it's WAY too cramped. There's too many narrow pathways that lead to overcrowding, especially near the entrance."
779,89,Eataly Boston,2 star rating,1/31/2020,"I visited the location to find a wine new to Eataly USA. One of my friends is the producer and made a post saying that his wine was now available across all US stores, including Boston. 

The wine manager I spoke with when I arrived tonight said he had never heard of it, and was quite rude. He just didn't seem to care that I had come all the way into Boston to find this particular Italian wine, which is incredible. It's even featured on Eataly's website for Valentine's Day!

I was also a bit disappointed he didn't take down my name and gave me a call when/ if the wine should arrive.

Totally unpleasant experience here!"
780,0,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/18/2022,I lovee Bootleg!! The food is amazing especially the seafood! My boyfriend went for the first time with me on valentine day & he loves it (he's a very picky eater). The urban/culture low lighting setting gives off a romantic/private setting & we Loved it! Definitely try this place!!
781,1,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/24/2022,I will totally be back! Very nice place cozy and comfortable and excellent customer service.
782,2,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,4/5/2022,"Came here on a Sunday morning for a birthday brunch. Had the oysters, beignets, cornbread to start. Cornbread was ok (no one at the table loved the bits of corn in it). Oysters were perfection, as were the beignets.  Everyone at the table agreed the bootleg Benedict I ordered was some of the best they'd ever had- HIGHLY recommend. Strawberry soufflé pancakes were ok but very sweet (order for the table to share) French toast was good. Standout dish would be the garlic noodles also. We got a app but they have a dinner and brunch version I would 1000% get again. 
Ambiance and service were top notch and they even let us sit a little longer than our allotted time so be sure to watch you clock because it flies by! 

Their signature passion fruit mimosa was the fan favourite of the table also. I ordered a French 75 which was also done well!"
783,3,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,3/13/2022,"Last time I came here for brunch was years ago and I remember I had a good experience with good food. Came here again recently this time for dinner. Such a hip and trendy spot. It almost reminds me of a speakeasy because the outside is so lowkey and nothing special. But as soon as you walk in, the atmosphere is so lively and has lots of New Orleans-type vibes (which I think was the goal of the restaurant). 

We ordered a few plates to share including the squid ink fried rice, garlic noodles, lobster crab mac and cheese, and crispy wings. Everything was super tasty and we all enjoyed it, but it wasn't quite a ""WOW"" in my opinion. The fried rice, garlic noodles and mac and cheese are listed under ""social plates"" on the menu so I assumed it would be big enough for a group of 4 to share, but honestly I thought it was pretty small and seemed like it could be a portion for 1 person. The taste itself of each dish was really good, my favorite would probably be the squid ink fried rice, but overall as a whole the food wasn't anything to really rave about. 

Drinks were delicious. I had the mandarin mule and almond blossom. Just sweet enough for me! My boyfriend had the law of motion, and if you're looking for a super strong drink, get that one. Overall had a good experience here~ very trendy restaurant with excellent cocktails. I would come back agajn to re-try the brunch, and get more cocktails!!"
784,4,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/5/2022,"As others have commented, from the outside it looks like the restaurant is closed but once you go inside the decorations and interior design looks great. I made a reservation on Yelp for a Sunday night dinner with some friends.

For drinks we got the Buddhist Tooth (Japanese Whisky, Honey, and Soda), Mandarin mule (Vodka, Lime, and Ginger Beer), and a gin and tonic. The drinks were good and came out very photogenic.   

For appetizers, I would recommend the crispy wings with chili butter glaze, chicken under a brick pinchos (essentially chicken skewers), Thai basil garlic fries (comes with a really good creamy sauce) and easy street corn. Each of these dishes were fantastic. 

For sharable entrees, we got the signature garlic noodles with shrimp and the lobster-crab mac and cheese. The noodles were good, but I would not recommend adding the shrimp since we paid $8 to only get 4 pieces of shrimp. 

For dessert, we got to the five layer chocolate cake that came with chocolate hazelnut sauce and raspberries. Surprisingly, it wasn't super sweet and was more dark chocolate which I love. 

Overall, come here for good food and a great experience and feel like you've briefly teleported to Louisiana."
785,5,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/26/2022,"Really cool place with a unique vibe. Delicious Cajun style seafood! The other reviews that say ""it looks closed but it's open"" are 100% true. 

Visiting Boston, I knew seafood was a must. The quality and taste of the food at this restaurant blew me away! Huge portions. The signature sauce is great but very spicy (and messy!) 

The best way to describe this place is a restaurant that looks & sounds like a club. The lights are dim, the music is bumpin' and the drinks are strong. The artwork is definitely cool and the bar is nice. Would recommend for a date night or night out with friends (not really a family dinner kinda place). 

Only suggestion for this place would be to make it known that you're open for business. The outside is dull, dark and looks closed. If it weren't for Yelp I would not have found it."
786,6,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/24/2022,"We decided to go out for a weekday dinner and this was one of the few options available on a Monday night within a short ride of our hotel. We arrived to an inconspicuous looking building on a corner next to a CVS and immediately thought: this is a bar.
Until we opened the door. The restaurant is completely incongruous from the outside but on the inside, it's dark, moody, and very modern. Think a lot of metal, leather, and concrete. 

We were seated in the back next to a long curtain leading to the back- is there a club back there! We will never know. All I know is that there was an unfortunate draft coming through those curtains. 

We were very impressed by the menu and ordered a variety of small plates including the spicy scallop tacos, the steak tartare, the roast Brussels sprouts and cauliflower, the street corn and the garlic noodles. This is precisely how to experience this menu- try it ALL! We ran out of room before finishing the elote (street corn) buy everything was DELISH.

The garlic noodles were HOT, well seasoned and soothing. The steak tartare was perfectly medium rare, the sauce was Asian inspired and the crunch of the sesame seeds in the marinade completed the experience of each bite effortlessly. The elote was excellent and authentic. I loved every bite. The roasted veggies were crisp and well seasoned and not greasy, which was delightful.

Lest I forget- their wine pairings are PERFECTION. I had the California Pinot Noir and it paired to perfection with the steak and garlic noodles. My friend tried a sake and it was quite lovely with the scallops and elote. 

Though we were reaching the top at this point, we had to try dessert. The beignets AND the chocolate cake. We demolished the beignets, which were not QUITE as puffy and light as a Cafe du Monde beignet but WERE authentic, hot, well flavored (not sweet) and coated with just the right amount of powdered sugar to be delectable. We were exhausted and didn't want coffee but these would be ideal accompanied by some chicory coffee.

We took the chocolate cake to go but it was also delicious. Paired with fresh, ripe raspberries and espresso powder, it was THE PERFECT midnight snack lol."
787,7,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,12/8/2021,"We dined here because a coworker and I were in Boston on business. We searched Yelp for seafood places and this on came up. We were pleasantly surprised to see it was $1 Oyster Thursday night! I was excited.

The atmosphere was really cool. Pretty young crowd but all we cared about was the food. The oysters were Amazon!!! I had 2 platters of them! I should've ate that all night but since I'm a foodie I wanted to try some other things on the menu. 

I had the snow crab with potatoes and my coworker had the shrimp with potatoes. We both built our own boils.

My coworker was pleased with her shrimp. They were sweet and yummy. Both our potatoes weren't cooked all the way through. A lot of them were still uncooked. 

A lot of my crab legs had zero meat in them and that was frustrating since it was pretty pricey. I told my waiter but there wasn't much he could do about it. The meat that I did get was good. Our waiter was very attentive and suggested our drink choices. They were ok as well. I had the sangria. I think a white sangria would've paired better with the seafood.

I also had the beignets for dessert. I didn't take a picture because we forgot and we didn't like them. It's best just to eat them in New Orleans. 

Overall the seafood and service was good. Next time I'll just enjoy the Oysters and a nice beer. My tab alone was $100. Was it worth it? No. Especially since I wasn't able to enjoy my crab legs and potatoes..."
788,8,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/20/2022,"I came here for dinner and drinks with a friend on a Friday night. The outside of the restaurant is very unassuming, but the inside is really colorful and hip.

We started with ordering cocktails. I'm not the biggest cocktail person, but Bootleg Special seems like a restaurant where you order a cocktail. I had the Moral Fable, which was made with mezcal and blackberries. It was well-balanced with alcohol/flavor. For dinner, we decided to split a few small plates. We picked the twice cooked pork fillet, the squid ink fried rice, and the street corn. The pork fillet was good, but a bit dry in my opinion. The fried rice came with a few scallops, muscles, and calamari, but had a generous portion of rice. The street corn was my favorite; it was topped with Cotija cheese and chili cream, and was very flavorful. 

Our waitress was attentive throughout the dinner service and the other staff seemed very nice, too. My only gripe is that the music was so loud that it was difficult to hear the conversation at times, but I think it was just the vibe of the restaurant. I would definitely recommend Bootleg Special to anyone looking for a fun place to have dinner or drinks."
789,9,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/5/2022,"Oh my goodness!!!! I want to come back here every time I'm in Boston! I wanted to take my sister to a nice brunch and this place was recommended to us, and it did not disappoint! The portions, the flavor, the ambiance, the service. Everything was literally perfect! We wanted to try a little bit of everything so we did! Shrimp n Grits, crab legs, crab avocado toast?soufflé pancakes, oysters, and the drinks!!! It's making my mouth water thinking about it now lol"
790,10,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/30/2022,"Umm this place is bomb ! The decor is very is funky I love it. Staff was very nice. I love the ambiance of this place. Garlic noodles are a must try , I added shrimp they were so good. It's worth ordering two bowls of the noodles to fill you up. The cucumber salad was very light, but tasty. The oysters were great. This place was cool, def feeling the ambiance . Good spot to eat good and just vibe out. Enjoy!"
791,11,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"I found out this place had souffle pancakes a while ago but I never got to try it until recently. I came here with a friend on Sunday for brunch. We got there at 11AM, right when they opened, without a reservation (we had just made plans to come here the night before). They said they had no tables available but we gave them our name and phone number and they said they would text us if they had any cancellations or no-shows (they only reserve tables for 15 minutes past the reserved time). I guess someone cancelled or didn't show up to their reservation because we were able to get seated by around 11:20.

We sat at the bar and started off with drinks. I got the ""You Can't Sip With Us"" which was very fruity, sweet, and delicious. Then we ordered a build-a-bowl with just mussels and no add-ins, with the signature bootleg special sauce. The sauce was very garlicky and soooo good. If you love garlic, you'll love it. If you hate garlic, this is not the dish for you. It comes with a side of bread which you can dip in the sauce. 

We also ordered the souffle pancakes, the main reason I wanted to visit this place. We got the strawberries creme fraiche pancakes. It looked just like the pictures I'd seen online- no false advertising here! The pancakes were very light, fluffy, and the perfect amount of sweetness to balance out the garlic mussels we'd just eaten.

Overall I highly recommend this place and it is definitely worth the hype!"
792,12,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,11/6/2021,"Fun place! The exterior makes the place look closed but definitely not so! Like a restaurant meets club, and aesthetically pleasing. 
Very quick and friendly service. Large portions. 
Everything is delish! 
Cajun fried rice had a ton of flavor. Wish the crispy wings and octopus had more sauce - the more subtle flavors were washed out by the fried rice.  
Their seafood boil is very heavy on the garlic but so so good. Comes with 2 large slices of bread which is actually a really good idea for the sauce but like I said.  Huge portions.  

Would definitely recommend if you've never had a seafood boil before and not very fond of dipping things in butter (like me)."
793,13,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,10/31/2021,"My husband and I came here because we REALLY wanted seafood while we stayed in Boston.  We came in jeans and a t-shirt, and felt out of place when we walked inside.  The hostess was courteous towards us.  We did not have a reservation, but thankfully there were tables available.  

Our waitress was extremely nice.  She engaged in conversations with us, and made us feel welcome.  We ordered Mama Sue's ""Big Bowl of Crabs"" with classic garlic butter sauce, and it was pure heaven.  My husband and I didn't talk much during dinner because we were too busy cracking crab and eating.  We ate every single bite! This dinner was definitely the best we had when we stayed in Boston!"
794,14,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/25/2022,Would definitely recommend coming here for the boil!! It was delicious and super messy. I would recommend offering a bib because I definitely got very messy as I was elbow seem in crab. Really good drinks as well!
795,15,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,1/23/2022,"Came here for a weekend brunch and I was simply blown away by their SOUFFLE PANCAKES (banana foster). The pancakes are light and fluffy, akin to an angel-food-cake lightness. They're glazed with a delicious spiced rum and banana liquor sauce, and paired with fresh whipped cream.

I remember this place having a killer chicken sandwich. But sadly their brunch menu is a bit limited. Home Fries Au Gratin was a bit lackluster, with soggy home fries and barely melted cheese."
796,16,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"vibes: mardi gras speakeasy in a warehouse. Odd location and it looks closed from the outside, but honestly very cool from the inside. 

Food was 4/5 - We got the crab boil, which was contained all the usual suspects: corn, sausage, potatoes, crab, lobster, clams, crayfish.  It was intensely flavorful with a good heat. Beignets were also similar to ones in New Orleans. My one gripe is that the seafood boil is garlic HEAVY. I love garlic, but it got a little overpowering near the end, almost like I was taking shots of garlic. 

Service 5/5: the service was top notch. Our waitress noticed even the small things - like relighting the table candle, offering additional bread w our crab boil, or giving out mint-scented hot towels after eating."
797,17,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,3/19/2022,"I was excited to check out this place but I left with disappointment of their food. I came here for dinner with a Yelp reservation so I didn't have to wait long. The restaurant is totally different from its outside look. The inside has a cool club vibe. The waitress was nice and attentive. But here comes the disappointment. My friends ordered Cajun fried rice and big bowl of crabs. First, the coke zero was so flat. Second, the fried rice was super salty (I'm guessing too much Cajun seasoning). Third, the snow crab in the big bowl was not fresh (when I cracked the leg, the meat was only half of the leg). Next, the potatoes were just boiled separately and added on so they had no flavor. Last, the white rice ordered on the side was so over cooked and too wet. The only good part was the noodles and the bread comes with the big bowl. Overall, my expectations were not met and not worth with the price. I wouldn't recommend and definitely don't think that I will ever be back."
798,18,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/30/2022,"Amazing ambience, friendly staff and tasty food.
I highly recommend it! Just excellent!!"
799,19,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/27/2022,"AMAZING. I had my 21st birthday brunch here & I loved it. It's a vibe in there, the decor is beautiful & the food was pretty good. I had the lobster Mac & cheese which was 10/10 and the strawberry fluffy pancakes which were OKAY, since they're so airy it kinda felt like I was eating nothing.... But besides that it was fine. 
They had an amazing birthday platter that the table beside me ordered for me, the drinks were bomb & the leprechaun cereal drink was super strong with baileys!! The service was awesome as well!! The servers were so nice, always came to refill our water and make sure our food was good. They let us take our time when ordering & we stayed there for a few hours just talking, eating, and enjoying the vibes!! This is def a diamond & must try!!! So pretty."
800,20,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/26/2022,"Bootleg Special is THE place for a hip, trendy, filling dinner. I booked a table for a large party here for my birthday after seeing another Yelp review about a lucky charms cocktail (which they sadly didn't serve during dinnertime). 

The food? BOMB. The drinks? SNATCHED. The lobster? BOILED. The noodles? GARLICKED. The grilled octopus? NEVER HAD OCTOPUS THIS SOFT BEFORE. Lobster mac and cheese? Crispy, creamy, cheesy. Me after this dinner???? Completely deceased. 

Honestly, coming into this dinner, I had only done research into the cocktails, which were so yummy and giant. I had no idea that my friends and I would leave so content and full, nor did I know that a Cajun restaurant this hip and delicious existed in Boston. I'd definitely come back to Bootleg to eat (and drink) again."
801,21,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,9/11/2021,"Ambiance: 2.5/5
From the outside, the restaurant looked closed. My family and I hesitated before opening the door. As we stepped inside to enter, the music was loud and the dining area was dark. It was difficult to see anything. 

Food: 3/5
- Mama Sue's Crab ($185)-- my family liked it. Too oily for my taste buds.
- Oyster 25 ($25)-- we all enjoyed it!
- Garlic Noodles ($10)-- flavorful. Couldn't get enough of it.
- Thai Basil Fries 2 ($10ea)-- yummy!
- Lobster Mac Cheese ($18)-- sons liked it.
- Cajun Fried Rice ($13)-- tasty.
- Side Sauce ($3)

802,22,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,8/14/2021,"Lobster Mac & Cheese 7/10: it was okay and edible. I definitely had better. The Mac and cheese needed a bit more seasoning as well as cheese. The seafood taste over powered the cheese taste, and it was a tad bit watery at the bottom due to the steamed lobster in it. Do not recommend.

Yellow Tail Special 10/10: this drink was amazing and got the job done. I love cognac, in particular, Dusse, and this was a well created cocktail. The drink was a bit pricey at $16 but it's all top shelf liquor. 

I would come to this place strictly for the drinks and maybe a few appetizers, which are a shareable size. I'm a lil iffy about the seafood boils and other seafood options. This is suppose to be a ""New Orleans"" cuisine restaurant, but if you have experienced real creole food then don't expect that from this place."
803,23,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,1/14/2022,"Decided to come here again for my friend's birthday dinner and it was an amazing night. Our waitress named Brittney was super sweet and attentive the whole night and made the experience very enjoyable for my friends and I. The food did fall a little flat from when we were here last time. I had high expectations for the lobster mac and cheese and was disappointed with how bland it tasted. 

Nonetheless the presentation of the food and atmosphere made up for it. My only complaint is that they should add more items to the menu, there isn't a lot of options to choose from. I hope in the near future they add more items."
804,24,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,8/31/2021,"After looking for a seafood restaurant, we came across Bootleg and made reservations which I'm glad we did since it was packed when we arrived. 

I must've drove around the block for a good 15minutes trying to find parking or legal parking lot. I finally lucked up and parked down the street by the traffic light. I was u sure about a designated parking lot and being from out of state, I didn't want to take a chance. 

We had 9:30 pm reservations and I did see tables set up for outside dining but it had been raining that evening. I was initially skeptical because it looked like it was closed from the outside but when you open the door you entered into a dim lite space and are immediately greeted by the host. The host was kind and friendly and informed us that he was waiting to clean a table and would seat us immediately. 

Once seated we were immediately greeted by our waitress who was wearing her mask and who took our drink orders and returned shortly. A clockwork yellow was really good and really strong  didn't taste the teaches peaches but heard it was tasty and good as well. 

We ordered the build your own boil with crab legs, lobster, corn and potatoes. You have to request corn and potatoes if you want them in your boil. We ordered the bootleg sauce as well as a side of garlic butter. Prior to our food arriving we received 2 slices of toasted bread for us to soak up the seafood juices that were very tasty. The crab legs were fresh and seasoned perfectly, the corn was sweet and fresh as well, I wanted at least 2 more pieces of corn it was so good. The potatoes were small and ok. We didn't receive the garlic butter we asked for until midway through our meal but she also didn't charge us for it, it wasn't tasty either so I'm glad. The lobster also had good flavor and wasn't rubbery. 

Inside was dim lighting and didn't appear to be all that much seating."
805,25,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"We came Halloween weekend and they had decked the whole place out! Loved the atmosphere. The drinks were great! The crab legs were well worth it too!

806,26,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,11/12/2021,"I would not have expected to find this homage to NOLA on a random Boston corner, but thank you internet, that's exactly what happened. The raw oyster special was fresh and reminded me of the ocean. The street corn was a fun experience, but would have benefited from a juicier corn. The mac and cheese was good, as anything with lobster is. The desserts amazing though, excellent way to end the meal. The aesthetic was a little hard to see in the dark, but it definitely felt like a New Orleans bar!"
807,27,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,7/17/2021,"This is where you can enjoy your boil without being messy. They serve the meal on a plate rather than having you fish them through a bag.

We ordered the crawfish with their signature sauce, mussels with garlic/butter, and Cajun fried rice. Oh, the Cajun fried rice was so crispy and seasoned so well. Both the boil dishes were delicious.

Drink-wise, try the Teaches of Peaches - it is a strong tasty drink. For dessert, definitely try the cheesecake...it was better than the chocolate cake.

The service was excellent, and our server was very accommodating with one of our friends with gluten-free needs (sauce on the side). 

Highly recommended if you are in the area"

While visiting last week we revisited @bootlegspecial. I was craving a seafood boil so of course we had to revisit. This restaurant has such a spunky and eccentric decor and definitely sets the mood for date night. 

Located across the bridge from the theatre district downtown, @boss is a great place to grab dinner before a fun night on the town. 

I love how they took their own spin on the traditional seafood boil, as you can tell from the picture it was so flavorful and delicious. 

 Foodie Rating :  out of 5 

Pros: 
Close to downtown , walking distance from theatre district. 
Great small plate selection (octopus + oysters  )
Ideal date night location
Offers brunch on Saturday and Sunday ft. boozy cereal  

Cons: 
Popular location : reservations suggested 
$$$ splurging happens easily
Dimly lit bad for photos
Only 1 location

810,30,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,5/8/2021,"Came as a party of four -- made a reservation for a Saturday evening and it was PACKED. Even had tables right next to each other indoors, which made me a little nervous given COVID.

Ordered The Bootleg Special and Lobster & Crab Mac and Cheese for the table. Was the perfect amount for four! 

The Lobster & Crab Mac and Cheese was amazing with chunks of lobster and crab throughout -- they did not skimp out!! 

The Bootleg Special we ordered with their house sauce, which has a bit of a kick. The crawfish were the same size as our shrimp and had tiny amounts of meat. The lobster was amazing and was already cut in half with shell partially broken for us to easily eat. We were also given little plastic gloves to eat without getting our hands dirty. 

The drink that I got -- ""You Can't Sip With Us"" -- tasted a bit like medicine/ Gatorade. Wouldn't recommend this particular drink, but the food is good!"

813,33,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,1/13/2022,"The interior and ambiance really did make you feel like you were in NOLA. The service was wonderful and the complimentary bread went well with the juices from the seafood boil. As for the seafood boil, the lobster, crawfish, and shrimp tasted wonderful. However, I think the mussels were old since they left a really strong sea-like aftertaste. I've personally never had a problem with fishy smells/aftertaste but the mussels here were a little too unbearable for me to eat. For the flavoring of the seafood boil my friends and I got the Signature Bootleg. It tasted amazing, however, you might want to bring some gum or mints since the amount of garlic they use is astounding. Overall, I think this restaurant was a fun girls night out!"
814,34,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,11/3/2021,"Absolutely loved our experience here. Their Halloween decorations were awesome and the overall ambiance of the restaurant was great. Our waitress was fantastic and answered all of our questions. 

We ordered the Easy Street Corn, Thai Basil Garlic Fries, and Blackened Ribeye Tips. We loved each plate but if you only get one of these, go for the Easy Street Corn -- it was SO good. The Ribeye Tips were fatty but tender and delicious and the Thai Basil Garlic Fries were super flavorful.

We ordered the Mandarin Mule and Rum Rhapsody for drinks. Highly recommend trying the Mandarin Mule.

We also got the 5 Layer Chocolate Cake for dessert. This is a MUST. It was so rich, chocolatey, and delicious. Perfect way to end the night."
815,35,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,1/29/2022,"Went here for bfast. This place seems like a speakeasy on the outside, but on the inside it is very strange - it's a huge warehouse with strange decor that isn't particularly cozy or cool. However, the food is great. We went for brunch and got amazing cocktails - you have to get the boozy cereal leprechaun's trap is delicious (more of a drink than a food item). The soufflé pancakes are delicious! I wish they had a more expansive menu of breakfast food at brunch at brunch because the food we did order was great."
816,36,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,3/30/2021,"I came here for a Saturday brunch (3/27), hostess' attitude was such a bummer. They should really consider someone more welcoming for the face of the restaurant. 

Ambiance is great, super pretty, trendy and Covid friendly! The drinks were tasty and strong but the food fell short for me. We ordered a few apps - Oysters were okay and scallion tacos were good. Lobster Mac and cheese was a hard pass for me and the rib eye lacked seasoning. For the pricing, I expected the food to be better. We decided to opt out on entrees but did try the beignets- wasn't a fan. Service was good, food came out pretty quick. 

Unfortunately, I don't think the ambiance and drinks are worth returning for."
817,37,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,4/25/2021,"Heard really good things about this place from my friends so I had to give it a try.

It was my cousin's birthday so I decided to get two seafood boil of my choice. First tray was just 2-3 orders of mussels with sausage, corn, potatoes and a side order of their garlic noodles (amazing!). The mussels were great and we loved the sauce ( paid $3-4 more for extra sauce) . 

Second tray, this is when things took a turn LOL I got crab legs and CRAWFISH. Assuming the crawfish should be good if I'm paying $15-16 dollar a pound for it. Let's start off with the crab legs. The crab legs seemed fresh so that was good. The meat paired with their extra spicy sauce was amazing. I added sausage and garlic noodles to the boil. I did not know they were going to put the noodles in the tray . Thought it would be on the side . Moving on to the crawfish.....

There were probably 18-24 crawfish in this tray. Not kidding , half were horrible. The meat was MUSHY and BLACK. As you can see by the pictures I took, yeah we were not happy LOL the tray itself costed like $70. We were so disappointed ... 

I would give it two stars but upon arrival, the hostess was super nice and helpful. First time actually being inside, the set up was nice. Very nice and cozy."
818,38,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/17/2022,"Bootleg special is such a gem. Hands down my favorite place to eat - my go to dishes and must trys are the garlic noodles, bootleg seafood boil, crispy octopus and lobster Mac and cheese. For dessert, finish off with some Macarons and beignets. They are so good! 

Brunch is also to die for! Try their cornbread, bootleg Benedict, and soufflé pancakes - best I've ever had! 

This place is just an overall great place to hang out - delicious food, drinks, music, ambiance - what more can you ask for. I highly recommend!!!"
819,39,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/20/2022,"I have eaten at the restaurant multiple times and ordered it via Uber eats many times as well.  From the fantastic service to the quality of the food you can NOT be dissatisfied with Bootleg special.  The garlic noodles with shrimp is their signature along with the sirloin truffle steak.  The flavors work.  When I dine inside the restaurant I am amazed by the attention to detail, the vibe inside, and the quality of the staff.  Located on the south end/back bay line, this is a definite must for a bite to eat or simply a cocktail!  5 stars all the way.  Oh, before I forget, the boil is delicious!!!"
820,40,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/29/2022,"Think butter, garlic heaven! 

I wouldn't recommend going here on date night cos things get messy! 

We ordered the garlic noodles which were great, the garlic basil fries, spicy scallop tacos and the boil with lobster with the signature bootleg sauce. 

The cocktails are really good too and the vibe is fun."
821,41,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/27/2022,"I had reservations at 4:45 and had gotten finished with my shopping earlier and walked in and they sat me as I was a party of one. The hospitality and ambience is amazing. To say nothing of the food which is so tasteful, and reasonably priced. Shrimp and grits were amazing. I can't wait to come back To enjoy one of the Cajun boil's."
822,42,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,9/27/2021,"I'm usually not one to go back multiple times to a restuarant, but this place is definitely the exception. I've come here for their specialty japanese fluffy pancakes, which are always amazing, and this time I came back to try some of their savoury options, which did not disappoint in the slightest. We got the shrimp and grits, as well as the garlic noodles and the crushed cucumber salad. The shrimp and grits were creamy and cheesy, perfectly balanced out by the corn and tomatoes it was served with. The garlic noodes were a simple 12/10. And the cucumber salad was the perfect fresh and acidic complement to the two main dishes. If that wasn't all, the service is always great. Will be coming back for sure."
823,43,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,2/11/2022,"We had planned a birthday dinner and you don't want to go anywhere on a Friday night without reservations.

I was surprised by the atmosphere. Very club like. In a very cool way. The light and music, the deco, the entire place is very cool.

Our server was amazing! On top of food and drinks and very accommodating.

The food was outstanding. The chicken sausage gumbo poutine was out of this world. The seafood boil perfect! And the beignets just like in good old New Orleans. Absolutely delicious!

Perfect spot for a celebration with great friends or a cool family."
824,44,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,2/15/2022,"Fiancé and I Decided to celebrate my 11th birthday  at this restaurant, We are big foodies just look at my belly and you can tell.  We started with Small plates of Crispy wings and the spicy scallop Taco Asiático, Let me tell once my  taste buds tasted these wings they wanted more, The sauce and crispy ness and the thick wings were perfection evenly crispy, The Tacos were great the scallop's and the tortillas chile lime green had a perfect balance, We also had Piña coladas for drinks. The creamy and pineapple with alcohol were a great blend, For our dinners We had the bootleg social with mussels. I had the lobster Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was okay needs more flavor I also had aside of shrimp  sautéed with butter that was great and fresh. Overall this place is amazing the interior designer deserves the greatest of recognition. The industrial look with a hint of chandeliers I felt that.  The only issue is parking you may have to walk.  We will be back for brunch !!!"

826,46,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,8/28/2021,"This place was excellent! The service was excellent and I loved the inside and ambiance of the restaurant. They did have outside seating but I needed to see the inside.  And the food...omg the food was superb! I didn't finish, had lots of leftovers. Definitely worth the price and I highly recommend!"
827,47,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/3/2022,Portion was tiny BUT very tasty. Would recommend getting a side order of potatoes if you have an appetite. There was definitely a considerable portion of lobster and the sauce they use was spicy.
828,48,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,6/26/2021,"Another absolute 5 star restaurant! The brunch experience here exceeded my expectations!
Service: we reserved an outdoor table and brought our dog. The server was very considerate and brought us a bowl of water for the dog. She was attentive and very nice.
Food: we ordered lobster Benedict, crab avocado toast, soufflé pancakes and maple pecan beignet. I recommend all of them! Def unique Cajun seafood style brunch items!
Lobster Benedict def have lots of Cajun seasoning! The bread is soaked in the flavorful sauce and poached egges were cooked to perfection! 
Crab avocado toast was HUGE! Fresh crab meat on top of generous amount of freshly cut avocado on top of thick brioche toast! Best avocado toast I've ever had! It doesn't come with eggs but you can add extra poached eggs with it!
Loved the beignet! Super fluffy! The fried dough itself is not sweet. The sweetness comes from the powdered sugar. Maple pecan beignet is just classic beignet with a giant scoop of maple pecan icecream. Def a very generous portion of dessert. I'd say if you decided to order it, def save some room for these tasty guys!!

Will come back to try their dinner seafood boils!!"
829,49,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,8/12/2021,"Awesome complete dining experience. Our server Blue was great and very attentive our drinks we were able to get the virgin version, and we enjoyedThe colossal crab and clams we're special. We also really liked the basil and garlic fries. Now the strawberry cheesecake put us over the top. Worth the price!!!"
830,50,Bootleg Special,1 star rating,12/4/2021,"I have been here in person and really enjoyed the food at atmosphere. Last week I ordered delivery through UberEats and received crab legs with parasites on them.  Fortunately enough with the help of Uber I received a full refund for my order. I was concerned that the food was chosen, cooked, packaged and sent to me and no one noticed or cared to remove it. Both clusters were infested. I will likely never eat here again."
831,51,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/2/2022,The fried rice & seafood boil was 10/10. The oysters which were fresh and yummy! One of my favorite date night spots!
832,52,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,7/25/2021,"Been here once long time ago for dinner and had really good impression. Came here for a brunch and it didn't disappoint. The lobster and crab Benedict was delicious, so were the garlic noodles, Brussels sprouts and the ribeye tips that was very juicy. Good atmosphere too, slightly on the loud side."
833,53,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/28/2022,"We ate here tonight and had the scallop tacos, crispy octopus and the squid ink fried rice! Everything was delicious and we ordered a second crispy octopus!"
834,54,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,11/17/2020,"**ordered via UberEats**
It was my friend's birthday and due to covid we decided to treat ourselves with takeout. We were feeling seafood and came across Bootleg Special and the photos and menu items looked tempting. We were not sure of how much food we were going to receive so went all out and got the bootleg special with garlic noodles and garlic fries and then also got the traditional beignets for dessert. We will realize later that this is a feast for many and not two but hey, no regrets!

OMG - if you like seafood and garlic then you're in for a treat! The bootleg special has a mix of all types of seafood and you can pick the sauce and sides it's made in. I picked Cajun sauce and went with potatoes and noodles. The garlic was overwhelming but since we both a fans, we did not mind. The restaurant added some gloves that we were thankful for because we definitely needed those. 

The noodles and garlic fries are a must try! Again, we did not bother with utensils and dug in. The food came with what seemed like garlic bread. Given the amount of food, I'll probably skip out on any sides. 

The beignets were freshly fried and were soft and smelled amazing. Unfortunately we did not have space to indulge in them, so we had them for breakfast the next day. Still a scrumptious experience. It is a little on the pricey side, but you're getting a whole lotta seafood. 

Lots of leftover, lots of fun and overall a very ""hands on experience"". Would definitely order again from the regular menu."
835,55,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,11/29/2021,"I loved Bootleg Special! My boyfriend and I grabbed dinner and drinks here on a rainy Friday evening. The exterior of the place looks v sus, but once you step inside, the atmosphere and decor are on point. The host/hostesses are super nice and the waitstaff are great. The cocktails were delicious and the food did not disappoint. We ordered the avocado rojo oysters, cajun fried rice, garlic noodles, and the tenderloin. Everything was fantastic. It wasn't busy when we got there around 7:00pm, but the place started filling up around 8:00/8:30. I'd definitely recommend grabbing a reservation, if you can. Can't wait to come back here, maybe to check out their brunch menu :)"
836,56,Bootleg Special,3 star rating,5/17/2021,"Four friends and I visited on a Saturday morning for brunch and were extremely lucky to have gotten a table, especially with our party size. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but the ambience was much better inside. 

A friend and I shared the Bootleg Benedict and the Strawberries & Cream Soufflé Pancakes. The benedict was delicious but extremely salty. Both of us drank an obscene amount of water to compensate, making us fuller than needed. The pancakes were quite average, with nothing particularly special about them. 

Although the food wasn't the most memorable, one thing I really appreciated was the service. Our waiter was extremely accommodating and didn't charge us the usually gratuity that usually applies for parties of five or more."
837,57,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,6/4/2021,"Highly suggest the $1 oysters on Thursday! The bartenders are great. The choice of hand crafted cocktails is wonderful. Atmosphere is a fun vibe, with chill music and amazing artwork! A must find when  you come to Boston."
838,58,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,11/23/2021,"This is a spot I love bringing visitors to. They usually have a lot of reservations open and the Cajun boils they have are consistent and so yummy! I always do the bootleg sauce and have tried a variety of the seafood available in the boil. My reco would be to get shrimp and lobster for the boil with corn added. I'm not a fan of the sausage they have - there must be an herb in it I don't like that much that is very strong, maybe marjoram? Anyway I'd skip the sausage but would definitely add corn and get a side of rice. I also really love the garlic noodles! And for drinks the banana one they have is my favorite. Will continue to come back for a special meal when I have visitors."
839,59,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,12/5/2021,"Came a second time since we really enjoyed our first visit. Had a build a boil, crushed cucumber and my favorite ceviche oysters. And topped it with 5 layer chocolate cake. All great and good service."
840,60,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,11/22/2021,"LOVED this place! I was skeptical because we only went here because our top choices were fully booked for brunch on a Saturday. This place had an available reservation, so we decided to go. So glad we did! Our waitress was phenomenal. The wings were ""perfectly cooked"" (my bf's words) crispy and slightly spicy. My Bootleg Benedict (lobster, crab, and a spicy sauce) was excellent and so were the souffle pancakes. Mimosas kept coming, and the cocktails were great too. Decor was beautiful, even the walk to the bathroom was interestingly decorated. Would definitely go back."
841,61,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,4/1/2022,"We went to this restaurant before COVID and had such a great time. It is very hard to find the door, and we were not sure when we stumbled upon it. There are quite a number of stairs down to the restaurant. But the services were warm and friendly. The food choices were fun and very southern. And we greatly enjoyed the environment as well as the food. I would recommend getting one of the boils - nothing like a table covered in newspaper and scattered with shellfish, corn, and potatoes. Great fun. We will definitely go back again."
842,62,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/10/2022,"Amazing food, drink and service. While a bit pricey, I can't think of a better place to experience seafood Boston / Cajun style."
843,63,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,2/5/2022,Doesn't look like much when you walk past it and it's kind of hard to find in Chinatown but I did appreciate a place that had beignets. I'm from California so I really depending on Disneyland to provide amazing new orlean style beignets but I thought this place did a pretty good job with the dessert menu. Food was really good as well. Ordered garlic noodles and it was so aromatic and filling. It's a really great place to hang with friends if you want a good atmosphere and vibes for the evening.
844,64,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,3/23/2022,"This food was amazing! It was a pleasant surprise to be in a majority-POC space, and an even better surprise with the delicious food. The atmosphere and the decor was so lively even though I was there at 12 pm. I ordered the fluffy pancakes, and the cajun mix with clams, shrimp, and sausage. There was a solid amount in there and I recommend splitting it with another person to finish it! It was my first time eating the viral fluffy pancakes, and this was the perfect place to try them! However, I do like the other dipping more than the creme brulee one. The cajun was nicely seasoned with a little kick of spice, so I ordered a side of white rice to calm the heat down a little bit. I will definitely come back here again! We need more places like this in the Boston area."
845,65,Bootleg Special,2 star rating,11/30/2021,Wouldn't go here for brunch. Waste of time- not a lot of choices ended up basically ordering what I would eat for a normal night out..... only good thing is the drinks
846,66,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,5/2/2021,"I had a great time here! Beautiful interior, great service, and delicious food. We booked reservations in advance and were immediately seated. They had hand sanitizer available at the front and all staff wearing masks. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. The drinks and food were all delicious! We tried the bananas foster soufflé pancakes, garlic noodles with shrimp, and gumbo poutine. We loved everything we got and the portion sides were good too. The food came out pretty quickly. We had a wonderful time here and I would definitely recommend trying this place out."
847,67,Bootleg Special,2 star rating,9/19/2021,"I went to Bootleg Special for lunch with a colleague.  We were greeted by the host looking down his nose at us and asking if we had a reservation (we didn't).  Lacking a reservation, we were advised to take a seat at the bar.  There were three small tables open in the dining room.

Having navigated the first obstacle to an enjoyable lunch, we sat down and encountered the second.  Bootleg doesn't have printed menus; instead, you're expected to scan a QR code with your phone, which links to the restaurant's website.  The website has a poorly scanned image of -- you guessed it: a printed menu! -- meaning you have to repeatedly pan around the image, zooming in and out to figure out what you want.  As you can imagine, this is tedious and annoying.

After a couple of minutes the bartender took our orders.  My colleague ordered shrimp and grits, while I ordered a ""jumbo"" shrimp boil with corn (jumbo is in quotes for a reason: they weren't).  The bartender asked me if I wanted the kitchen to remove the shrimp heads, to which I responded, ""Sure, that'd be great.""  Remember this; it's going to come up again.

My colleague's meal arrived in just a few minutes.  Mine, well, not so much.  He was half done before mine appeared.  We both thought the food was decent but unremarkable.  My boil sauce had good flavor but was extremely salty.

When the bill arrived, I had been charged $6.00 to decapitate my shrimp!  No mention of this charge was made when I ordered, but they stuck it on the bill anyway.  In my view, this is utterly egregious.  If a restaurant wants to add charges like this, they need to advise their customers.  Not doing so is unconscionable.

Finally, the ambiance, if you can call it that, is punishing.  Bootleg is a cavernous room full of hard surfaces, which is overwhelmed with very loud music.  It would be charitable to say that having a conversation is difficult.

If you're dying for Cajun food then Bootleg Special has you covered, but prepare to pay for it in more ways than one."
848,68,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,2/16/2022,"Great ambience, excellent food! Cocktails were pretty good too! Garlic noodles def try"
849,69,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,8/20/2021,"The outside of the restaurant is very misleading. Reason why I say that is because, the entrance has the appearance that the restaurant permanently has closed for business. But when you proceed to enter the building, you walk into a beautiful jazzy looking lounge. Immediately, we were greeted and lead to our seats. The waitress was very nice and explained everything, on the menu that we had questions about. As I sit here thinking about how to write this review. I decided to just be as simple as possible. If I was to explain everything in detail, it would be waaay to long. So here I go.. Bootleg is a bit pricey, you'll notice that right away. But you will soon realize, every penny spent was well worth it. The quality and the quantity of the entree's was huge. Every dish (Build your own, momma sue boil, garlic noodles and shrimp, and scallop tacos) ordered was delicious. The complimentary bread provided was great for sauce dipping. I wouldve liked a little less garlic in the entree's though. I would come back here"
850,70,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,3/6/2021,Delish!!! We had the garlic noodles with shrimp as an appetizer and it was to die for! I am impressed! Out waitress was very nice and the guests were friendly!

The food was also pretty good! We ordered a lot of small plates to share as well as a custom seafood boil. Personally, the seafood boil was pretty average to me and nothing special but the garlic noodles, the chicken wings, and the Mac and cheese were delicious! I definitely recommend coming here with a group to order a bunch of sharing items."
852,72,Bootleg Special,2 star rating,8/28/2021,"Thanks to TikTok & Yelp - I thought this would be a dope spot to check out while staying in Boston for the weekend. Dishes looked well proportioned, vibe was cool, etc. 

Walking in - aesthetically pleasing. Speakeasy vibes. 
Service - good. Waitress was cool. 
Food - IF YOU ARE HUNGRY THIS AINT THE SPOT.
If ya coming to just catch up and kick it w/friends, chat over some food. This is for could be for you. The dishes were super small compared to what I viewed online. The food did NOTHING for my appetite. We ordered 'social plates' // grilled octopus, easy street corn, & lobster/crab mac. Don't get me wrong everything ordered was good. Just didn't even make a dent in either of our appetites. 

So in all I have 2 stars cause it was alright. 
Wasn't as hyped as the internet made it seem."

Hell, I looked at the next table and considered licking their plate, but you know, COVID... and decorum. We had the bootleg eggs Benedict and it was the most amazing thing ever. The bananas foster soufflé pancakes were just as good. 

This place is a must go to..."
855,75,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,4/19/2021,This place is really cool. Definitely a younger and hipper vibe but still enjoyable. The music was a bit loud and our food came out in the wrong order. The soufflé pancakes are okay but it's something you can make at home. The egg Benedict was superb.

857,77,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,9/19/2021,"So this was the 2nd place I was brought to celebrate my birthday and let me tell you - I loved it! From the outside, this looks like an ""inactive"" hole-in-the-wall type of place. I even wondered if they were open. The magic is inside!
Once I walked in, I was quite surprised, decor is very New Orleans-ish - they even have what I think is a ""pretend balcony"" a la NOLA.  
Full bar + seating tables. 
The music was on point. Each bathroom has its own speaker, feeling like you're in your own club in there ( try it). 
From what I 've seen, good for ladies or date nights. 

Why 4 stars you say?
The food was wayyyy too salty and garlicky for me! 
Parking can be difficult to find so plan an extra 30 mins to drive around to park your car if you're driving."
858,78,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,4/12/2021,Street corn was delicious! Must try. The garlic fries were ok very thin not so flavorful. The beignets were pretty big and was alright. Not enough powdered sugar lol the drinks here were ok too. The bayou was good and the you can't sip with us drink was ok. The music was a bit all over the place which made it a bit confusing to determine a mood/vibe. Definitely NOLA feels with the set up of the restaurant.
859,79,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,1/29/2022,Nice ambiance great for a sexy date night. Although the garlic noodles will have your breath smelling for days! (Still to die for lol) if you don't like spice don't get the sausage.. the seasoning for the boil is pretty chunky as opposed to being more saucy. Overall good place to satisfy your seafood boil cravings. PARKING SUCKS THO.

The only thing good was the pineapple mojito."
861,81,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,8/30/2021,"Boston town was booked at most places that were recommended to us so this was a pick from Yelp. A great find as the small plates were so delicious!

The drinks were delicious and although our server forget the our entire order minus the oysters- we didn't mind! We continued to order more rounds of oysters because we thought our food was coming. We still salivate at the thought of the oysters.. it has quickly become a regular stop for us while in Boston! We have since experienced the rest of their menu over countless seasons and they never disappoint! Most recently, we have fallen for the Birria Bao and Garlic Noodles with Shrimp! Obsessed. Highly recommend!"
863,83,Bootleg Special,2 star rating,2/5/2022,"READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU GO ......

3 margaritas each for a party of 2 ; oysters + appetizers
( oysters come with 3 per order )

The first set of drinks were 80% ice ; when we asked for less ice with the second order , the drinks came half way full ! Disappointing ....:

One boil a person for dinner totaling a $500.00 TAB

The corn on the cob was still frozen and the garlic was overpowering the crab /lobster .

Atmosphere was nice and yet also empty but for $500 ( without tip ) you could afford to fly to New Orleans round trip and enjoy the real atmosphere they're trying to replicate. You can also book a overnight stay at a hotel while there for the amount of the tip on a $500 tab . 

So not worth it and that is why they're empty ...."
864,84,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,8/18/2021,"my husband and i had Saturday brunch here recently and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  we ordered a variety of items, all to share, and each were excellent.

we started with the crawfish fried rice, which turned out to be our favorite dish.  it was very well-seasoned and had spice, but wasn't too spicy.  it was expertly fried, and the egg absorbed a lot of the flavor- those were some of my favorite bites.

next up we had the homefries au gratin, and the shrimp and grits.  the homefries were the weakest dish, although the potatoes were well cooked and hot, they were lacking the seasoning that was so delightful in the fried rice.  the shrimp and grits, on the other hand, were perfection.  so creamy and luscious, and the shrimp were cooked beautifully, not at all overdone.  i could have eaten several servings of the grits by themselves.

last up for ""dessert"" were the bananas foster souffle pancakes.  oh my!  the texture is so light and fluffy- these really are a treat.  the fresh banana was a welcome counterpoint to the decadent sauce, and the lightly-sweetened fresh whipped cream brought everything together.

we sat at the bar and had a wonderful experience with our 'tender (Blue- like the color), but really all the staff we encountered were friendly and seemed to appreciate our presence during the bustling service.

if you're in the mood for Cajun, or just really good brunch, i highly recommend Bootleg Special."
865,85,Bootleg Special,4 star rating,1/14/2021,"This place is truly special just as the name suggests. This hidden gem, is a corner restaurant filled with amazing seafood broil. My friends and I walked in, this place is spacious with a young, chill atmosphere with graffiti paintings on the wall. Surprised that it wasn't as packed as it was. Tables spaced out approximate for covid. Service was fantastic, service wasn't too overbearing but wasn't ghostly, just the right amount of attention. I was a huge fan of their oysters, price was reasonable and oysters were extremely fresh!"
866,86,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,1/12/2021,"The ""BOOTLEG SPECIAL"" - 1 1/4 lb Lobster, 1/2 lb each shrimp, crawfish, mussels, clams, corn on the cob, potatoes, andouille sausage (serves 2-3)
 $89
Garlic Noodles + shrimp -  $9 + $6
Street Corn -  $10
B.S. Wings -  $12

So I've literally been dying to try this place!! I love Louisiana so I had to stop by because of the theme. The urban décor was adorable! The ""bootleg special"" was such a huge portion that filled me up immediately. You also have the option to build your own boil. Everything was so tasty & flavorful!! I also had their garlic noodles & street corn, which are perfect for appetizers. The garlic noodles are legit amazing. I love garlic, so I definitely understand why it's a signature dish. This dish is packed with garlic & lots of butter. I just wish the portion size was bigger, but I enjoyed it regardless.

The street corn is delicious, but more spice would've really given that kick! The wings are crispy & tasty! They're covered with this type of Korean sauce, so if you're into that you should try them.

From the outside, you would never guess the appearance of the interior. I always appreciate the vintage wall art. They have different types of music playing in the background, while there are projectors showing video clips or sports games. It's just an all around nice vibe. Can't wait to come back for brunch!

Parking: Street metered parking - not busy on the weekdays

COVID-19 Safety Precautions: Distance between tables, staff wore masks & had cleaning protocol."

We ordered the seafood boil and added other items to it! The food was fresh and delicious. It was a birthday and dessert came out with a candle on it! It was a great Sunday lunch!"
868,88,Bootleg Special,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"OMG.  Finally got to try this place and it was so worth it.  I was in such a happy place dining at Bootleg Special.  Everything we had was amazing... it was well worth the garlic burps I had all day after. Lol.  You can order their boil or go a la carte, which is what we did cause we didn't want the fillers like corn and potatoes.  Since we only ordered snow crab legs, clams, and mussels, it also brought the price down.  The seafood boil was flavorful and the bootleg sauce had just the right amount of kick to it.  I didn't think poutine could get any better but wait, you add gumbo!  The garlic noodles seem simple but is full of flavor.  Until I can get back to NOLA, this will be my spot.  So looking forward to going back to try the soufflé pancakes and beignets."

We ordered two plates of the Black Truffle Ravoli, Scampi, and Salmon. We also ordered some wine, too. The food was super tasty with a lot of flavor and the price wasn't too bad either. I would definitely come back again for the food and to try more wine flights."

The wine flight was perfect for me since I could try a few sips of 3 different wines rather than having to commit to one glass of a wine I may or may not like, and in my opinion it was a good deal. 

The pasta dish was also really good. I was craving pesto and this hit the spot for sure!"

4,4,Piattini,2 star rating,10/25/2021,"I was really looking forward to enjoying this restaurant, but unfortunately the environment completely overshadowed the food. We decided to wait 45 minutes on the waitlist and we were seated outside on the sidewalk. It was a lovely area and felt nice at first, but we were left sitting in the cold for over an hour waiting for our food! The temperature was in the high 40s and dropping, and we didn't have a heater near our table. I understand that their kitchen may be backed up, but an extra heater for the tables around us is definitely doable. The minute we finished our meal, our waiter came out with a new propane tank to make the closest heater to us stronger. Great timing! 

Overall, the food was about 3.5/5. It was quite expensive but the portion sizes were plentiful. Unfortunately our food got cold within 5 minutes of finally getting it out. Atmosphere on the sidewalk was a 2/5."

The service was excellent, although a little slow but it was very busy. Our food was fresh and delicious, and I was very pleased by the meal. I believe the servers were doing the best they could while everywhere was packed to capacity. 

Shrimp scampi was great, and lamb chops & mac were very good. I'll try Piattini again in the future."

8,8,Piattini,3 star rating,6/19/2021,"We ordered a salad and a flight of wine. The salad promised a bit more than it delivered, being called ""cauliwow"". In the end it was more of a salad bar salad with corn and marinated cauliflower thrown in. 

The flight of wine was fun and unusual. 

Outdoor dining on newbury st makes up for most culinary sins, explaining the 4 star review."
9,9,Piattini,1 star rating,10/23/2021,"Update: hi Josephine, thank you for your prompt response. Here are my thoughts:

1. I wasn't aware of the garlic bread as it was not on the menu. But I am pretty sure that we have to order that separately and it doesn't come to the table for free :) 

2. I chose spinach gnocchi because of the good reviews i've seen as well! However it definitely did not meet my expectations. You commented that I should give the restaurant an opportunity to correct it. I did. I asked our waitress to ""reheat"" it because it was cold and hard. They responded super nicely and offered to recook it for me, yet when I got it back it was still cold and stale and I didn't bother to say it a third time especially considering the amount of time we had to wait for our waitress to come over (which I understand, it was busy, but it seemed like other tables around us were being served at a reasonable pace)

3. I was not aware that it was an OPTIONAL FEE as it was directly added onto our bill without my consent. I am not against having kitchen appreciation fee at all, all workers should be respected and appreciated for the hard work they put in. However, like you said, i believe it should be optional depending on the customers' personal experience. But that was not the case for us.

Again, this is my personal experience, which may not reflect other customers experiences here. People have different taste and different expectations for the restaurant. However I believe my personal option based on my personal experience should not be invalidated as ""simply complaining for the sake of complaining"". 

Thank you."
10,10,Piattini,4 star rating,11/20/2021,"Piattini is creative Italian dining on Boston's lovely Newbury Street. It's a bright & lively atmosphere, albeit a little loud for conversation.

Our dinner was delicious. I enjoyed the Salmon, which had the most amazing sauce. The cauliwow salad was also exceptional. Everyone in my party absolutely loved their meals. 2 of us had ravioli, 1 tried the meatballs & 1 had spaghetti Bolognese. 

The service, while friendly, left a little to be desired. We did feel a little ignored. That being said, it was a really busy Saturday evening. I would still go back, everyone has an off night every so often & the food was well worth it."
11,11,Piattini,4 star rating,2/8/2022,"Go here for the burrata!! The best appetizer I have ever had: heirloom tomatoes, prosciutto, burrata and fresh bread."
12,12,Piattini,2 star rating,7/1/2021,"This place may get lots of accolades but don't be fooled. My friend & I went to celebrate our birthdays & what a disappointment. The menu has small lettering so hard to read in such darkness. The service here is slow as anything, super inattentive which is not ok. We had to have to ask for water & bread multiple times which is pretty basic to make sure customers have. He checked on us only once towards the end, we had to flag him down the other times & he passed by our table all the time to get to his other tables & the kitchen. There is no reason for two people to have to sit around for that long & not be taken care of, it was like we were invisible. 

The staff come in from waiting on tables outside & then throw the dirty dishes very loudly into a tub that was only a few ft from us & it was super loud, unprofessional, & annoying. We basically had a 2+ hr meal which was salad & dessert. This whole place is loud, like more than it should be & it was such bad acoustics my friend had to adjust her hearing aid to try to hear me w/out the background noise. So no I won't go back & don't think you should bother."
13,13,Piattini,3 star rating,3/15/2022,"Came here on a whim with my friend. We ordered a pizza and bolognese. The pizza was enjoyable, and both the toppings and crust were good. On the other hand, the pasta in the bolognese was so overcooked and tasted like my old school lunches... The sauce itself was also just okay. Service wise, we were seated promptly, but the waiter didn't check in at all during the meal. This normally wouldn't have bothered me, but he never came to refill our waters during our meal either and barely looked in our direction so I couldn't even ask for a refill..."
14,14,Piattini,3 star rating,8/10/2021,"I love right off Newbury so tried this place out for lunch on a Saturday. We went pretty early, around 11am before crowds hit. I ordered the Shrimp Salad and my friend ordered the vegan ravioli. Newbury street is a very expensive street so prices were understandably high here as well. However I was extremely underwhelmed: 

Service: the waiters and hostess basically stand around a gossip and act as if it's an inconvenience to serve you. We had to physically flag the waiter any time we needed something 

Food: I cook quite a bit and the shrimp was extremely odd. For an $18 salad, I expected more than 3 shrimp and honestly I didn't even eat two of them because of an over cooked and stale taste. Super disappointing. The greens were fresh however. My friend did enjoy her ravioli. 

Ambience: it's Newbury street and very cute for people watching so no complaints there. 

Overall just super average and NOTTT worth the price"
15,15,Piattini,4 star rating,8/10/2021,"My boyfriend and I checked out this place during a trip to Newbury St. because it has the cutest patio area! Really great ambiance for a casual date, friend get together, or even for a lunch break from shopping. 

For cocktails, I ordered the Il Spritzer and my boyfriend ordered the vodka lemonade. The vodka lemonade was so good that I ordered it for my second round. We ordered the meatballs as an appetizer and got the shrimp scampi and burrata pizza as entrees. I would highly recommend the burrata pizza and definitely add prosciutto! The waiter said the shrimp scampi is their most popular dish but for me, it was just so-so. Probably going to order something else next time. 

Overall, it was a great spot and I'd recommend it to anyone in the area!"
16,16,Piattini,4 star rating,4/8/2021,"This place is definitely on the pricier end but overall pretty satisfied with my meal! The burrata ravioli is a must! The burrata is so creamy and sandwiches the fried eggplant perfectly, and is surrounded by such a rich tasty sauce which was honestly perfect for dipping the complementary bread in. The spinach gnocchi however was a bit heavier and a bit underwhelming; the flavors weren't too special or distinct and the gnocchi was a bit less soft and chewy as I would have preferred. The warm chocolate torta dessert definitely hit the spot though: the chocolate cake was so warm and had a softer center, and was paired so perfectly with the ice cream!!"
17,17,Piattini,5 star rating,12/17/2021,"Piattini has a really great vibe, great food, and great wine! What really brought me to this place though was the ""impossible"" ravioli - I'd never seen it on any menu before and loved that they had a really interesting vegan option (btw, it was great). I also recommend the wine flight!"
18,18,Piattini,2 star rating,2/25/2021,"The service was great but unfortunately, the gluten-free options were disappointing.

After walking around Newbury street, my boyfriend and I decided to try out Piattini after seeing they had gluten-free options for both pizza and pasta. If you're gluten-free, you know how hard it can be to find good GF Italian options! Sadly, the pizza and pasta we ordered were not great. 

The gluten-free Margarita pizza was clearly a frozen cauliflower crust, but the problem wasn't the crust, it was that the toppings kept sliding off the pizza. Every time I picked up a slice, the sauce and cheese would simply slide off the crust making it really hard to not only pick up but also enjoy the pizza. 

The gluten-free pasta Bolognese was also disappointing as the gluten-free pasta was overcooked and very chewy. The sauce was also underseasoned. 

Maybe their regular pizza and pasta is better, but when it comes to gluten-free options maybe opt for a different place."
19,19,Piattini,2 star rating,2/6/2022,"Just ok... I went there for my birthday and was underwhelmed. The service was not worth the ~30 per plate. The red wine was served hot so I had to add a bit of ice so it was drinkable, the waiter did not show us the ticket before checking out, and it felt we had to pay when the waiter came around (as if we were being forced to pay and leave and we had been ther about one hour only). Also, it is shown online as a good wine restaurant but it isn't. The wine selection is not that great and the way they serve wines is as if they don't care that much about the wine aspect of the restaurant. The only plus is that the food prep was fast. There are other Italian places in the northend with much better service and with similar or cheaper prices per plate."

Piattini, with a nice outdoor scene (pre-covid as well!), delicious bread/cheese boards, wine selection and sangria, as well as delicious entrees... this is a fantastic place to catch up, watch the hustle and bustle of Newbury street, and feel wined and dined.

22,22,Piattini,1 star rating,10/23/2021,"Update:
I want to emphasize that during my visit at Piattini, we asked for the waiter for various things like utensils, water, ordering food, and our food MULTIPLE times. And every time, we were either ignored or brushed off as nothing happened afterwards. It was only after I had to physically get up out of my seat and directly request to be served from a waiter who was not in charge of our table.

Also, I doubt that one tiny lemon wedge could turn a shrimp scampi into a full on lemon pasta with bland 1-dimensional flavor. But, maybe your restaurant cannot take any criticism as Piattini only believes any comments/reviews to be unwarranted complaints. 

Additionally, I would like to ask why you assumed that the reviews before me were friends that I dined with. I don't ever recall stating who I dined with, unpess you made some assumptions or stereotypes.

If I had the option, I would give this restaurant a 0 star, but unfortunately, you get a saving grace with an automatic 1 star. Next time, please take your customer's critiques and recommendations seriously before advising us to not complain for the sake of complaining.

If you are thinking of coming to Piattini, I HIGHLY recommend saving your money and sparing your brain cells by going to a different restaurant."

I also recommend their mushroom, pepper and artichoke pizza - fantastic! Will certainly be coming back."
26,26,Piattini,5 star rating,1/8/2022,"We ordered 3 piattini between 2 people and it was the perfect amount of food. We got the burrata, muscles and spinach gnocchi. Not gonna lie, the bottom of my plate had so many different sauces and juices that using the bread as a mop was the best move all the night. The muscle juice with a little bit of cheese and pesto created a sweet medley in my mouth. On the other hand they put us in the corner and we had a reservation but hey you don't get to pick your seat. Pre dinner bread was solid and the food came out quickly which is always a bonus."

29,29,Piattini,2 star rating,11/18/2020,"Meh. Piattini came highly recommended by several guidebooks as well as Yelp, but I was highly underwhelmed when my friend and I had a quick lunch here after wandering the area. The Newbury Street tax is really something. 

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. We were seated promptly on the patio - sunny, warm fall day - and distancing safety precautions were all taken. Our server was friendly, and the food came out promptly. However, I found the food to be just okay and the price wasn't worth it. 

I had the shrimps scampi, which was fine - rather light on the shrimp and the flavor, especially for the $16 price tag (y'all know pasta costs like $.30 per serving, right?) but it did the job. I also ordered a glass of prosecco, which was pretty middle-bottom-shelf stuff. It was also fine. The whole experience, with tax and tip, ran me $35 for a plate of okay pasta and a glass of cheap bubbly. 

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, or should have come for dinner, or should have expected it from a Newbury Street spot.  Still, as someone who values, um, value when dining out, Piattini just wasn't worth it. Grab a sandwich somewhere and save your pennies for a real Italian meal in the North End instead."
30,30,Piattini,4 star rating,10/28/2020,"Really yummy dishes! All were very tasty but pretty overpriced in my opinion for ~ $25 vegetarian entrees. I'd understand the higher price if they have meet. The gnocchi is an appetizer actually and cheaper but for a similar price, so would recommend."
31,31,Piattini,1 star rating,3/28/2021,"I'll start by saying that I love the food here (as you can see from my previous review). However, my most recent experience has ensured that I will likely not be coming back.

The restaurant staff today was absurdly inattentive and scattered. Other reviewers have mentioned their great service and I previously have also had positive experiences when I dined here where I felt respected and well attended to. I don't know if my poor service today was because my party was a younger group (and perhaps this somehow meant we were less deserving of their time and attention?) or because it was a busy day for them and the staff was stretched thin; possibly a combination of the two. One of the plates we were given with our complimentary bread was dirty so we asked for a new one, which was never brought to us. While waiting for our food, another waiter came by (unprompted) and asked if we were ready for the check, and I heard a waiter tell another table that he would check on their food for them, only for them to reply that they hadn't gotten the chance to order yet. We received our food in a very reasonable amount of time, which I appreciated, but once we received it, our server was missing for the next 30 minutes. None of the staff dropped by our table to refill our waters (glasses were empty within the first 5 minutes), ask how our food was, or check if we needed anything within the entire period we were eating. The first time someone finally did swing by our table, we were ready for the check. 

While we were eating, my table was also harassed by a passerby from the sidewalk (we were dining on the outdoor patio), who came up to our table (within 4 feet) and loudly/repeatedly yelled at us to share our food with him. This went on for at least a good 20-30 seconds, and needless to say it was an uncomfortable experience. As a party with two women, and given the recent surge in occurrences of anti-Asian violence across the country (I am an Asian female), I felt very unsafe. Given that we were seated no more than 10 feet from both the hostess station and the entrance to the restaurant, I find it surprising that no one from the staff noticed or stepped in to protect their customers from being harassed. Though the incident itself was by no means Piattini's fault, I felt their failure to intervene, either because they didn't care to or because they were so inattentive to their customers that they didn't notice (neither of which reflects well), was disappointing. 

Though I think the food here is wonderful, I can't justify coming when the service is so lacking and there are so many other restaurants around Newbury St and Boston that are of similar price and quality."
32,32,Piattini,4 star rating,5/16/2021,"Lots of outdoor seating, and turnaround between ordering and food arriving was super fast! Fusilli pesto was super fresh and scampi had the tenderest shrimp.

Highlight might have been dessert though. Beautiful presentation and even better tastes. Tried both the Flourless Chocolate Cake and the Hazelnut Gelato Torta...could not say or spell it for the life of me BUT unbelievable. Together the two were extremely filling but worth it.

When we sat down, we were greeted by the kindest, most accommodating waiter who set the mood by joking around with us and helping us pick out our meal for the night. The food was absolutely amazing, from the complementary bread... fluffy and light, the cheese plate, the burrata ravioli and shrimp scampi... alive with richness and flavor, and the chocolate cake dessert.

We did have reservations and they initially seated us in the dining area near the kitchen. We requested a different table, and they were very nice and accommodated our request. Our server was great!! Our waters were constantly filled, he responded quickly when we had questions, and he was professional yet personable! AND the food was amazing!! We started by sharing the arugula salad. So glad we shared it because it was generous enough for two! Loved the combo of caramelized beets, butternut squash, and cheese. SO good!! We then enjoyed the veal secondi (my hubby) and the mussels (me!). The veal was very tender and delicious!! Yes, he spared a bite for me :o). My mussels were fresh with tomatoes, wine, garlic, and herbs, served with ciabatta.  They were wonderful!! I needed carbs for the marathon, so I had also ordered a half order of the homemade fusilli with pesto and wild mushrooms. YUUUMMMM!!!! I've never had such delicious homemade pasta! It was so tender! Had to skip dessert because we were so full, but if I run Boston again we will definitely come here for another delicious meal!"
44,44,Piattini,4 star rating,9/4/2021,"Came here on a rainy night while helping sister move in to a new apartment. Surprised there wasn't any bread to gnaw on while we went over the menu. Started with the Cremini pizza as an appetizer, which was great. I could've eaten the whole thing, but I rarely feel the need to eat pizza at Italian places like this. I went with the FRUTTI DI MARE with the red sauce, and loved it. I don't often go for seafood, but it was the most appealing option at the moment. Winded down the meal with the tiramisu, which was amazing. Washed it all down with LONG TRAIL GREENBLAZE IPA. Everyone else loved their meals too. A great time overall."
45,45,Piattini,4 star rating,6/15/2021,"Pretty delicious food! Fairly expensive. I was happy to see that they had some delicious vegan options! Unfortunately the portion size wasn't too big, and the price was on the more expensive side of Italian food. The vegan options truly were so tasty however, and I'd go back again in a heartbeat if it weren't for the price! Not sure if they were just busy, but the wait staff took a very long time between things, which in all was not a terrible issue. Atmosphere was still very cute for a date night :)"

47,47,Piattini,1 star rating,6/24/2021,"We sat down at an outdoor table for two and I promptly shat on by a bird within seconds.  I should have taken this as a premonition.  We waited a few minutes for a waiter to come by and explained what had happened and if we could have a napkin (probably should have been on the table to begin with). With shit on my neck I watched as he proceeded to go take orders from a few other tables before making his way back inside.  Another 5 minutes and he was out with our napkins and said he would be back to take our order shortly.  

We proceeded to wait an additional 25 minutes before seeing his face again as he resurfaced to attend to the tables around us.  Trying to get his attention each time it was another 10 minutes before we could flag him down.  So we are now at 40 minutes sitting down before we are able to get a drink order in.  Understanding the situation that has been bestowed upon us we decide to order our drinks and food together (not knowing when the next time we might see him is).  I order a beer and my girlfriend orders a bottle of Prosecco in addition to two salads .

After another 10 minutes of waiting I am able to flag him down and order another beer.  If the first one takes more than 10 minutes I should surely put my name in the queue for the next one.  

The drinks come shortly after that.  We are brought 1 bottle of Prosecco, 2 bottles of beer and 1 beer glass.  No issue right?  Except immediately after dropping of the drinks he disappears again.  After waiting almost an hour for our drinks we are left with a bottle of Prosecco that was not opened for us nor were we provided glasses to drink it out of.  I laughed and considered myself the lucky one for a brief moment for ordering a beer. A very brief moment.  These beers were not in fact twist offs.  Our waiter had left us here with an unopened bottle of Prosecco with no glasses and two unopened beers.  I have never been stranded deserted island but I am starting to appreciate the feeling.  Fortunately I keep a bottle opener on my keychain so I am prepared for situations like these.

We do not see our waiter for a while but eventually he does come back with two wine glasses for our Prosecco.  We would be responsible for opening the bottle of Prosecco though.

Shortly after downing my first beer our food comes out.  Not just the salads but the entrees too.  Can you believe how lucky we are to get two plates of food all at once while our tiny table now has 2 bottles of beer, a bottle of Prosecco, and a 2nd bread basket (which we had to pay extra for for fear of starvation at that point).  Talk about ambiance.  

We eat for the next 20 minutes without anyone checking in to ask how it is or if we would like anything else.  As we are winding down I flag down the waiter for our check.  When he comes back I just hand over my card to expedite the process.  No need to look it over and risk him leaving for an indefinite period of time.  When he returns my excited cannot be understated.  I am free. All I have to do is sign my name, pack up my things, and head home after a dissapointing evening.  That feeling although powerful is too good to be true.  There is no pen.  Of course there is no pen.  Why would there be a pen?  Have I learned nothing about this establishment over the past hour and a half.  

After another indefinite period of time I am able to flag him down and I am able to obtain a pen. Thank the Lord.  

I have never left less than 20% tip at any restaurant for any reason.  That is for the minimum service and it is usually higher.  Tonight I left Zero dollars and I do not regret it for one second.  That was not just the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant but one of the worst experiences I have had period.  There are hundreds of restaurants in walking distance of this place and while I have not been to every one I would be confident in recommending any of them over this place.

Peace"

49,49,Piattini,5 star rating,1/26/2022,"Lovely restaurant, very good food, excellent service.  Highly recommend.  Wish I took photos to post.  Will next time. Outdoor dining nice when weather is good but can be a bit crowded."
50,50,Piattini,3 star rating,10/26/2021,The food was okay when my friends and I decided to have some vegetarian friendly pasta. The service was very slow. I think it took about 30-40 mins to get our food on what seemed to be like a non busy evening
51,51,Piattini,4 star rating,8/29/2021,Had a good meal here last night.  Service was good too. My only complaint is that we sat in the large back room.  The noise and music were extremely loud because there is no sound absorbing material on the walls or ceiling.  This needs to be added ASAP to make dinning more comfortable. It was very hard to talk.
52,52,Piattini,4 star rating,10/17/2021,"Food was pretty good. I kind of feel like it's just another Downtown Boston-located Italian food place - decent, but not amazing. I wish they had more menu options, as well. I did enjoy their cheeseboard! Also got the tuna tartar appetizer and spinach gnocchi, both of which were decent."
53,53,Piattini,4 star rating,5/22/2019,"This is a great Italian place right in downtown Boston, specifically Back Bay area. I personally really enjoyed my experience there. The space has a nice ambiance. They can offer more intimate, personal dining experience for dates or for large parties alike. The waitresses were polite and efficient. They greeted you, asked nicely if we had any reservation, brought out the food promptly for everyone in your dining party..and take care of my requests you have.

The food is also just as good. Even for lunch, we found the portion size to be good..and with great prices, too (pasta dishes for lunch go for $11-15..not bad at all!). Everyone in our dining party enjoyed the meal. I had their lobster ravioli ($13) and thought the portion was just right. It was on a light lunch side...but definitely kept me satisfied through remaining of the day. Their other pasta dishes like angel hair or spaghetti seemed to be more filling though..so if you are hungry..you may want to go for that..or pick a pasta dish and another appetizer or two...and you will be satisfied.

I definitely want to stop by Piattini again in the future. But I will also want to make sure I RSVP ahead of going there for sure. Their space isn't too big..so if you want a nice Italian place in Back Bay...save on a potential headache and make a reservation ahead of time!"
54,54,Piattini,5 star rating,4/25/2021,"The restaurant had a great vibe to it. A wonderful menu, not overly long but made up of many interesting options. I love cauliflower crust on the pizza option.  The mussels were out of this world. 

Lots of outdoor dining.  Nice back room which can be rented out."
55,55,Piattini,1 star rating,4/25/2021,"I don't like to write bad reviews, but this one I had to give it a 1 star for the poor customer service. Yesterday, my friend and wanted pizza so we happened to pass by this restaurant that offered it. We didn't book a reservation beforehand, as it looked very packed for outdoor dining. I immediately asked the hostess what would be the wait time for a table of 2. She said she could actually seat us right away. 

When we got to our table, we noticed we were seated to a tiny table that was right next to the crowded pathway of the street. Many onlookers were very close to us, so we wondered if it was possible to switch to another table (covid precaution: wanted to be safe). We had kindly asked our waiter if it was possible to sit at the table across that was a bit bigger for us both and won't be near the crowd, he told us ""yes, of course."" However, right after we moved, the hostess came back up to our table with a upset look and told us we cannot move to the other table: assuming we moved without mentioning to anyone. Right in front of everyone, the hostess mentioned how we were pissing other customers off who are on the reservation list and we couldn't just move because this was a table of 4 and were are 2. We were so confused by this altercation because we had asked the waiter beforehand and he mentioned yes, so the hostess put the blame onto us, thought we started it, and thought we made a scene when we never did. We apologized anyways and moved back but still were confused as to her being upset and annoyed at us. We looked around and saw 2 people sitting at bigger tables but we didn't want to question any further. I noticed our waiter felt really bad for us after and kept apologizing.

The food was another issue that upset us a lot. I've never waited for my food for almost 2 HOURS. I don't know how I even had the patience to wait for 2 hours. Our bread already came an hr late. My friend and I were confused as to why the people around us who came AFTER us had their food first, some even finished before our food even came. My mimosa I ordered, I finished way before our food came (possibly a half hr before). Our waiter felt very bad again that he kept going back and forth and questioning his team where our food was. We didn't question it because we didn't want to make it seem or have the hostess think that ""we're creating a fuss again"" so we just waited. But at that point, we were just very upset by everything. 

Go here if you want, but just heads up the service not that great. Foods just alright. Not sure if it was just a busy, nice hot weekend. But I've NEVER had customer experience in Newbury St like that before..."
56,56,Piattini,5 star rating,11/18/2019,"Had the best solo lunch here! 

Was traveling in Boston on business and just needed to have some alone time. It was around 2 or 3pm when I decided to stop at Piattini due to a recommendation to try the gnocchi from a vegetarian friend. I took a seat outside and was serviced very amicably and efficiently.

I ordered a cafe latte and the spinach gnocchi as per my friends recommendation. The temperature at the time was very comfortable and the comforting food added to the overall feeling of relaxation and contentment. A little bird even came to sit on my table and tried to steal an entire slice of complimentary bread! Though the bread was much too heavy for it.

That gnocchi was great. And so was the service. Will definitely be back in the warmer months to enjoy people and bird watching in their outdoor seating section."
57,57,Piattini,2 star rating,8/27/2021,"I'm new to the city...but if you're a city with a reputation for Italian food your Italian food better be good. It was not good. Service pretty much ignored us flat out and they never checked on us. Cocktail wasn't bad though, and the pizza was edible. It just tasted more ""Dominos"" than ""$17"". I will be ordering Dominos over this"
58,58,Piattini,5 star rating,4/7/2019,"This is my first time in Boston. I had asked the concierge where he recommended that was close by and he gave me a list of three restaurants but said that Piattini was his ultimate favorite! And I love Italian, so decided to give it a try! 

When I arrived there, it was quite crowded, so I knew it must be good. Luckily, for a Saturday night, the wait for a table of 2 was only 15 minutes! (I was expecting to have to wait longer!) 

Looking over the menu, I spotted a wine flight section and decided to try that out! I got the fruttoso rosso flight and they were all delicious!! 

For my main, I ordered the kale pesto pasta. It came with roasted red peppers and grape tomatoes. I was a bit unsure of how I would like kale pesto, but I'm so glad I tried it because I LOVED it!! Would 100% order again! 

I had looked over the dessert menu and everything sounded so good, but I was too full and had to pass. 

Our waiter was amazing as well. He provided his recommendations and was very attentive to anything that we might have needed!

If you're new to Boston, or a lifer, I highly recommend trying this place out!"
59,59,Piattini,1 star rating,10/10/2021,I was absolutely speechless. I'm usually someone who is not picky about their food at all. This was the most bland and cold pasta I have ever eaten. I saw the reviews and decided to go but I was extremely disappointed. The service was terrible as the waiter only visited our table twice. Since there were so many fees involved I thought I would get better service but that wasn't the case. I never even got my water refilled. The plates were dirty and we had to ask for replacements. Three medium sized meatballs were $14 and it tasted like very bad college dining hall food. I do not recommend this place at all. Please reconsider the price is NOT worth it unfortunately.
60,60,Piattini,1 star rating,10/10/2021,"Bad food and a lot of hidden fees. If you come here, expect to pay overpriced bad food and expect to have to ask a waiter three times before you can get anything solved. Kitchen appreciation fee also included for unseasoned, bland food. Save ur wallet and tongue."
61,61,Piattini,4 star rating,7/9/2021,"This place is great I sat inside and the best thing about this place was the service I got from our waitress. She refilled our waters everytime it was empty. The quality of the food was alright, but I thought the dishes were a little bit expensive. Inside was small I wish I sat outside instead because it felt tight for a party of 5 in doors"
62,62,Piattini,1 star rating,5/21/2021,"Having arrived 3 minutes after confirming a table outside, we were ushered inside, (Strike 1) where the music was so unbearable the other patrons had to shout at one another to be heard.  Our waiter, was very helpful, and kindly offered to lower the music but it didn't make that much of a difference. 

Sadly, the food didn't compensate for the ambiance. I knew we were in trouble when the burrata appetizer was absolutely tasteless. How do you ruin burrata??? By the time the mains came we were hoping for a better result. Regrettably it seems the chef has lost his tastebuds, or the kitchen has run out of seasoning. Maybe a little SALT would be a nice addition to the repertoire. As I looked at all of our meals, they were prepared in the same haphazard manner. All the plates were drenched in sauce, probably to disguise the lack of flavor.  

I have to warn you, this is probably the worst restaurant I have been to in Boston.  I will never set foot in there again.Go to Serafina, across the street. If you can't get in there's a Shake Shack two doors down, You'll have a better experience."
63,63,Piattini,4 star rating,8/28/2021,"Piattini is a nice little place on Newbury street. Compared to the location, the prices are quite cheap and the portions are big they have pastas and pizzas for mains primarily, we've only had pasta when visiting. Service is attentive and fast. Bolognese is my favourite. A bit underrated, don't let the cheap prices scare you away. You get value for money!! We're coming back regularly"
64,64,Piattini,5 star rating,1/2/2021,"Three days later, I am still dreaming of Piattini and their black truffle ravioli! Possibly the best pasta I have had in years. My husband and I found this spot on Yelp and it is a must go to in Boston. Our server was great and disclosed to us that it was his first day - luckily we could not tell! Great spot."
65,65,Piattini,5 star rating,7/31/2020,"I absolutely love Piattini. One of my go to places in Back Bay for Italian food. Great outdoor seating on Newbury street. Literally everything here is sooooo delicious.  I highly recommend any dish that has pesto in it, you cannot go wrong! 

Our favorite waiter is Maximo!! He is kind, helpful, hilarious and extremely personable. If you get him as your server, it will be a treat! This was our second time having him as a server and he gave us a tiramisu on the house.  10/10!

Food: Food was fine but WAYYYYY too overpriced. All of the dishes we ordered were vegan/vegetarian and the plate average was about $20 which is ridiculous when there's no meat. We got the vegan bolognese, the vegan ravioli, and the pesto pasta with mushrooms. I've had better pesto pasta at Panera. Save your money or go to the North End.

Ambiance: The lighting was quite dim (contrary to the photos taken). Weird hospital-esque white lighting that created a strange, vaguely unenjoyable ambiance. Also, not sure if this was a stylistic choice but there's a huge photo of a face printed on the wall next to us. I guess it added to ""the vibe"" but it was still really weird to eat food while a giant face was staring at us."
67,67,Piattini,1 star rating,7/5/2021,Service is non existing. Food is awful. Noise level inside is off the charts. Don't waste your time.
68,68,Piattini,5 star rating,3/11/2021,"The best customer service in Boston. The staff is wonderful. Further, the food is delicious and moderately priced. I love love love this restaurant."
69,69,Piattini,5 star rating,11/28/2021,"Went here for dinner with some girlfriends, the place is very cozy and nice. The food was amazing and so were the drinks. Incredible staff, I would definitely come back here."
70,70,Piattini,4 star rating,11/2/2018,"PROS:
- Wonderful staff. The hostess and our waitress were friendly.
- Good cocktail menu
- Looking at the food menu, I could tell this place knows its ingredients. Everything looked really tempting. It was hard to choose just one haha
- Large portions for the pasta so I feel like the slightly higher pricing that puts some people off is very understandable. Also, please consider the fact that you're eating at Newbery St. so of course the restaurants around here will be a bit pricier.

CONS:
- Make reservations! It's a popular restaurant at a popular location so it's quite busy. Never hurts to plan ahead :)
- Small space. We sat at the table for 2 right in front of the door on the side of the kitchen. It was a pretty small space with lots of people walking by since it's a busy restaurant. Not too stuffed that we felt uncomfortable though.

SPECIFICS:
- Penne Con Zucca = Pasta was cooked perfectly. The gorgonzola cheese was beautifully melted and pulled into strings with each forkful. The squash was cooked into a nice tenderness while keeping its texture. Chicken was nice and tender too, not too dry. Only needed a tad of salt to balance out the sweetness of the squash but it's a simple fix. 

OVERVIEW: 
Would come back again to give some of their enticing menu items a try. Make reservations ahead of time."
71,71,Piattini,3 star rating,6/11/2021,"Ok but not on par with the neighborhood for the price. 

Check your receipt too. What we were charged did not match the website or printed menu."
72,72,Piattini,5 star rating,5/14/2021,Huge portions! The mushroom truffle ravioli was really rich and flavorful. The ravioli was quite stuffed which was delicious. Definitely would come back and they had very nice outdoor seating.
73,73,Piattini,5 star rating,5/11/2021,Delicious bolognese! The gnocchi was very tasty as well. Lamp chops were seasoned well. Great place for a quick snack on Newbury street. Service was attentive and friendly.

75,75,Piattini,4 star rating,11/4/2021,"My wife and I had a great experience at Piattini last night.  We are visiting Boston and found this restaurant while exploring the area near our hotel.  It was not busy and we felt like we had the place to ourselves.  Our server, Naina, was great.  She answered all our questions and was friendly and responsive.  Our food was delicious and arrived quickly.  One of our dishes arrived a little salty; we told Naina when she asked us how everything was. The kitchen quickly prepared the dish again and it was perfect.  Overall, we had a great time and very glad we stopped here."
76,76,Piattini,3 star rating,2/17/2019,"PROS
- Location, location, location! Right off Newbury Street for hungry shoppers.
- Vegan options! Got the vegan ravioli and they didn't skimp on the veggies.
- Free flow bread but no balsamic vinegar :(
- Cozy atmosphere and patient wait staff
- Lots of local seafood options (lobster ravioli, frutti di mare, etc.)
- lobster ravioli was mixed into a mind-blowing sauce 

CONS
- pricy for its taste, definitely had better Italian food for the same price"
77,77,Piattini,3 star rating,5/13/2021,Honestly not surprised at the quality. I figured since it's on Newbury the prices wouldn't match the quality. $28 for a seafood pasta dish and it looked something you could throw together yourself for less than $10. Presentation was sloppy as well. Just go to the North End for Italian food! Average tasting food that's pretty expensive. Three stars for the Sangria tho!
78,78,Piattini,5 star rating,10/25/2021,"It was a nice sunny day on Newbury St, so my partner and I decided to try the outdoor seating. I am pleased that we stumbled upon this little gem. Everything was great - food was delicious and the service was quick."
79,79,Piattini,4 star rating,7/9/2018,"Great Italian food in a very central, convenient location. My dad, sister, and I made a reservation for a Saturday night about an hour prior and had absolutely no issues. The restaurant didn't seem too crowded at around 6 PM though we were still seated in a cramped back area. It was a beautiful day and an outdoor table would have been nice, but alas. 

To start, we ordered the mussels appetizer (cozze con vino) and found it delicious. This was the highlight of the meal -- so fresh and light, with this perfect toasty bread to match. The mussels were sautéed with garlic and tomatoes and the whole dish was so flavorful; it brought back memories of coastal Italian weekends from study abroad. 

We then ordered 3 pasta dishes as entrees -- me the boscaiola with fettuccine (prosciutto, green peas, wild mushrooms, tomato cream), my dad the scampi (linguini, tiger shrimp, fresh tomato, lemon white wine), and my sister the fusilli pesto (fusilli, pesto, and wild mushrooms). The buscaiola was FANTASTIC -- the 3 of us were all eating off my plate. The tomato cream sauce was just delectable and the chewiness of the prosciutto paired well with the fettuccine. My dad actually didn't love the scampi though I liked it (tasted super fresh but could have used a little more flavor, in my opinion). My sister's pesto was also good, though not a standout like the others were. 

They also have a decent wine selection and the service was attentive and friendly. Definitely recommend after a long day of shopping!"
80,80,Piattini,4 star rating,6/6/2018,"Piattini is a full service decent Italian eats in Back bay!  

++    Ambiance is intimate. Set below the street, inside is split into 2 DRs, one with a full bar and an outdoor patio.  

+      Food was good but far from authentic Italian.  Everyone liked their dishes especially lobster ravioli, meatballs and scampi.  But my chicken squash penne was a little sweet and not al dente as ordered.  What I really liked was their fig jam from the cheese board, fresh baked bread and fresh arugula (salad was lacking but the greens were fresh).   They have a full bar and a good sized wine list too.  

++    Price is rather reasonable for the overall food, the service and their location.

++    Service was very good!  Attentive and steady throughout the meal.  

We walked to the restaurant from our hotel.   Parking on or near Newberry is tight street or private lots.   

I would revisit Piattini again but order another dish!

81,81,Piattini,1 star rating,4/24/2021,"Terrible experience!!! My girl and I dined in this evening. To start off, the service was unacceptable. No one initially greeted us. I had to ask for service. Which I understand today was a busy day.... Once I requested service, the waiter who took on the order never showed back up. Which then lead another waiter to finish his work. Also, the icing on the cake was while leaving. No one greeted us by saying. ""Have a goodnight, thank you for coming"". Etc! Food was good service was trash!! Maybe if you want a good experience at Piattini, please eat outside. I believe that's where the focus is at!!"

85,85,Piattini,3 star rating,11/9/2019,"Cozy restaurant, but the food and service was generally mediocre. 

The bread given when we first sat down was very cold and tasted alright. The spinach gnocchi was actually very good and I highly recommend it, but the remaining pastas we ordered were also just ok. The chicken in one pasta was dry and seemed like it had been overboiled. The flavor of the sauces was nothing special. All of these made the meal feel overpriced for the quality.

Additionally, our server did not seem to care about our table very much. After offering more bread and telling us he would be right back with it, we never ended up getting a second round of bread. Also, he only appeared at our table to take our order and give us a check. Did not offer us parmesan after we got our pastas, even though every other table around us did receive this service. Thus, it was a pretty mediocre experience and certainly not worth the price."

Fair service, nice food

The owner and server were neither impassioned nor  impassive. It took me a second to find the entrance of this place. 

I came here since I was recommended to try their spinach Gnocchi. The spinach Gnocchi did fit my taste. Apart from tomato slices, everything in the dish seems to be green. Green cream and green Gnocchi with a little bit of tomato slices dripped in. I personally love the taste of Gnocchi because of its rich flour taste and spinach smell. The food itself worths a 4* rate. 

Considering the overall atmosphere and comparing to restaurants in this area, 3.5* would be the final rate."
88,88,Piattini,4 star rating,1/11/2018,"Sometimes, you just don't feel like venturing to the North End for Italian food. Sometimes, you just want to be in the back bay, especially after a long day of shopping. Piattini has excellent Italian food, with slightly higher prices than the North End.
We started off with the homemade meatballs, made of beef and pork. They were a good size, and really soft and tender.
I can't resist home made pasta- it is so much better than pasta in a box. The bolognese is made with homemade fusilli- ooh the fusilli was so good. You could tell it was homemade, the shape was different from fusilli in a box. It was topped with ground meat, simply amazing.
I would highly recommend Piattini if you are looking for great Italian food in the Back Bay!"
89,89,Piattini,5 star rating,9/7/2019,"I rarely get chicken mainly because it's a little boring, but whatever they do to the chicken here has be reconsidering my stance on that, the server talked me into it and glad she did. The chicken I refer to is the Pollo Al Carciofi which I had never heard of before but it really exceeded expectations. 
Also had the burrata app and tomatoes were surprisingly fresh and juicy which was also unexpected.
Decent beer and wine selection although would have loved to see some taps instead of just bottled and cans and clap your hands."
90,0,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,4/5/2022,"Hands down my favorite bowl of Pho in Boston.

Small Menu with just the essentials. Each item is done beautifully. Plated well, garnished well.

The broth is amazing here. It is so incredibly subtle and deep in flavor. Sure it might not be the most savory or MSG flavored but I really enjoy the complexities of taste in the broth. 

The aesthetic of this restaurant is also beautiful. I visited this restaurant once pre-COVID and was surprised to see the nearly complete transformation. They changed wall decor, tables and have even more plants (which was the main selling point before) 

I love this place and will be back pho more!

-Koh"
91,1,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/5/2022,"Love this place. Pho is pretty good (probably my second favorite after my favorite spot Sai Gon Dep in NYC), but the grilled rice plates are the best. Both grilled chicken and pork are herbaliviously delicious, and gluten free for this little celiac. 

The vibe of this place is wonderful. It's like a little nature romantic oasis in the middle of Boston, and just so darn cute. Plants and flowers everywhere and the gnomes!

They also have amazing spring rolls, but the peanut sauce is not Gf so make sure you replace with fish sauce. One thing to note is this place gets BUSY and often have 1-2 servers for a full place, even at odd times like 3 or 4 pm and dishes do take a bit of time to come out, So plan accordingly. We typically get take out which isn't an issue, and place our order, go do something else, and come back after."

Called them after their open time, which is 11 am according to yelp and google) to check if they are open. Yes, I have to call first to check if they are open because they are never on time. I ended up calling them 10 times in 40 minutes, no one picked up the phone. They always do this in terms of their opening hour. Last Sunday, I called and asked what time they're open, they said 12:30 pm while it says 12 on yelp and google. But last time I was lucky that somebody picked up the phone. I guess I'm not really lucky today then.
My friend one time called them to order Pho and the waitress at that time told her the chef was not there (wtf?) so she had to call back after 30 minutes, then she called back again and the chef was still not there. What a ridiculous restaurant! If they don't wanna work, why bother opening a restaurant and treat customers like we are beggars?"
93,3,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,11/9/2021,"Ordered for take-out. The pork bahn mi sandwich was nicely wrapped and tasted pretty good. Pretty much exactly what I expect...and as always wished it had a little more protein, just like everywhere else I've been. Who couldn't use a little more, right?

We ordered pho from here specifically because the other pho/thai place next door didn't serve take-out in a bowl so we could eat back at the hotel. We were super disappointed that they placed raw meat in the bowl of ingredients. That just doesn't make any sense! That's Food Safety 101 - Cross contamination!!! Cook the meat first or put it in plastic container with the hot soup broth.  We had to try and cook it in the microwave in the hotel.

No one got sick, but that's not the way I like to experience excitement. Lol."
94,4,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,9/23/2021,"Honestly wasn't expecting much when I first came in. It's well-decorated but dimly lit. Didn't smell of the typical aromas of Vietnamese restaurants, and the classical music was at EDM volume. Thankfully, the server was so kind to turn it down a couple notches for me! And once the food arrived, all my initial meh feelings went right out the door. Beautifully plated (just look at it!!) and equally delicious. 

Signature Banh Mi - WOW. The pulled chicken has such a unique flavor. The ginger really comes through here and nothing is too overwhelming. Nice crispy bread. Would 100% buy several to eat throughout the week if I could. 

Pho - Ordered the kid size so I could save room for more food lol but even the kid size was a decent serving! Ideally would have liked more flavor in the broth, but meat is so fresh and moist (not dry like most pho spots). 

Rice with Grilled Pork - Another happy surprise! I want to pack whatever the sauce is in a bottle and pour it on everything. The only thing I would change is the portion size- much less than what I'm used to getting."
95,5,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,1/25/2022,Wonderful! I would definitely come back. We loved our summer roll and pho - perfect for a cold day. They have a unique dipping sauce for their summer rolls which we absolutely loved. The pho was fantastic with a great broth. Our server was extremely kind and we felt bad that he was so busy! He was attentive nonetheless and our experience was flawless. We also both also got smoothies since we were craving it and they were delicious and definitely made with fresh fruit. I got the avocado smoothie and my husband got the strawberry banana smoothie! Great spot for when you're craving Vietnamese food!
96,6,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,12/11/2021,"Following Boston Pops Christmas Performance at Symphony Hall we fell upon a small but incredible surprise...Saigon Fusion a cute restaurant, friendly staff and the quiet ambiance a gift aside the bustling avenue. We ordered very fresh and excellent Shrimp Spring Rolls. Their Signature and Grilled pork banh mi sandwiches, perfectly prepared with fresh savory herbs. Then we added traditional Pho Bo (noodle soup)
We have travelled from LA. San Diego, San Francisco, New York and now Boston. We have been to too many Vietnamese restaurants to remember but we will never forget the EXCELLENT, succulent,  perfectly balanced Pho Bo....whatever they did, not your pedestrian version!  Everything prepared incredibly delicious!
We will now place for 2021 and possibly 2022 this quaint and quiet amazing Vietnamese restaurant ***Saigon Fusion***"
97,7,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,10/13/2021,"Came here on a Saturday night, around 6:45 pm and had to wait around 10 minutes for a party of 3. Waiters took a long time to bring water and paper menus, and our food took about an hour to come. The three of us wanted the signature banh mi, but they were out of jambon so we had to order a banh mi with pate and pulled chicken instead. The filling to bread ratio was also pretty off, but was still tasty nonetheless. I might come here again, but for takeout only."
98,8,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,12/4/2021,"It's a great experience. The ambiance is very welcoming and charming.Try their signature Banh Mi and Pho, you won't be disappointed!!!"
99,9,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/7/2022,"This is a great spot for Pho, Spring Rolls, or any other staple Vietnamese dish. I feel this spot doesn't get the credit it deserves due to its close proximity to Pho Basil, and the neighborhood Taylor's mostly to college kids. Kids of this age might not have yet developed the pallet for such tasty and culture enriched foods, or have the money! I feel their dishes are fairly priced! I highly recommend this place if you're in the area! It's been really quiet the last few times I went and I hope they make it!!"
100,10,Saigon Fusion,2 star rating,10/22/2021,"Arrived at 5:30, the place was empty. The staff did not know we were there a few minutes later. I like how the menu is simple but the service is really slow. We placed our order, we ordered strawberry ade and avocado smoothie, signature banh mi, and 2 kids pho with ribs added. After 30 minutes of waiting, we almost finish our drink. banh mi still has not arrived yet. Finally, two customers came and our banh mi arrived, which is unacceptable banh mi should me a quick service especially we were the only customers there with no take out orders. The banh mi is tasty but the portion is small for the price but this is what you should expect at Mass Ave. By the time we finished our banh mi, our pho still have not arrived yet. All tables are taken after we are 45 minutes there and finally our pho arrives. With the kid's size, the portion is perfect for us since we finish our drink and share the banh mi. The beef is so tender since they use steaks instead of beef briskets or fatty beef that most Vietnamese restaurants used for their pho. We added ribs which were soft, delicious and this is the main reason want to try their pho. For the total, it was nearly $56. The boss who did not give us was holding on to our card after giving us the receipt to sign. I don't know if she forgot our card is in her hand or not because the card is wrapped with the customer receipt. By the time we leave the place, only one table had food on the table... Don't expect this place to serve food fast even with limited items on the menu like other Vietnamese restaurants with large selections on the menu or those banh mi shops for quick bites."
101,11,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,4/24/2021,"TAKE OUT REVIEW - order ahead !

If you're in the mood for Vietnamese come here. If you're in the mood for delicious thin meat slices either in soup or bread come here. Just come. 

Please come here on a weekday for a swift meal. Weekend especially Saturday night will *not* be the best time. It is a small restaurant and everyone already knows how delicious it is, so your order will be delayed and you won't get a table. Socially distanced seating means there are only like 5 tables inside and one table outside. If you must then make a reservation and bring your patience. 

Take out pho ($13.95) comes with separately packaged soup, bean sprout / greens, noodles in a bowl, and meat wrapped in paper. Very thoughtful. Different cuts of meat come in the pho and the raw thinly sliced meat comes separately packaged. Once you pour the soup in the bowl, the meat will cook in that beef broth and it will compliment your noodles with that tender bite. 

Take out signature banh mi ($8.00) comes with pate, jambon, and shredded chicken. There isn't much of the typical pickled carrots and daikon but so much more of meat than usual. And they're seasoned incredibly. This is one of the best (if not the best) banh mi I've had. The baguette is also quite nice. I want to eat this banh mi again tomorrow. I really love this sandwich. Plus that price - 100% recommend. 

Let's support precious local businesses."
102,12,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,10/10/2021,"Best pho and banh mi place I've found so far in Boston. Their menu is small but good. I've been here twice, once for banh mi and another for pho. Their food is a little different (for instance, the banh mi didn't include like, picked carrots or cucumber) but presented very well and really fresh. As for the pho, the broth was very flavorful and the small size was filling for me. I also tried some of a friend's rice dish and it was really good, too, so I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you decide to order.

A tip, though: seating is limited and it get can very busy, so I'd call ahead if you have a group (I had a group of just 4 and still had to wait 20 or so minutes for seating). Also, if it's later in the day, it might be a good idea to call and ask if they still have pho broth. I went in one evening just to find out they didn't have pho available.

EDIT: ANOTHER TIP: CALL BEFORE YOU GO. I've gone 5 times over the past few months, on different days, and they were closed 3/5 times (1 was due to an unforeseen issue so not their fault, but the other two times, they were closed on days that google, yelp, etc. said they would be open, only to see that they were closed with no notice why. I don't know if they've changed their hours or something, but it's made it frustrating to eat here."
103,13,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,11/5/2021,"I enjoyed the fresh spring rolls with grilled pork, served with wonderful dipping sauce. I ate a bowl of beef  noodle soup with fabulous broth."
104,14,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,1/23/2021,Was randomly craving a banh mi and this was the only place open at the time. So happy I stumbled upon here because their banh mi was delicious! I got the cold cut. I also got their Vietnamese iced coffee which was also very well made! They did fill the cup up with a lot of ice though. I will definitely come here again!
105,15,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,4/20/2021,"This is possibly one of my new favorite restaurants in Boston and some of the best pho & spring rolls I've had. Next time you don't know what to eat for lunch/dinner go here!

The pho tasted so clean and flavorful. The quality of meat was unexpectedly good -- it was super tender and noticeably better than what your average pho has. 11/10.
The spring rolls were crisp, fresh, and was really good with the sauce. 10/10!

I definitely will be coming more regularly and hope to try the banh mi and the rice plate soon :)"
106,16,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,7/29/2021,"Easy 5 stars. 

ORDER AHEAD, they take their time cooking it up. 30 min pickup and like a 5 min wait when I got there. If you're impatient like that and order from here, don't leave a 1 star review because you had to wait an extra 10 minutes for your food. It's delicious and worth the wait 

Great spot to swing by after work. Got grilled chicken rice plate and chicken Bahn mi. Chicken rice plate is really good- fresh veggies and ingredients, everything is delicious, chicken is tender, flavor is on point. Grilled chicken bahn mi was also delicious. Well balanced flavors with fresh veggies 

Also, seems to be family run. That's always a plus for me"
107,17,Saigon Fusion,2 star rating,11/22/2021,"Food was good, nothing extraordinary. Portions were a bit small for the price ($15.50 for a bowl of phone and an extra $5.50 if you want to add a single rib). Service was absolutely horrible. When my boyfriend and I got there at 6:30pm on a Monday night, the one single waitress working there told us there were no tables available, practically shooing us out the door. I then asked if there was a waitlist to which she then said yes there's about a 30 minute wait and one party ahead of you. We didn't mind waiting the 30 minutes, so we waited and eventually were seated at 7pm, we placed our order around 7:10pm but didn't receive water or our apps (1 order of shrimp spring rolls and 1 order of grilled pork banh mi) until7:30pm and 7:45pm respectively. We waited until 8:20pm for 2 orders of the kid size pho ($11) and then approached the waitress to get our check and our order of pho to go. There were multiple times during our dinning experience that the waitress turned down customers well before (35 minutes) closing and dining customers asked about their orders/ requested their orders for take out instead of dine in. I understand there is a lack of restaurant staff shortage but communication is key and our waitress did not communicate with us. Overall, would not come back until more wait and kitchen staff have been hired. 

Also, you can walk 2 minutes down the street to Pho Basil and get a tasty large bowl of pho for $12 and good service (even on a busy Saturday night)."
108,18,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,11/7/2020,"Spectacular customer service. A+

Social distancing is here and enforced. Indoor and outdoor dining. A+

The banh mi's are the best. Had the generally accepted ones in Dorchester. These sandwiches surpassed it easily. The pate is made in house. The baguette is not but it is on point. The choice of proteins are excellent as well.  A+

The pho is A1! Broth is simmered for 20 hours. Definitely the best bowl of soup, rice noodles, and protein in massachusetts. The bowl is 13.95 but it's worth it - it's considered self care. Outstanding bowl . A+

Salted limeade is house made. Great for a sore throat too A+++++
Tangerine soda house made. Better than your favorite soda. A+++"

I showed up 15 minutes later and they told me 45 minutes after they charged me. They refunded me, but still annoying."
111,21,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,12/26/2021,"The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because it always seems to be understaffed or closed at random times. I think that it is run by two people and they close due to maintenance or personal reasons but there is no way to know this unless you physically go to the restaurant and then realize that you have to go somewhere else instead. The food here is amazing, especially the pho. I honestly think this is the best pho I have had in Boston. I would recommend it for their pho to anyone but like I said, I would call ahead of time to make sure they are open."
112,22,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,10/23/2020,"If you love Pho (Beef noodle soup) and I am talking about the quality authentic one, you must try this place! Nowadays most restaurants make it lucrative by not spending enough time to slow cook the broth from real ingredients but use lots of seasonings to make it taste good... I'm so glad I finally found this rare gem where I can enjoy the real quality authentic Pho. 
Try this place and you will learn how a ""real"" Pho should taste like!"
113,23,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,11/6/2021,"Pretty good pho, better than most places in Boston. The service was a bit slow because busy and portion size was on the lower end."
114,24,Saigon Fusion,1 star rating,11/8/2021,This is the first time I give such a low rating. I would say zero service. No servers at all. wait 10 min to get a seat. wait another 10 minute to order. Only 3 types of food available. The female server is not respecting us at all Worst experience. DONT TRY！！
115,25,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,12/15/2021,"We come here literally every weekend. My favorites are the pho, grilled pork banh mi, and toffee coffee. People saying the service is awful obviously don't realize this is a small family-owned business. The kitchen is tiny and we were told they can only fit 2 people in there at once. Sure, the wait time is long, but if you call ahead you can place your order then or get a reservation. Don't trust the reviews that say Pho Basil down the block is equally as good, because it's not, and it's also not even owned by Vietnamese people. The pho at Saigon Fusion is next level and a million times better than Pho Basil, Pho Pasteur, Pho Hoa, Pho Le, and literally every other Vietnamese restaurant combined in Boston. But honestly, other people can stay going to those other places so Saigon Fusion doesn't become blow up and become even busier!"
116,26,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,5/18/2021,I think the food here is good but not super authentic. The pho broth was pretty bland but I do appreciate the fresh cuts of meat. The banh mi had good pate but they didn't even offer the classic cold cut option. I'd come back but the prices are pretty steep for Vietnamese food.
117,27,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/12/2021,"The Bahn Mi, simply put, is something you need to try. Filled with grilled Jabon, fresh vegetables, and encased in a wonderfully crisp baguette, this is an incredible sandwich at a reasonable price. If I were to choose between this and a burger, this would win any day of the week. If you're a pate fan, please do yourself a favor and come here--they make it in-house."
118,28,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,10/5/2021,"They ran out of pho!! I don't know how but we tried ordering 4 bowls of pho, and they only had 3. Anyway, they don't immediately offer chopsticks and you have to ask for them. The food is good, but does take a long time for it to come out. Service is kind of slow."
119,29,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/16/2021,"We decided to try this place out as it is down the street from pho basil. Parking was a little challenging but we got take out so it wasn't a problem. We ordered grilled pork spring rolls and the sauce that comes with it is not a peanut sauce, more like a sweet duck sauce. We also ordered the pho which was packaged nicely. The noodles and beef were packaged in a ready to eat bowl with the pho broth on the side. The rare steak was so tender and the broth was so flavorful without needing any hoisin/sriracha. I loved that the noodles were cooked al dente. I only wish that they gave us more beansprouts and basil. We also tried the banh mi sandwich with grilled pork. The portion size is a little smaller than a banh mi you'd expect in Dorchester but it was very good!! Overall food is tasty, a bit on the pricier side for viet food, but considering the location it's reasonable."
120,30,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/8/2022,honestly one of the best pho places in boston. owner is incredibly sweet and takes great pride in using fresh ingredients and making food on the spot. the pho is simply delicious and the broth is very deep and flavorful. customer service is great and could not complain. the bahn mi is also very good and i recommend everything.
121,31,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,9/1/2021,"Tasty but far too slow.  We arrived late for lunch on a Wednesday. Only one other table was filled so we figured it would be a quick bite. We ordered right away but it took almost 30 minutes to get our summer roll and another 10 for a banh mi sandwich and pho. Everything was good, but I just can't push the review stars any higher with such a long wait."

123,33,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"I'm Vietnamese and have eaten V food all over including Vietnam, Orange County, San Jose. This is one of my best V experiences. Amazing pho broth. The right herbs, spices, real bone broth. Fresh spring rolls have the right ratio.  Even the rice plate was the bomb. Order everything. The banh mi sandwich is a different than typical, less crunchy, more meaty. Smaller, but tender. It's a formula from their five banh mi locations in their Vietnam home town (Canh Tho, I believe). 

Warning, the kitchen is really slow, but you'll taste why."
124,34,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,6/17/2021,"this small restaurant is quite easy to simply walk by and miss, but it honestly has some of the best viet food that i've ever had!
-they don't have an official website or anything, so there's no direct way to order delivery/pickup. however, you can probably call them to place an order in advance. we came to the restaurant in person to place an order for takeout.
-there's no outdoor seating, and just a couple of tables inside the restaurant. basically all of the tables were occupied by 6 pm on a weekday.
-we paid with card, but i think they accept cash as well.
-while the workers here are friendly and welcoming, our food took a really long time to make. they originally told us that it would only be a 30 minute wait, but we ended up waiting for a whole hour. while it was kind of an inconvenience since we were in a rush to leave, they also had a lot of customers to take care of at the time. 

4/29/21
-grilled pork banh mi 7: this banh mi has grilled minced pork along with some other veggies (cucumber, scallion, leek, cilantro, etc). the style of this banh mi is also quite different from the banh mis in nyc, since it didn't seem to have any pickled carrots/daikon. the baguette was toasted just the right amount, but a bit thinner/flatter in size; i remember it was around 8-9 inches in length? the grilled pork was sooo flavorful and definitely one of the best tasting banh mis that i've ever had. it was only $7, which is cheaper than many places in nyc. (4.5/5)
-signature banh mi: their signature banh mi has a combination of pate, jombon (vietnamese ham), pulled chicken, along with the same veggies as the other banh mi. it was also really good! the meat was cooked just the right amount and tasted great. other than that, it was pretty much the same as the grilled pork banh mi in terms of the size and baguette. this one was more expensive at $8, but was still worth it imo. (4.5/5)
-grilled shrimp spring rolls: each spring roll was pretty long and had three pieces of large shrimp inside, along with thin vermicelli noodles, ban sprouts, mint, and pickled daikon/carrots. the chopped peanuts and peanut sauce on the side was really great as well. i felt like $5.75 was a relatively fair price for these, but there wasn't anything particularly special about them. (3.5/5)
-grilled chicken rice bowl: this bowl had grilled chicken, broken rice, a fried egg, pickled daikon/carrots, cucumber, tomatoes, mixed greens, green onions, and fish sauce. this meal was super balanced and had a fair amount of protein compared to the fresh veggies and rice. it tasted even better with the sauce! it was also very filling for $12.50. (4/5)

overall, i definitely would've given this place 5 stars if our food didn't take so long to make. i can see myself coming back here pretty often in the future, especially since most of their menu options are reasonably priced and filling. 
my favorites that i would recommend you must try would be their grilled pork banh mi and the signature banh mi."
125,35,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,11/19/2020,"This place seems absolutely heavenly when you walk in, which is how my roommate and I got hooked and we can't envision ever going back to the days when we didn't know about Saigon Fusion.

First off, they have almost 0 online presence and have a Microsoft Word document menu with like 6 items. That's how you know it's LEGIT.

Their spring rolls are authentic - I would go light on the mint because it can be pretty overpowering flavor wise. The banh mi is perfection - be careful because the spice seems tolerable and then you get a bite of pepper and it just whacks you in the throat. The pho is amazing but don't wait too long to pick up your order as the broth can get cold. 

Space is quite small and during COVID, I would recommend picking up if you're worried about distancing (as you should be)."
126,36,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,11/22/2021,"Decent food but awful service. They are randomly closed for no reason, sometime when you call their chef isn't in and so they can't take orders (???), and pickup can take up to 1 hour. They're also always out of jambon (then why have it on their menu?). I rarely write reviews but their absurd business model convinced me to tell the world how bad it is."

129,39,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/23/2020,"Such a nice surprise! I don't normally do reviews, but after this amazing meal and speaking with the sweet staff, I feel compelled to share this little gem. 

My friend and I were walking down Mass Ave to get pho from pho basil, and stumbled upon this place on our way. We decided to step in and try it instead. Since we were starving, we decided to both order pho and share the Bahn mi as an appetizer. The Bahn mi is amazing! The bread was warm and fresh, as if it were just pulled from the oven. It had a nice soft crunch to the outside and the ingredients in the sandwich were so fresh and flavorful.

The pho was also phenomenal as well. You can tell that they care a lot about the quality of the ingredients they use. I think this may be my new favorite place! FYI, they're going to be adding more menu items later with pastries and cakes to add to the cafe atmosphere. Looking forward to checking that out! Thank you again for such an amazing meal :)"
130,40,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,2/25/2020,"Third time (or is it fourth?) time mig. Be a charm for the space long seeking an identity 

Good fresh shrimp spring rolls and under $13 pho is a decent deal.

Not sure I loved the 90s throwback soundtrack Celine Dions ""Let's Talk About Love"", with all its Jim Steinman bombastic-ness. Maybe it was being played ironically :) 

They are so new they don't have menus printed up so you have to peer around at blackboards to see what's to order - its kind of charming, actually."
131,41,Saigon Fusion,2 star rating,11/29/2021,"I didn't have a good dining experience. We ordered two bowls of pho, a banh mi with cold cuts, and two smoothies. We first received our smoothies. I liked the flavor and appreciated the use of real strawberries/bananas and avocado. However, I think the smoothies could have been blended for an extra minute or so because I found the smoothie was gritty from the small chunks of ice throughout. I'm not sure why but we were never offered any water or tea during our meal or checked up on if we needed anything. It took another 30-35 minutes for the banh mi to come out. The sandwich is pretty good and I would get it again because they used the correct bread, tasty meat, and pate. We waited another 15 minutes for our bowls of pho and I was pretty disappointed by the portion size, considering that each bowl is $15 (which is very high for pho). The full size bowl of pho here is comparable to a kids size at other restaurants. Unfortunately, the taste of the broth does not make up for much. I would not recommend the pho because there are not many cuts of meat and the broth tastes strange. Overall, I don't think I would come again despite enjoying the banh mi sandwich just because the service here is very slow. It's impractical to try to swing by for lunch and get a banh mi for pick up because it takes like 30-40 minutes. In addition, there are not many options on the menu. Despite having a lean menu, the restaurant also didn't have any of the rice plates in stock, so our food options were even more limited."
132,42,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,11/28/2020,"Phenomenal ! They only have 4 dishes which is rice , banh mi , pho and spring roll. And just pork and chicken for choices ; sadly.  We of course ordered all of it. The pho is flavorful . The rice is cooked prefect the banh mi was crunchy and the spring roll they used banh hoi which is a very refreshing way to make it because they are the only one that use banh hoi. But they portion is smaller then most restaurants."

I had the pho. It had a really nice portion of meat, savory taste, and the side herbs were great! Not only did I get the regular sprouts, basil, and lime BUT there was sawgrass and one more (don't know the name) that added an extra something delicious you won't get at other pho places.
The owner came to say Hi and ask how I enjoyed my food. She was sweet and friendly. A very nice touch!
I will definitely be coming back and bringing a friend"

Didn't think much of it given how many restaurants are around mainly catering to students in the area, but this is some of the best Vietnamese food I've had in Boston. Small menu but they do everything right. Banh mi is great, pho is delicious. Since it's a small operation I've sometimes had to wait a bit longer for takeout but it's worth it in the end."
136,46,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,10/11/2020,"I went on a whim as I was walking by because everyone at their outdoor seating had such delicious looking food and it had been a while since I went out for Vietnamese food. 
Everything was delicious. The Pho soup was incredible, my boyfriend ordered it but I insisted we share after tasting it & the baguette sandwich we ordered was delicious. Perfectly spicy but not too much. I forgot to mention we started with their spring rolls which were so fresh! Our waitress suggested their tangerine soda, made in-house and it was so tasty! Like a health Fanta, but better.

We overheard a conversation between the cashier and another patron saying they opened in February and today was the first day they were able to open post quarantine. Wow I must say, they had everything running smoothly and with such delicious food! I recommend their food to everyone! Such a wonderful, quality business and delicious restaurant to support."
137,47,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/12/2021,Worth the value! Excellent service. Fresh spring rolls is very delicious! Love it. I'll definitely coming back.
138,48,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,1/13/2021,"Since we've found Saigon Fusion a month ago, my husband and I have been here once every week. The food is really that good. Being Vietnamese myself, I have unreasonably high standards for Vietnamese restaurants and this place meets it. Every. Single. Time. The spring rolls are very authentic with different herbs and homemade fish sauce. The phở broth is so clean and delicious. The bánh mì is out of this world. The owner told us how she makes everything to order to ensure freshness and quality, that's why things can take a little longer to come out, but oh so worth it! We already plan to come back for more this weekend."
139,49,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/7/2021,The best Bahn Mi sandwich!!! Great place and fair prices. Absolutely my favorite in Boston area
140,50,Saigon Fusion,4 star rating,2/22/2020,"It feels weird calling this place a hidden gem when it's actually in a prime location right on Massachusetts Ave, a block away from Symphony Hall. But the restaurant seems to have struggled a bit to find its footing, based on its Yelp page: one early review complains about inconsistent menu offerings; the name and description (inaccurately) refers to the cuisine as a fusion of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Thai flavors; and even the menu photos seem out of date, picturing ramen bowls and other Japanese-influenced appetizers alongside unique banh mi combos. While the promise of fusion food intrigued me, the mixed messages put off my Vietnamese girlfriend, and we nearly passed over eating here for Saturday brunch.

We took our chances though, and left impressed and impressively full. In an ironic twist, this latest (and hopefully last) iteration of Saigon Fusion's menu features no-nonsense Vietnamese specialties--if you're looking for fusion, you're better off going to Pho Basil a block away. 

We started off by splitting a pate and jambon (ham) banh mi ($7.50) between us as an appetizer, and followed it up with a bowl of pho ($12.50) each. The pho was good and came with high quality cuts of beef, but we both agreed it was the banh mi that stole the show--the baguette was perfectly crusty on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside, and filled with enough well-mixed pate and aioli to make every bite a delight. The surprising lack of pickled carrots and radish didn't even register as a disappointment, since the mix of fresh veggies that were included more than made up for it. 

The price point is a bit high for Vietnamese food, but reasonable for the area, and again the food is of genuinely high quality. My girlfriend adored the aesthetics of the place too: cute little pots of live flowers served as a centerpiece on each table, the chalk-drawn menus struck a fine balance between artsy and informative, and the music (a lot of classic French love songs) elevated our casual dining experience to just this side of classy. Really loved what they're doing here, and will definitely come again."
141,51,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/8/2020,"I love the pho noodles here! The broth had been simmered for many hours and has a rich complex flavor. The beef is fresh, tender, and flavorful. 

Beautiful interior. Friendly and attentive staff.

The place seemed to have change owners recently but kept the same name. Now it only serves quality authentic Vietnamese food. No fusion nonsense. The new menu serves pho noodles, grilled pork rice plate, Vietnamese sandwiches, and some appetizers. 

This is a hidden gem. A notch better than the overcrowded Pho Basil nearby in my opinion."
142,52,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,12/1/2020,HIDDEN GEM for Vietnamese food!! I love this family owned restaurant. Take it from someone who has high standards for her Viet food- this place gives my mom's food a run for her money. Very authentic pho. You can tell everything is made with care from the dine-in presentation to pick up packaging. A+ COVID precautions. Looking for a tasty small business restaurant to support? Look no further.
143,53,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,6/4/2021,I've been looking for a good Bahn Mi shop ever since my favorite store in Chinatown closed down due to COVID. Saigon Fusion hit the spot with some solid Bahn Mi sandwiches. Will definitely be back again!
144,54,Saigon Fusion,3 star rating,5/9/2021,"I want to give a better review, I really do. But waiting more than an hour for takeout pickup is not okay. It's not crowded. We ordered before noon so before the lunchtime rush. No good explanation given."
145,55,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,4/26/2021,thought the pho broth was comparable to some in the bay area (which is a good thing) - definitely the best broth ive had in boston
146,56,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,10/28/2020,"Actually authentic, delicious Vietnamese food. Being Vietnamese myself, I am picky and always compare the food to my mom's cooking. Saigon fusion comes close. Glad to have stumbled upon this gem."
147,57,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,11/28/2020,"Hands down the best Vietnamese food in the Boston area! All dishes are extremely fresh and vivid. Because they don't do delivery yet and I don't live nearby, every time I visit I try taking out as much as food as I could, usually a few Banh Mis which I toast in my oven and they taste as good as if I had them dining in!"
148,58,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/1/2021,"As someone who is Vietnamese, I'm thrilled to say their food is amazing and authentic, and the business is run by fantastic owners. They were very busy last weekend so the wait time was a bit longer, and the owner made us some free thai tea to thank us for our patience. Great service and quality bánh mì for reasonable prices, I highly recommend!"
149,59,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/24/2020,Saigon Fusion is under new ownership so our family stopped to grab a bite to eat. I highly recommend the pho (which was packed with flavor) and the Banh Mi that was fresh. This is some of the most authentic Vietnamese food you can get in this area. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great! The quality and amount of food you get is fair to the prices. I'll be back many more times! It was such a positive experience eating here.
150,60,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/15/2020,"Food and service were both excellent.  Pho was fantastic -- broth was hearty without being overly salty/greasy, quality of beef was great (not stringy or chewy like other places). I also liked the accompaniments for the soup -- not the standard Thai basil but some unique herbs and veggies that elevated the pho.  

Also tried one of the Banh mi sandwiches, something that is lacking in this area.  Bread was warm, and just the right texture (not too crumbly and for once, my jaw and upper mouth did not hurt afterward). Happy to not have to trek all the way to Allston or Chinatown from now on. 

Really happy to have this authentic Vietnamese place nearby and will definitely come again.  Service was warm, attentive and prompt.  Decor is warm and bright, and much cleaner than a lot of the other restaurants on the block. 

PS:  Strawberry milk and orange soda drinks were also great!"
151,61,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,1/31/2021,Amazing food! Amazing owners!! They're so friendly and the food is spectacular. My friend I went with loved the banh mi so much she bought a second one to eat later!!! Definitely support this business!!
152,62,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/17/2020,"Don't miss this charming little Vietnamese cafe when in the Symphony neighborhood. Simply delicious pho, really the best I have ever had!  The flavor notes in the broth are simple yet complex and the accouterments are super fresh and fragrant. I can't wait to go back. I bet there'll be a line out the door!"
153,63,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,10/10/2020,"Woohoo!!  They are OPEN again after closing in March. While they were closed, we got take out from so many different Vietnamese places all around Boston and we couldn't find Vietnamese food better than this.  This is a family-run business and everything they make tastes super fresh. Their soup is fragrant with herbs, their meat is high quality, and the bread for the sandwiches is homemade. Truly a gem in this neighborhood and not to be missed!"
154,64,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/17/2020,"Boy I needed a bowl of pho and here it is. Delicious. The greens were so fresh and tart. Lovely, homey place to relax. Forgot to add, they serve a fantastic cup of green tea"
155,65,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,12/29/2020,My cousins and I dined here during a trip to Boston. We are three Vietnamese born and raised in Vietnam. I all agreed this is the best pho we had ever since we move to the States. If you look for good pho this is the place!
156,66,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,12/24/2020,Best fresh Spring Rolls I've had.  I also like the grilled rice plate.  They are friendly and I wish them the best!  They gave me a cookie and a free iced coffee on Christmas Even when I got take out.
157,67,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/8/2020,Best pho in Boston proper. I have visited every weekend and the taste is always consistent!
158,68,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,3/4/2020,Best Ph around. Perfect place to hang out with friends. Don't forget to try bánh mì and rice plate too.
159,69,Saigon Fusion,5 star rating,2/28/2020,"This is a very new restaurant, but they're getting off to a strong start! Some of the best and freshest spring rolls and egg rolls I've ever had. The báhn mi had fantastic well toasted bread and delicious ingredients. Beef pho was also amazing! Staff was extremely friendly and welcoming to a larger party. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Boston."
160,0,GRECO,5 star rating,2/27/2022,"This place is popular for a reason! We get delivery from here often because their food travels well and tastes almost equivalent to how it would if you physically ate it in the establishment. My boyfriend and I love getting the mixed grill. It is amazing because it gives you the opportunity to try many of their different meats - loukaniko (sausage), bifteki (ground beef), lamb chop, chicken and pork gyro. It also comes with the spicy feta, tzatziki, fries, tomatoes, onions, and pita bread. Not only does it taste amazing but it is such a great value!! 

Also highly recommend their zucchini chips - they are sliced super thin and fried to perfection! We also love the yaya's loukoumades (Greek donuts) that are drenched in Nutella, Oreo bits, and powdered sugar!"
161,1,GRECO,4 star rating,2/2/2022,"This was my first visit to a Greco location, and it was an enjoyable workweek lunch experience! I ordered the pork plate w zucchini chips (also pictured is my partner's order: a lamb plate w french fries) --

TASTE: 3.5/5 - the pork could've used a little more flavor, but the lamb was chef's kiss
TEXTURE: 4/5 - the contrast between the tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki was really nice, and the zucchini chips were fire!
PRICE: 4/5 - mostly because I was happy to use my $25 gift card. Note: currently, gift cards can only be redeemed in-store, and not on the Greco app!
SERVING SIZE: 5/5 - pleasantly larger portions than I expected, so twas a lot of food for me!
SERVICE: 4/5 - not many folks there around noon on a Wednesday, and we got our takeout shortly after ordering
ATMOSPHERE: 3.5/5 - located below ground level, and the inside is cute and minimal
TAKEOUT: 4/5 - containers are compostable, a plus!
PARKING: 4/5 - got lucky w a metered spot a block away on Newbury"
162,2,GRECO,4 star rating,1/7/2022,"Came here with my friend on New Year's Eve just before noon. We were able to beat the rush of people who came in following us. There were a couple of small spaces to sit down and eat as well as outside, but given that it was cold and raining, those seats weren't available. 

The workers were super friendly and quick as preparing the food. My friend ordered the lamb bowl with zucchini chips and tzatziki while I had the pork gyro with spicy feta. Trying a bit of both of our foods, I did prefer the pork over the lamb. Although equally as flavorful, I found the pork more tender and moist. The gyro was a fun and convenient way to eat since it was so compact and efficient at having a bit of pork, fries, tomato and feta in every bite. The pita was soft and I really enjoyed the zucchini chips which were crisp, perfect for the light tzatziki sauce. 

For dessert, we shared the loukoumades with custard, pistachios, honey and shaved filo. The toppings were good but other I could tell the loukoumades weren't fries and given time to soak up the honey like other homemade versions I've had before. In addition, I'm not sure if it was the filo or pistachios that were almost rock like when eating. 

Would come again to try more items from their menu."
163,3,GRECO,4 star rating,4/5/2022,"I stopped by around noon and shouldv'e definitely ordered online for pick up to avoid lunch traffic. I ordered the veggie plate with fries and the classic loukoumades (greek style doughnuts). The wait wasn't too bad, considering it was peak lunch hour. The veggie plate was super filling. I'm not sure I would order the classic loukoumades again because they were doused in so much honey, so it was too sweet for my liking. I would come back to try the other two toppings though."
164,4,GRECO,4 star rating,4/3/2022,"Solid meal; I would say it's more like a 3.5. I ordered the classic lamb pita with Greco fries. I think the classic lamb pita was a bit too oily for my liking and could have been better if it had lettuce or tomatoes or another fresh ingredient--I think it only came with meat, onions, and sauce. Although I appreciate how much meat there was, I think a balance of veggies and meat would have been better. The meat was actually pretty tender and well seasoned; sometimes I am skeptical of lamb since it can be tough if not cooked properly. I did like the tzatziki sauce it came with, it tasted homemade and creamy. The Greco fries were nothing special. I was expecting a little more seasoning or toppings besides the cheese and maybe oregano."
165,5,GRECO,3 star rating,3/30/2022,"I had the veggie wrap of zucchini fritters, fries and sauces and got some zucchini chips on the side. The wrap became difficult to eat at the end because of the sauce that was not well distributed. The chips were not evenly seasoned, leaving some to be fantastic, and others to be bland."
166,6,GRECO,4 star rating,12/2/2021,"Greco is a great option for quick counter-service food on Newbury Street that's not too overpriced (at least by Newbury standards!).

The menu here is comprised of gyros, salads, BYO plates, innovative sides, and even some Greek doughnuts (was too full to try on my first visit, but sounded really tasty!).

I tried the loukaniko (pork/leek sausage) wrap, and it was definitely a winner. The sausage was flavorful and juicy, and the fries/potatoes on the wrap were perfectly fresh. My only tiny gripe was that the sausage was super salty, but about halfway through I got used to it - and overall it was still a great wrap.

I tried a few of my friend's zucchini chips, and would definitely recommend those as well - light, very thinly sliced, and one of those rare fried snacks that doesn't actually feel greasy at all.

The food comes up quick, and the indoor space, although small, wasn't overly crowded on a weekday night around dinner time (maybe we just got lucky?)

It also seems they do a lot of takeout orders - honestly, if I lived closer, I'd be hitting this place up all the time for takeout."
167,7,GRECO,4 star rating,11/1/2021,"For a quick work lunch this Monday noon I walked over to Greco. Walking past the outdoor seating on street level and descending a half flight of stairs, I reached the interior, which possessed the light wood, large windows, and exposed concrete necessary for new, trendy restaurants (aka ""industrial chic""). 

My order consisted of the following
- Loukaniko Pita | $10.50
- Zucchini Chips | $4.5

Originally, I planned on ordering the lamb gyro. However, the Loukaniko Pita, with pork and leek sausage, caught my eye. The sausage had the same texture and grill char as other gyro (like beef), but with a much sweeter savoriness. (imagine the difference between normal ground pork and a ground pork and leek or cabbage dumpling). That, cut by mustard, proved satisfying. I initially thought the portion size too small, but I underestimated the staying power of pita bread and ""hand cut potatoes"" (read: fries) inside the pita. 

The zucchini fries tasted like crack - of the salt and oil variety. I appreciated the rendering of a vegetable into something unhealthy.

On a side note, gyro with fries seemed quite Californian. I did not expect to find it here."
168,8,GRECO,4 star rating,9/19/2021,"We wanted to try a new dessert and this came up in the recommendations. We ordered the Loukoumades(Greek donuts). This was a Saturday night(~7:30) and the place was packed, line almost out the door. Took about 20 mins to order and receive our donuts. 

Classic(Greek honey, walnuts and cinnamon) - the honey tasted off to me. 
Papous(matisha creme and pistachios) - this was really good, would come back for this and try their other two flavors."
169,9,GRECO,5 star rating,8/29/2021,"I'm very impressed by the food and the extremely fast service. The prices are not bad at all for a fast-casual spot on Newbury!

Came here on a hot weekday evening. The indoor seating was completely full and the cooks were busy preparing takeout orders. I got a bifteki pita wrap ($10.50) and bougatsa loukoumades ($7). My order was done in about 10 minutes. I noticed that others who only ordered pita wraps got their orders within a minute of paying-- the donuts probably take more time.

There are small tables outside to sit at and I highly recommend grabbing a small stack of napkins from the store if you plan to eat outside. The pita wrap was stuffed with meat and fries and was a bit messy to eat.

The bifteki was hearty and very flavorful. I loved the spicy feta it came with (and they gave a lot of it). The fries were crispy and nicely seasoned, too.

Even if I happened to eat dinner somewhere else, I'd come here just for their loukoumades. The donuts are soft and chewy (almost reminded me of mochi donuts). The bougatsa (custard creme, phyllo, cinnamon) was not too sweet. I could honestly eat the entire box by myself. I'll have to try their other flavors sometime soon."
170,10,GRECO,5 star rating,8/24/2021,"I've seen Greco's loukoumades all over TikTok and knew I had to give them a try!

I ordered the classic pork gyro and the kataifi loukoumades. The pork gyro was very flavorful and delicious! I really liked that the French fries were included inside the gyro! The loukoumades were also delicious! I really liked the pistachio chunks with the donut pieces! 

Overall, I really enjoyed everything I ate and would definitely come back. I think I'm going to try to lamb gyro with Yaya's loukoumades next!"
171,11,GRECO,5 star rating,8/14/2021,"Gyro, but make it a salad. Traditional gyros, salads, spanakopita-inspired flaky spring rolls, and so much more. This place is filled with so many tasty options  it was honestly hard to choose, BUT gyros are always a good choice & the fresh veggies + tzatziki made this a must! 

Loved the lamb and other meats roasting on the spits behind the counter. Location itself is fast-casual with some indoor seating, outdoor patio, and to-go options. Friendly staff, fast service, delicious food!"
172,12,GRECO,5 star rating,8/12/2021,"Came in right as they opened and was greeted warmly by the employees. I enjoyed the Classic Chicken Gyro with flavorful chicken meat and freshly fried french fries. I also had to treat myself to the Yaya's, which was like a mini donut, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was covered in praline and sprinkled with oreo crumbs. It was very sweet and absolutely delectable.

I waited less than 10 minutes for my order and was then on my way. Definitely a great place to grab a bite!"
173,13,GRECO,4 star rating,5/17/2021,"The yayas loukamades were the star of the show. I wouldn't say it's the ""best dessert I ever had"" but it definitely satisfies one dimension of cravings and was without a doubt really really delicious. It tastes like an elevated version of the funnel cakes we used to get at the carnival when we were younger, golden and crisp on the outside and super soft, doughnuty and airy, fluffy, and soaked with a delightful sweet syrup on the inside that brings so much joy.

The gyro itself was really good, but not the best in the world I would say. My friend got the lamb and it was a little dry; I got the bifteki and would definitely recommend that over the lamb as the beef was more soft and juicy. My favorite part of the gyro was definitely the fries though as they were so crisp and added the perfect unique texture to the gyro. The tzatziki and spicy feta was really refreshing in contrast to the somewhat dry doughy-ness of the pita bread! 

Would come back for the loukamades :)"
174,14,GRECO,3 star rating,10/24/2021,I thought it was just okay tbh. I had the lamb gyro plate with fries and thought the lamb was dry and fairly flavorless. Others in the party had the chicken gyro and the pork which I thought both were better. Maybe I had a bad batch? Nice seating area outside right on Newberry anyway.
175,15,GRECO,5 star rating,8/3/2021,"Where has this place been all my life?? Ever since I went to Greece 5 years ago, I've been searching for an authentic Greek gyro like the ones I had every day in little roadside shacks, and I'm thrilled to discover it here on Newbury Street of all places. I got the classic pork gyro and savored every bite. Every component worked in perfect harmony, but the pork was especially good--all tender, crispy, and fatty. If I had to nitpick, I'd say I wish there were more fries, but overall I was very happy. This is what Saloniki in Fenway wishes they could be. It was a lot of food for one person and very reasonably priced for a fast, casual dinner. 

They also have a nice and decently sized patio right on Newbury Street for great people-watching on a nice day. The service was shockingly fast on a weekday night. By the time I paid for my order, I barely had time to glance at my phone, before they were calling it out. The guy at the register was also very pleasant and made ordering really easy. I would love to come back and try the loukoumades which I also haven't had since my Greece trip. On a street full of bustling restaurants, this place is super underrated!"
176,16,GRECO,5 star rating,9/24/2021,"If you want good greek food prepared quick - this is it! Gyro's, salads, delicious sides and the most amazing greek donuts. Lots of options to choose from. Service always quick and friendly. Indoor and Outdoor seating available."
177,17,GRECO,4 star rating,9/4/2021,This place is GOOOOD! If you're in the mood for a quick bite without the commitment of dining in at a place- this is for you! I would order any of the classic pitas. The loukoumas (greek style donuts) remind me of beignets- i say if you are planning to get these they can definitely be shared!
178,18,GRECO,5 star rating,7/5/2021,"This place is perfect I love it

It's quick, simple, delicious, affordable, and fun! 

I came here tonight for a quick and tasty dinner and that's exactly what I got! I ordered the Gyro and the spinach and feta appetizer. Both came our insanely quick and insanely delicious!! Also I must say, the people who worked there are a vibe  i love them 

The outdoor seating is so cute. I'm definitely coming back!"
179,19,GRECO,5 star rating,6/12/2021,"This place is amazing because of how incredible the food and service are - the latter (delivered by Jordan) is authentic & superb and truly in a league of its own. If that's something you care about, you'll emerge from this restaurant feeling great!

Jordan is the most caring and dedicated retail professional I've ever met at any establishment anywhere. I have never met anyone in my life who's bent over backwards for a complete stranger the way he did. Jordan was passionate about explaining the menu and importantly, meticulously identifying foods that I wouldn't develop a severe allergic reaction to (for which I have many) and he cared about this even more than I did! When I was only able to eat 25% of ingredients in the dish I ordered, he to my complete surprise offered a free side after I had already sat down because he felt bad I couldn't enjoy many of the foods. If this isn't redefining the very best of expectations, I don't know what is.

The amount of care and dedication Jordan showed is enough to keep me coming back even if the food at GreCo was the most disgusting in the world - that's just how pleasant and kind Jordan is, but the food here is incredible, varied, and differentiated! I will most definitely be coming back over and over again and hope you give it a try too."
180,20,GRECO,5 star rating,3/4/2022,"DELICIOUS, super cute inside. Efficient service, clean environment, cute seating. The perfect portion and not too expensive. Family owned as well. My new favorite place to eat in Newbury street."
181,21,GRECO,2 star rating,1/26/2022,"This was the only Greco location i've been too. The staff was great, but the food was not edible :/ I got the egg-lemon soup and the greco fries and my friend got the vegan pita wrap. We also had the iced cappuccino and frappe. Out of all of that, the only thing that we finished were the fries. Everything else we only took a couple bites/sips of and unfortunately it went to waste. I had been wanting to check out Greco for a while after following the IG page . The food simply did not taste good at all (except for the fries!) and the drinks tasted like straight black instant coffee."
182,22,GRECO,5 star rating,7/12/2021,"Quick, good, perfectly priced. This place hits all the right spots, and I 100% recommend coming here and getting a bite. The flavors were explosive with every bite. Portions were perfect, fills you up and keeps you satisfied. This place checks off every box for me, and I can't rave about them enough. Go try it out!"
183,23,GRECO,4 star rating,10/19/2021,Stopped here for lunch while on vacation in Boston. It's a cute little counter service spot serving Greek street food on Newbury Street - a great location if doing some shopping or sightseeing in the Back Bay. During prime lunch hours it was quite busy but we managed to snag a table outside. They also have a counter style seating and small tables indoors too. I got a build your own pita with chicken gyro and a side of Greco fries. The service here was excellent and very friendly. The food was delicious and satisfying. I could not get enough of the fries topped with feta. I asked for a side of tzatziki to dip them in and it was delightful. The chicken was kind of salty though and left me feeling bloated for most of the day. I liked having this option of delicious Greek food because most of the trip was very seafood/Italian based food. Definitely a good spot with fair prices to check out for a quick bite.
184,24,GRECO,5 star rating,3/18/2022,"The lamb chops were a special and they were crazy flavorful!! The zucchini chips were salty and flavorful, pita was soft and warm. Best meal I had in Boston in the 3 days I've been here. Would love to come again!"
185,25,GRECO,5 star rating,3/11/2021,"TLDR: bomb Greek food 

Came here for a late lunch and this place hit it out of the park. Prices are fair for a casual back bay location and the flavor is excellent. Big fan of the zucchini chips. I got the lamb plate which was filling and my wife got one of their geek salads which had an excellent tender piece of feta. And the latte was not overly sweet and packed with flavor. Would recommend."
186,26,GRECO,3 star rating,7/7/2021,"I am sad to give only 3 stars but the food was missing something. I had the lamb with greek grains. My husband greek dinner plate with pork, with spanakopita egg rolls which were the best part. Our meal did come with a wonderful show by the owner, Zoe. Zoe is awesome. I look forward to trying it again sometime."
187,27,GRECO,5 star rating,12/7/2020,Absolutely amazing! I ordered the lamb gyro with a side of tzatziki and everything was super flavourful and fresh. I love that it feels like an indulgent eat but it is balanced and doesn't leave you feeling groggy. The newbury street patio is very pleasant.
188,28,GRECO,5 star rating,9/6/2021,"Greco is a fast paced experience with quick ordering times and a short wait. There's seating inside and outside but the inside seating is a little bit cramped. The Classic Bifteki had a great char and the spicy feta added a nice tang. The fries also had a very smoky and savory taste. The veggie gyro had generous pieces of zucchini fritters. My friend Alison said that ""they have the opposite problem of other places, they've got too much filling and too little bread."" The pork was a little tougher than my friend expected it to be but it was still bearable and delicious. Our gyros were all stuffed very full and they were very filling. Get the loukamades, I think all the flavors were good, we especially enjoyed the crushed nuts."
189,29,GRECO,3 star rating,11/30/2020,"What is it with Boston and mediocre mediterranean? Literally every other place serves up the same compostable-bowl nonsense wrapped in a pita-shaped oil sponge.  Like, does Boston get a discount on sad chickpeas?

This is kind of unfair, GreCo is a nice spot with a nice little outdoor seating area (important for these insane times).  But the food is just eh.  It's Spyce, Dig Inn, Cava all over again.  I give them credit for not shoving everything into a bowl, but the taste is almost exactly the same.

There's a couple highlights: I thought their spicy feta dip was good, but it was also just a cup full of feta.  Not that I'm complaining.  I also liked their zucchini chips, but, you can't really go wrong with fried."
190,30,GRECO,4 star rating,7/3/2020,"I've heard a lot about this place so I knew I had to try it.

The food was pretty good, but I'm not sure if it lives up to the hype. I had the lamb gyro and it was about $11 after tax. Pretty expensive for a gyro, but it's Boston.

The gyro itself had a decent amount of lamb meat and the pita was nice and warm. I do wish it had more flavor though. The lamb could have been seasoned better. Also, the lamb had a lot of chewy fat pieces that I had to awkwardly, discreetly spit out while eating. If these two changes were made, I'd give a higher rating for sure. Still, a solid fresh and satisfying lunch."
191,31,GRECO,5 star rating,11/10/2020,"As I sat at a table outside on the windy evening and waited for my girlfriend, I decided to sneak a fry from the gyro. ""Damn that was good..."" I thought to myself. ""Please come faster so we can eat this!!""

If you want the best tastebud experience here, go for the gyros. All the ingredients are perfectly balanced and so yummy! The bifteki (beef) is great. For a guy like myself, they don't fill you all the way, so go for the salads or plates for a bigger portion.

At the moment, dining seems to be all outside but there are plenty of tables where you can usually find space for. Food comes pretty fast and there's also a water dispenser inside.

One of my favorite Boston spots!"
192,32,GRECO,5 star rating,7/13/2021,"Fast casual done RIGHT! Gyros were excellent and came out quick. The staff were funny and engaging and the outdoor, casual setting is great for an easy, inexpensive meal. 

Lamb was fantastic as were the spanakopita (am I spelling that right?). 

I am not sure if this place is looking to expand its beverage option, but I would love to see this place at least serve some Greek wine as IMO a glass of assyrtiko or athiri would have went great with the evening. But, for now, the sparkling water and non-alcoholic options are just fine."
193,33,GRECO,4 star rating,4/29/2021,"I tried this place for the first time yesterday and it was amazing! It's everything I thought it would be, the classic pork was so flavorful and tasty. As for the desserts, I had to try every one of them and they all were delicious. The only thing I would say is I wish there were more fries in the pita if I remember correctly there was so little fries and maybe more sauce but overall this place is worth it for sure!!"
194,34,GRECO,5 star rating,10/11/2020,"Service is very fast here! The servers are also friendly and willing to explain the menu (won't make fun of you for not being able to say the names of the dishes). They do social distance customers and have plenty of area to wait for your food. You can eat outside or take out your food. 

Classic Bifteki: The meat inside this was so flavorful and juicy, I was jealous I didn't order this meat myself. The feta cheese mix was great and not too spicy. 

Build your own: I chose the pita with pork and tzatziki sauce. The meat was a little dry but very flavorful. I loved the sauce and if you like cucumbers you should try this sauce. It was so refreshing and went well with all the other flavors. Just in case you aren't aware if you add onions they will be raw, same with the tomato. 

Greco Fries: MY FAVORITE FRIES! These were so flavorful and the feta on top made them great. The fries themselves were crispy and had seasoning but weren't too salty. The feta added to the top made it feel less greasy than just eating french fries. 100% will be ordering again! 

Yaya's: My favorite donuts! They are made fresh so eat them quickly after ordering or they will get soggy. The chocolate sauce is so delicious, I wish I could buy a bottle of it! I loved the texture that the oreo topping added to the donut bites. I will definitely order this again when I come back!

Kataifi: These were also very crisp and definitely made fresh! The sauce on top was a thick custard that was only slightly sweet so this is a great option if you don't like sweet desserts. I loved the pistachio pieces on top because of both the texture and flavor but it mostly tasted of custard."
195,35,GRECO,5 star rating,11/26/2019,"Holy Zucchini!! Have you ever tried something you never thought of trying... and at the same time blew your mind and made you start questioning your life decisions? These zucchini fries did it for me. Oh my Buddha. Shemomechama.

Lately I have been obsessed with Greek culture- the people, the food, the atmosphere- which brought me here. "
196,36,GRECO,5 star rating,11/14/2020,"Don't have anything to add that hasn't been said already, but this place is a must try if you're living in the Boston area. I strongly recommend the veggie classic, but add spicy feta - delicious. My meat-loving friend had the bifteki, which he said was the softest beef he'd ever had, but after trying my gyro he actually decided he'd just stick with the veggie next time! We also tried the lamb classic, which was very good; the fries, which were a solid pick but definitely get a sauce to go with them; and the butternut squash soup, which was also amazing.

Lastly and maybe most importantly: the loukomas are divine. The blueberry lemon is my all time favorite but I always have trouble picking. Don't worry though - you're guaranteed to love them no matter which flavor you get."
197,37,GRECO,4 star rating,1/4/2020,"A bright little restaurant on a lower level of a building on Newbury street awaits you. The interior is simple, bright and amazing how efficient they are with the space. 

Ordered the chicken plate dinner. It comes with a side, choice of meat and sauce. The chicken was soft and juicy and delicious, the vulgar side was amazing as I have never had one that was so tasty and filled of great flavor. Loved the Tzatziki sauce with it and the combination was great.

So glad that I got to try this little gem, the staff made the experience even more pleasant. Loved it and highly recommend it!!"
198,38,GRECO,5 star rating,7/26/2019,"My boyfriend and I came here last weekend when it felt like 106 degrees outside. We got a Chicken Gyro Pork Gyro and a side of Fries. Everything tasted delicious! The Gyros were so neatly filled and wrapped. The people were pretty nice. They do have a single bathroom which was nice. Minimal seating with a cute atmosphere that reminded me of being in a stereotypical Greek woman's kitchen.

I don't come to Newbury Street often and I've have GreCo on my Bookmark list for ages. I'm so glad I was finally able to come. Everything we had so amazing and I look forward to coming back here one I'm in the area next time...preferably when it's not 96+ degree weather!"

201,41,GRECO,5 star rating,7/10/2019,"Wow.

Wow.

Oh.... and wow.

Despite the ton of restaurants in the Back Bay where I live, I have to admit there are very few that are ""amazeballs"" in my book. Yes, we have some good places with an occasional great dish, but few that are just across-the-top great. GreCo, one of the new kids on the block (literally, not the boy band, idiot), is one of the few great ones.

I came here for lunch yesterday, after hearing my sister and brother-in-law singing praises about this place. I ordered the Horiatiki salad (tomato, cucumber, onion, kalamata olives, oregano, feta ) for myself and friend. For the kids, I ordered the lamb and pork plates with Tzatziki sauces, one with GreCo fries (with feta and oregano), the other with fried zucchini chips (OMG.....!!). Because of a nut allergy in the family, I ordered the only non-nut donut, the Bougatsa. I love that they also have authentic Greek beverages, as well as canned/bottled drinks, including this amazing rose-water lemonade.

This is honestly one of the BEST Greek eateries I've ever been to nationwide. Period. The meats are amazing. Sauces fantastic. Authenticity, on point. Service, friendly AF. Oh, and value for money? ON POINT!

So good was this place, that I came back for dinner..... AND I'M ON A DIET!!! Well.... I used to be.... apparently :)

Definitely one of my top recommendations for Boston. It's a full 5-star MUST-TRY."
202,42,GRECO,5 star rating,10/12/2021,"Greco is a fast-casual spot on Newbury Street that should not be missed. I'm a big fan of Greek food, but especially so for Greek food done right. Greco is delicious, authentic, and has so many good items on the menu you cannot go wrong. Their gyros have fries in them, which is so hard to find in the US but is the standard in Greece. The horiatiki (village salad) is a tomato salad without the greens base, again just like in Greece. This sweet find has massive portions that will keep you full, but try to save room for the loukoumadies (greek donuts) if you can!"
203,43,GRECO,5 star rating,11/11/2019,"This place is AUTHENTIC!! Run don't walk to get yourself a gyro from here! 

The flavor brought me right back to Chios island where I spent this past summer. It was incredible taste. Even the drink options: bottled water from Greece not Poland spring. If you're feeling creative I would recommend the Mastiha sparking water, it is a chios island staple drink. I couldn't believe they had it here, made me so happy to see. 

Vegan and vegetarian options, this place could not have been more up my alley. The zucchini cakes in the veggie gyro are sooo flavorful and authentic I could cry. Seriously so delicious. I would come here for lunch and dinner sooo much if I lived in the area. 

Table seats are limited but turnover is pretty quick. They have seating outside as well and even in the cold people were eating outside. The food is that good."
204,44,GRECO,5 star rating,6/11/2021,"Super yummy! We came during a heat wave and it was a bit too warm inside, but the food is great and they had some vegetarian options that were delicious. My favorite sauce was the spicy feta- everyone loved it after one bite. It was perfect for a quick lunch stop and would definitely eat again."
205,45,GRECO,4 star rating,7/31/2021,"We got the custom plate w/ pork, gyro and the santorini salad w/ lamb. This is a cozy little place w/ a fun menu. Unfortunately, I found the lamb to be way under-seasoned, somewhat gamey and pretty dry. I'm looking forward to trying the chicken next. I also tried the spicy feta sauce and it was good. My husband tried the loukaniko (pork & leek sausage) and he said that he has had better. He gave it 3.5/5. All that aside, they are pretty generous with the serving size and the prices are pretty decent for what you get. 

Home fries are delicious and I'd highly recommend wrapping up your meal with some of the classic doughnuts. 

Forgot to take pics!! :( next time!"
206,46,GRECO,4 star rating,1/24/2021,"Great place for Greek food! I ordered the Pork Gyro and Yaya's. The fries add a nice lemon flavor to the gyro along with the tzatziki sauce and fluffy pita! The donuts were also so yummy and sweet. Overall the food was fresh and good quality. Only downside is that it's a bit pricey, but still better than other places in Seaport."
207,47,GRECO,5 star rating,8/22/2019,"I was just strolling on Newbury Street and wanted a little snack and saw this place. I was debating between going back to a place that I've had before or trying something new and I went with a new place and it was well worth. I split the pork gyro and GreCo fries with my partner and it was the perfect amount of food to fill us up but not make us feel like a gross full. It was fresh and filling. 

Still thinking about my meal now and can't wait to go back."
208,48,GRECO,5 star rating,8/21/2019,"I got:
- Classic Pork Gyro ($9.50)
- Classic Loukoumas ($5.00)

Im so happy to find a place in newbury with great aesthetics and great food without it being overpriced!

I really liked the gyro but it could be a little oily. I combatted the greasiness with the hot sauce (shown on the photo). The hot sauce was on few tables so I'm sure if you cant find it, just ask! I also really liked the crunchiness of the fries in the gyro. But the real hype is the Loukoumas, aka greek donuts. It was my first time trying it but its freshly fried dough with honey and nuts sprinkled. I do not have a sweet tooth but this was actually so good. The aftertaste was SO clean. Even if you are not a gyro fan, you need to come here for the Loukoumas. The portions pretty big too!"
209,49,GRECO,4 star rating,7/18/2019,"My favorite gyro in the city! You really get a bang for your buck. The gyros always come out fresh, hot, and juicy. If you go, the zucchini chips are an absolute must! So crispy but still have enough zucchini to know you're not just eating batter.

Seating can get a little tough as they have such a small space, but great to grab and go in the warmer weather."
210,50,GRECO,4 star rating,6/19/2019,"A casual Greek eatery to get your gyro and pita bowl fix. 

Ordered an original pork gyro for pick up and it was ready by the time I arrived. 

I thought the gyro was pretty good, however I kind of felt like the french fries could be taken out and set aside as opposed to eating it inside the gyro. They didn't add to much to the gyro other than giving you a feeling of eating too many carbs. Once set aside, the gyro tasted a lot better! Wish the pork was seasoned a bit more and I really wished I ordered a side of fries - it looked super good. Will have to come back to try them!"
211,51,GRECO,4 star rating,4/15/2019,"Came here on a whim with my sister after dinner. I've heard about and seen photos of their loukoumades. We shared the Hellas Yeah, and wow! Super fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced. Definitely get it to share. 

With all its high-end shops and fine dining restaurants, Newbury Street can easily come off as an flashy and overpriced tourist trap. Not this place! Definitely coming back to try their regular food, and of course...for more loukoumades!"
212,52,GRECO,5 star rating,1/10/2019,"What an AmAzIng spot on Newbury!!!  Definitely a must try and my new go-to!  I love Greek food and here I have found an authentic, affordable and absolutely delicious spot to get it. Might I add, they have a beautifully done interior, which I love in a place. The interior and ambience match the great food. Well, the food was actually outstanding. I came in on a weekday around 5ish. The staff was incredibly friendly and walked me through the menu as I didn't quite know what I wanted. This menu allows you to ""build your own"" starting with a salad or pita etc.. I love having options :)

I got the vegetarian option which included zucchini fritters. A traditional Greek salad is the chopped tomatoes, chopped red onion, sliced cukes, olive oil, S&P, and Kalimantan olives. It was spot on and the topped fritters were lightly battered on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. Definitely a healthy option!  
I also got the zucchini fries with tzatziki sauce. Best tzatziki I've had. 
For dessert, my friend got the Loukoumades, which I tried. It's fried dough with sweet options on top. WOW!  I tried the Yaya's with Oreo. So deliciously sweet and again, not too fried. Batter was light and sweet and a tiny bit crisp. 
All of the above, food, restaurant ambience, service, and price (under $20!) was awesome. 
AgAin... AmAzIng!"
213,53,GRECO,5 star rating,4/3/2021,I absolutely love Greco And have been going to both locations since they opened ( back bay and seaport ) . Even now will drive out of my way and look for parking uhhh  ! Delicious and fresh and highly recommend
214,54,GRECO,1 star rating,6/8/2021,Their vegan fritters are burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. Not good at all. Would not recommend.
215,55,GRECO,4 star rating,3/11/2020,"Quick, easy, healthy, convenient, and delicious quick service food in the heart of Newburry Street!  PSA- this restaurant is very very tiny with very very limited seating.  I don't recommend coming here with more than two people, more of a ""to-go"" restaurant.  However, during the Summer, I imagine more seating will open up on their outside patio.

I ordered the  bowl with french fries, pita, and spicy feta sauce!  It's a good sized portion at a decent cost.  The spicy feta was good, however next time I will go with the tzatziki... I was looking for something more creamy!  The french fries were my favorite part of the meal!  They were sprinkled with Mediterranean seasoning and cheese, delicious!

I will be coming back here!  The service and food were great!  Looking to try a gyro next time."
216,56,GRECO,5 star rating,5/7/2021,So tasty. A great find with some outdoor seating. Quick service considering the number of people visiting. Loved it!
217,57,GRECO,4 star rating,11/8/2018,"Charming Greek sandwich spot in Backbay!  Decent food at a reasonable price.

+.   Ambiance is trendy, charming and intimate fast casual resto.  This place reminded me of a Georgetown row houses.  The resto is below grade / basement of an old house and has a small sidewalk patio.   We were a group of 10 and had to put 3 tables together outside.  When it began raining, their inside was very cramped.  This is a good takeout place. 

+.   Food is Kabobs in pita, salads and soups.  Their portions are decent. We had pretty much everything on the menu and they were all pretty good.

I recommend getting the pita since it's convenient and nicely wrapped if you're on the go. 

I've only had the chicken and I think it was juicy and well seasoned! And I absolutely love the fact there's french fries in it as well. 

All of the ingredients - chicken gyro, sauce, tomatoes, onion, and fries are well distributed so you get the perfect bite every time!

And if you want dessert, the loukoumas are a tasty treat, but make sure to eat them with a fork or you'll get your hands very sticky"

-Loukoumades!
-Cool vibe

-Wish they had nutrition info available!

Build Your Own Pita ($9.10)
Chicken/tomato/onion pita sans fries + sauce. The pita was soft and only a little chewy and the chicken was tender. No spice or anything to it. Nothing standout, but a a satisfying meal. It was a little too small too eat half of and take half to go, so I opted for eating it all and being slightly too full after. 

Classic Loukoumades ($5.35)
Greek-style fried dough balls (it comes with 7) topped with honey, walnuts, and cinnamon. They're served fresh and hot, but I found them to be better when I took the leftovers home and put them in the fridge because they felt less heavy that way. The outside has a bit of a crisp/chew and the inside is soft and fluffy. The texture was very reminiscent of sweet rice donuts except less chewy. I think honey was the ideal topping and added just the right amount of sweetness, but they offer many other topping options (including Greek hazelnut spread + Oreo) and you can even build your own."
221,61,GRECO,5 star rating,3/6/2020,"Omg I never knew pita could taste so good. Wowwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeee! 

Lots of sauce and tomato which usually lacks in a gyro in my opinion. The pork was crispy and fatty with just the right texture. Pita was hot and thick. I'd go there every day for lunch if I could."
222,62,GRECO,4 star rating,6/22/2020,This is definitely the lunch spot on Newbury. Great upgrade from the Chipotle lifestyle back in DC. The interior is quite clean and minimalist. Love the white toned colors and the bright mood inside. The staff is super friendly and quick on service. Been coming here recently and tried the plate with beef and lamb with fries. The fries are absolutely delicious - crunchy and crisp. The pita bread comes on the side so if you're a carb hungry monster this is your calling. The protein was pretty standard - definitely had softer elsewhere but still a solid choice. The most reasonable priced lunch on the street.
223,63,GRECO,4 star rating,9/16/2020,"GreCo is probably one of the best places to get some Greek food! We got the pork classic that comes with pork gyro, tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, onions, and fries, beftiki classic that comes with ground beef, spicy feta, tomatoes, onions, and fries, they come in a pita wrap and it's the perfect portion!The Greek donuts are amazing! We tried the classic (Greek honey, walnuts, cinnamon) and the yaya's(hazelnut praline, Oreo, powdered sugar). If you have a sweet tooth, you'll definitely love the yaya's!We'll definitely be coming back here!"
224,64,GRECO,5 star rating,7/22/2020,"5 stars for great vegetarian and vegan options. The squash fritters and pea protein keftides are awesome! Hopefully demand is strong enough to continue serving them.

The food... it was just so good. I got the squash fritter gryo and ohhhhhh it was mouth-wateringly delectable. The fritter was so creamy on the inside, crispy and not too greasy on the outside. The fries in the gyro were the star of the show, and I thought immediately that next time I come by I have to get an order of just the fries.

The food was fast, fresh, and too good not to go back and have again. I will definitely go again. And again."
228,68,GRECO,5 star rating,10/22/2020,"Probably the most authentic Gyro in Boston, I've try many gyros from many so called Originals!!!

Hand cut potatoes not too oily or overcook but fried perfect with a hint of Feta and oregano.... Absolutely tasty"
229,69,GRECO,5 star rating,11/20/2019,"Ordered delivery from GreCo on a weeknight was not disappointed. They prepared everything so quickly and everything was warm and at my door within 30 minutes. The build your own plate is the perfect size for dinner (or two lunches) and the pita/dip side was fantastic - we got the Greek fava dip which reminded me of an almost pumpkin-y spread and was delicious.

234,74,GRECO,5 star rating,9/26/2019,"Probably one of the best Greek eateries I've ever tried. I was staying near Copley Place so GreCo was easily walkable. Randomly found it on Yelp and I'm so glad I did. The food is simple, but very tasty. I decided to build my own salad, which came with one protein, one sauce, and some pita ($10.50). I chose the Mykonos salad with bifteki (ground beef) and tzaziki (cucumber yogurt sauce), and although it didn't seem like much, it was delicious. I highly recommend both the protein and the sauce. The balsamic dressing for the salad complemented everything perfectly as well. You can also build your own pita or plate if you don't want a salad.

It's small so there's not much seating, but it's fast dining. People tend to grab 'n go as well. Loved that it's on Newbury street so you can take a nice stroll after your meal."
235,75,GRECO,5 star rating,10/18/2019,"Literally my favorite spot for food. I've gone to the other location near seaport boulevard twice, but when I came here this one was closer and I didn't want to go much farther into the city and I wanted to check out the new location. 
First off, the decor in this place is so cool! I love it. It's a lot smaller than the other one but I like the style a lot better. 
When I went, it was pretty busy especially for the time! The line moved pretty fast though. It's not like the other Greco where it's like a subway style where they move you down the line. At this location, there is a guy at the register and you just tell him what you want and he puts it into the register (like regular businesses usually). The food is done in about like five minutes not even. 
The service is really good! Not really much to say about it but the food is just phenomenal. It blows me away every time. I get the pork gyro which comes with fries inside!! It also comes with tomatoes, onions, tzatziki and I'm not sure on anything else. The pork is my favorite. I've also tried the chicken which is pretty good too!

I wish they had locations closer to me, but it's so worth the hour drive if you have a free day!"
236,76,GRECO,3 star rating,8/1/2021,"We always ordered Greco via delivery. Unfortunately, the food has been inconsistent in terms of portions and quality. For example, the tatziki in the pork gyro today was much more liquid and runny than prior times."
237,77,GRECO,4 star rating,10/14/2019,"Yummy yummy! The gyros here are delicious but a bit expensive for the portion size. Two gyros run you about 21 dollars. 
I got the classic chicken and my husband got the classic pork and both were very tasty. It was a bit crowded when we went (Monday around 1pm) and the seating options are limited, especially if the weather isn't nice. The line goes very quickly though so we didn't wait long to order or get our food.
The restaurant is small and I wouldn't recommend for a big group if you are looking to sit and eat. It is very much a fast casual Greek place if you are looking for a quick lunch that doesn't feel like you are overdoing it."
238,78,GRECO,4 star rating,5/15/2019,"Came here for dinner on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed! The interiors are a bit tightly packed but modern. There was a bit of a wait to place an order on a weekday night. I asked the lady taking orders whether the chicken had garlic or onion, and she was very helpful and accommodating about making substitutions. I got the Mykonos salad with lemon yogurt and chicken and a side of zucchini chips as per her recommendation. The salad was fresh, flavorful, and filling. I loved the scoop of creamy lemon yogurt, and the chicken was flavorful and tender, and there was a lot of it. I didn't have room for the zucchini chips until later, when they had gotten a bit cold, but they were still pretty good, albeit a bit greasy. Would recommend trying this place out!"
239,79,GRECO,5 star rating,6/22/2019,"Haven't been out on Newbury Street in a while and didn't know this place existed until a few days ago when I saw it on Yelp.

It's downstairs pretty close to Zara right amongst all of the shops, and is a small fast casual sort of place. Vibe reminds me of a Shake Shack for gyros.

In any case the food was really delicious and surely hit the spot! The Pork Gyro was delicious and had the classic accoutrements like tomatoes, tzatziki and onions, while the Chicken Gyro had the same but with honey mustard sauce. They were just the right amount for dinner with a side of fries to share for two.

The shop wasn't that busy and there was plenty of seating, although it is mostly communal tables and bars. They do have a small patio up top that is nice too. Cute decor in the shop with little Greek motifs!

This place was perfect for a quick, not too expensive, tasty meal."
240,80,GRECO,4 star rating,3/25/2018,"BEAUTIFUL decor and layout at Gre.Co. They did a lot for such a tiny space. I felt like I was on Apartment Therapy- tiny spaces edition! 

The menu prices were affordable, especially for Newbury Street. I was pleased. However, I ordered terribly. I should have ordered the lamb jam gyro (which my husband ordered) but ordered a plate instead. I got chicken, spicy feta, pita, and zucchini chips. I was desperate to try those zucchini chips. I also ordered Yaya's Loukoumades for dessert. 

The chicken was good but not as great as the lamb. The spicy feta with the chicken was a salt bomb but the zucchini chips were everything and what saved me in the end. Yaya's oreo and hazelnut sauced crisp but soft donuts made me swoon!! What a treat- so delicious. 

I would definitely come back here for a quick dinner or lunch to go. The portions and affordable prices matched perfectly for me. This spot gets very busy so it is hard to nab a spot to sit inside but nice because there is outside seating as well!"
241,81,GRECO,5 star rating,8/29/2019,"I was looking for a casual lunch to take on the go and found this place on yelp. I love Mediterranean food so decided to give it a shot and I'm glad I did! The guy at the register was helpful in explaining the menu. Since I wasn't starving, I opted for a chicken pita with tzatziki sauce. It was warm, flavorful, and delicious. It was also the perfect portion for lunch and didn't leave me in a food coma. If I'm back in the area, I'll be back!"
242,82,GRECO,4 star rating,2/19/2018,"Gre.Co for lunch on a Monday and it was great. We both got gyros, which are probably close to Greek style but they're different. I got mine with a red sauce and lamb. The lamb was tender and juicy, the gyro had enough onion in it plus a smattering of tasty salty fries. Delish.

Mom got the chicken gyro and enjoyed hers, also with fries but tzatziki sauce.

Gre.Co is a small joint, only a couple of two-top tables and a counter. A table outside would be nice on a nice day.

A pretty good sandwich for around $10."
243,83,GRECO,5 star rating,9/5/2020,Tried GreCo today for the first time. I have to say it is the best best gyro I have had in Boston! Perfect on the go lunch while on Newbury Street. Will definitely be back MANY times!
244,84,GRECO,3 star rating,5/31/2019,"Solid option for casual greek food on Newbury Street, but I felt like I was missing something from my gyro. I think it's because I usually have some sort of fries in my gyro, and the sauce wasn't particularly tasty. I do appreciate the decent portions, so this will be a good place to go whenever I'm in a pinch to get some comforting greek food; but it's not somewhere I'll be craving going forward. 

This is mainly a takeout place, although there are tables inside and outside to enjoy your gyro if you want to."
245,85,GRECO,5 star rating,12/11/2017,"That classic lamb gyro! So good! Great lunch spot; line moved quick and our order came up relatively soon.

My memories of this place are filled with one regret: that smell of those delicious fries with the tzatziki sauce that I didn't have! Yup, should have got the fries.

The lamb gyro was succulent and delicious. The meat is carved right off the skewer and the gyro was full of delicious tomato, onion and served on a delicious warm pita. There were some fries inside the pita, but it just wasn't the same as having my own side order.

Oh, that red paprika hot sauce? That was bomb. A little spicy, but so asdfsdf delightful. Go get it!"
246,86,GRECO,5 star rating,12/12/2017,"To me a good lunch hits three important criteria:
1. It's around the $10 mark.
2. It's quick to get.
3. It's painfully filling.

And Gre.Co hits all of that: the long line is misleading because of how efficiently they're actually turning over (accurate) orders, the gyros (for example) are all under a Hamilton and they're also the size of a Gaston's forearm.

What to expect? If you're getting a Gre.Co Classics then big, hearty, flavorful pitas overflowing with fresh tomatoes and onions, an abundance of thick hand-cut french fries, and - for me - positively enormous and delicious seasonal squash fritters that were cooked to perfection.

But the icing on the cake (and I would actually eat a cake that had this as the icing)? The spicy whipped feta. I will think about that spicy whipped feta in days and weeks and years to come when I'm choking down some miserable lunch option that would probably be improved with a big old smear of that stuff. I got a side of it, and it was absolutely the star of the show. It came in maybe a four ounce container and was thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick (like, get a knife, because this stuff isn't moving. ever.). I put it on my sandwich, I put it on fries (more like, I put my fries on it), I ate it with a spoon. It's cool, it's creamy, it's feta-y, it's got some sweet heat from peppers. It's perfection.

Lunch from here is a definite win."
247,87,GRECO,4 star rating,12/7/2017,"Beautifullly simple Greek fare with classic roots. A few extremely comfortable seats in the small space., but once you see the food presented, you'd have a hard time venturing far before diving in. 

I went classic pork gyro, which is a hearty portion of shaved pork gyros on a warm pita with tsatziki, tomatoes and onion. Bonus: nicely crisped fries in varying quantity (a lunching colleague snagged twice the volume in their wrap).

Beverages include imported cans and bottles, soft drinking anything from tea to lemon sodas. Refreshing!

The best value comes from the plate option: the most expensive at $11, but ample in serving size, and getting the zucchini chips as a side option is straight baller country. Get them. 

Huge fan of the paprika hot sauce scattered through the dining area. Meat's a little dry, but all in all, super flavorful and an easy lunch option in the area."
248,88,GRECO,5 star rating,4/4/2019,"Ummm, I love this place more than I thought I ever would. My first yummy encounter here was on a whim. My boyfriend and I were on a hunt for something relatively cheap [for the area], fast and within walking distance. Not only did this place meet all of those requirements, it exceeded any and all expectations! I've never been super impressed with food options on Newbury. Like nothing has ever tasted amazing or made me want more until GreCo!

Love love love this place!!!

All of the classics on the menu are superb. My faves are the classic veggie and the classic lamb. I also obsessed with the zucchini chips! The greek doughnuts are also amazing. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

This establishment has become a staple in my book. The staff is so friendly. The place is super cute and clean. I'm always happy after every inhalation of food from GreCo!"
249,89,GRECO,5 star rating,7/7/2021,"The pork gyro is really really good. Definitely the best gyro I've ever had. I went during lunch time and all the tables were occupied (it's a pretty small place), but it's definitely a great spot for takeout."
250,0,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/9/2022,"I had the distinct advantage of staying in a nearby hotel and got up early and walked around and then Yelped breakfast options. This original location was at the top of the list. They opened at 7:30 am so I had to return after that time (told you I got up early!).

This place had great breakfast sandwiches and as I waited for my order inside this tiny original location, I watched non-stop foot traffic coming and going with orders. It is a very popular place.

I had the Yelpers-recommended Breakfast Grilled Crack sandwich which has fried egg, two slices of bacon, and 4 cheeses! (American,  Cheddar, Swiss & Gruyere). All this served on a buttered Flourhouse Sourdough toasted bread. This sandwich can fill one up for 2 days and there's enough fat in it to keep a bear well hibernated for Winter. But, oh is it good! Freshly made by a jolly crew in a historic building adds to the flavor. 

Give this place a try when in the Theater District/Chinatown areas in Boston and you and your waistline will thank me later!"
251,1,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/8/2022,"If you haven't been to Mike and Patty's, you're missing out.  They have the best egg sandwiches in town.  Even the vegan sandwich is amazing.

Staff is always super friendly.  SMALL.  Be prepared to not be able to sit, so you will have to take your sandwich to go."
252,2,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,3/22/2022,"Delicious sandwiches, amazing staff. This place was near my Hotel in Boston, stopped by one morning and had to come back the next morning for another one. The staff even remembered me and gave me advice for my trip. I had the fancy and then the fancy with turkey and they were both spectacular. Honorary mention to their chamomile and lemon tea blend.

Side note: can be a little expensive for a student, traveler budget but I think it was worth it."
253,3,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,3/21/2022,"Get the Vegan Sandwich:) it's so unique and delicious. I love the corn English muffin that's on the outside and the inside has mushroom and melted cheese that together it's a great combo:) 

Cute place only allows two people to go in and pick up the food. 

4 star bc the coffee was definitely not good. Could do better if they had better coffee to go with the perfect breakfast sandwich. 

I also love the neighborhood it's in. Super cute and historic."
254,4,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,3/17/2022,Quick stop for a breakfast sandwich. I loved the English muffin. Wish there was a little more pizazz in flavor but overall it was really good.
255,5,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/31/2021,"Friend and I ordered the fancy and grilled crack. Both were simply delicious, but I liked the fancy more because it was lighter. Avocado worked well to balance the cheese/bacon and eggs. I usually don't like mayo, but something about their mayo just works, maybe it's not mayo. If you'd like a heart attack, definitely go for grilled crack. Both taste better with hot sauce!!
Store is super cute and on a picturesque street. Ordering is quite easy, but they get pretty busy, so expect a wait."
256,6,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,11/17/2021,"Yummm who's down for breakfast grilled cheese? Because that's what this place is all about. They're located in a tiny shop in a residential area. You'll find them because there is probably a line around the corner. 

You can order to go from an app... but they do a pretty good job of getting orders out quickly if you walk up and order. Only two people are allowed in the shop at a time, then you'll wait outside for them to call your name with your order.

I got the breakfast crack. It was bomb. Ill totally be coming back here."
257,7,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,11/10/2021,"We ordered the Breakfast Grilled Crack Sandwich and the Fancy Sandwich -- both so yummy and cheesy! 

There was a line outside when we arrived but the wait was not bad at all and the food came out within a couple minutes. Overall, really cute store,  friendly workers and delicious breakfast sandwiches!"
258,8,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/8/2022,I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The staff are incredibly friendly and the food is so good! Amazing value for the price! I got the grilled crack and added avocado and it was fantastic!! Can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu!

260,10,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,10/23/2021,"Omg!  The BEST breakfast sandwiches, hands down!  We saw this little shop on Tik Tok and had to go while we were in Boston!  You can order the sandwiches to-go or wait in line.  Trust me, it was definitely worth the wait!

We had the ""Fancy"" which was fried egg, bacon, avocado, and some sort of delicious spiced Mayo.  We also had the ""Grilled Crack"".  It was amazing!! Double bacon and triple cheese with egg, all on sourdough.  This one was my absolute fave!! They also have fresh squeezed juice to go!"
261,11,Mike & Patty's - Boston,3 star rating,4/10/2022,Ordered their food online so can't speak to the restaurant itself but the food was just average. We ordered breakfast sandwiches and they hardly had any egg and it was mostly just a grilled cheese. I would maybe suggest trying it in person for a better experience.
262,12,Mike & Patty's - Boston,2 star rating,9/12/2021,"Given the high reviews for Mike and Patty's, I was expecting to be blown away by the breakfast sandwiches with something unique or great, but felt let down with pretty standard breakfast sandwich fare.

Mike and Patty's is a tiny hole in the wall shop that cranks out take out breakfast orders that are taken either online or in-person.  Even getting there at an early hour, there was clearly a high demand for this popular breakfast spots food as the wait times were around twenty to thirty minutes from the time of ordering.  

Ordered the Torta and Grilled Crack which from Yelp were the most popular recommended items.  The torta had a nice runny egg with well cooked potatoes, but needed more salsa or beans to provide extra flavor.  The grilled crack was definitely the better sandwich with crisp bacon that served as the perfect contrast to the mix of melted cheeses.  Unfortunately, the sandwich did not feel worth the $10 as it was pretty small.

Parking is very limited here!  Better off walking over.

Overall, Mike and Patty's is a standard breakfast sandwich place that you can consider if you are in the area, but otherwise, it is okay if you have other places you would like to try in the Boston area."
263,13,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,9/20/2021,"Best breakfast sandwich in Boston. I dream about their sandwich: ""The Fancy."" It's literally gold: a perfect combination of fresh bread, fluffy eggs, crispy bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, and the house mayo that brings the whole sandwich together to EXPLODE inside your mouth. 

Definitely worth the $11 dollars per sandwich. Very filling, the best way to start your day."
264,14,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/23/2022,"You might miss it when you're walking through the cobblestone neighborhoods of Bay Village but Mike & Patty's is a MUST if you're looking for quality breakfast sandwiches containing ingredients from locally sourced farms and vendors!

My personal favorite is the Fancy! The Fancy is sure to satisfy that morning hunger with two perfectly fried eggs, crispy bacon pieces, melted cheddar cheese, red onions, and their amazing house-Mayo on toasted multigrain bread (oh and I can't forget the the avocado which is what makes this sandwich oh so fancy). 

Pop on over to the Church St location where you'll be in a quintessential Boston neighborhood! My boyfriend and I enjoyed our sandwiches in a cute little park nearby!"
265,15,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/30/2021,"The Fancy sandwich is so good! The fresh avocado is a must as it balances the saltiness from the bacon, cheese and egg so well. Love the multigrain bread too. A bit pricey for the size, but I'd happily go again."
266,16,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,8/25/2021,"I'm still dreaming about their breakfast sandwiches. The most glorious, cheesiest sandwiches I've had and I'm so jealous of the Boston locals who can get this every week. I think there's usually a long line out the door but we came at a good time with only 2 parties ahead of us. The shop is small but the workers are efficient with loads of eggs and bacon and bread on the grill. 

We ordered the Fancy and the Breakfast Grilled Crack to share and walked to the nearby park to enjoy. Wow, literally so good. Ugh I'm actually salivating thinking about it. Both sandwiches were delicious but I loved the Fancy just a tad bit more. The red onions really elevated the sandwich to the next level since the acidity and bite of the onions helped to cut the grease of all that cheese and bacon. 

I would make a stop here every time I'm in Boston hands down."
267,17,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,9/13/2021,"A bit on the heavy end for breakfast, but when you're coming in from out of town...this is the best way to start your day cause carbs don't count on vacation. A cute little shop in Bay Village. Eggs are cage free locally sourced ingredients. Shared half and half with my partner so i could taste everything. 

Must try the Fancy & Grilled Crack."
268,18,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/26/2021,"the best breakfast sandwich in boston.

269,19,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,1/14/2022,"Haven't ordered from here in a long time! But remembered the last time I ordered a breakfast sandwich it was phenomenal! So this morning while at work was hungry for a satisfying breakfast sandwich and ordered the Grilled Crack fried egg, 2x bacon, american, cheddar and gruyere
on buttered sourdough! So delicious omg they make a mean sandwich! And ordered the Baller acorn-fed Ibérico de Bellota bacon, fried egg and
Vermont cheddar aged 24 months on our house-
made english muffin! This is my new favorite breakfast sandwich so so goood!!!! Great spot glad I ordered again from Mikes & Patty's!"
270,20,Mike & Patty's - Boston,3 star rating,2/28/2022,"There were some very apparent pros and cons for Mike and Patty's. 

The pros: 1) amazing food. The sandwiches we got were some of the best breakfast sandwiches we've had in Boston. 2) great location in a cute neighborhood. 

The cons (which is what drops it down to three stars): 1) the service was not great. My friend has a few dietary restrictions and they didn't really work with us to customize a sandwich. She ultimately had to go to another place to get food. 2) wait-times were much longer than they suggested... 25 min wait vs 10 min estimate.

With those pros and cons in mind, I would recommend to anyone who isn't in a rush and has little to no dietary restrictions."
271,21,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,8/30/2021,"Visit: first (all the way from Miami)

Food: I had the Fancy w everything I did change the bread out for the english muffin (i do recommend if youre trying to have a ""smaller"" portion)
The bacon was to die for, THEIR mayo OMG sooo good and gives it a nice kick but not too much, the guac, egg and cheese was just perfect! 
My husband had the Robbie (used ham instead of bacon) he is so picky but legit almost ate the foil
This is very filling so def go hungry!
We had the coffee BUT be careful this is strong and legit I almost passed out lol so just be careful and stay hydrated 

Atmosphere: tiny hole in the wall but these are the best! 2 ppl in at a time due to covid, gets packed sooo def go early or atleast know what you want. They have no seating but its the cutest street so we loved eating standing up, than walked to the cutest benches

Staff: we were helped by Richie (tall, white fella who was awesome and even gave us stickers)

Will def return on our next Boston trip!"
272,22,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/8/2021,"After wondering about Mike & Patty's for quite awhile, I finally had the opportunity to stop by (note to self, as w/most busy places: stopping by on the weekdays is ideal). I tried the Crack, and it was delicious--hot off the grill, and very gooey with delicious cheeses and crispy bacon. As others have noticed, parking in the area is definitely tight, and I can imagine on weekends, this whole block must be packed. But if you're able to find a quiet moment and head over, it's well worth it. Hopefully I'll have the chance to be back soon and try some of the other options!"
273,23,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,5/23/2021,"This place is tucked away in a quiet corner. It's ALMOST hard to miss if not for the long line outside! Takeout/delivery only right now. I recommend ordering ahead of time though their website to avoid waiting in the line outside.

I tried the Jersey Shore $9 (sesame roll, fried egg, pork, american cheese, red onions, house mayo). A lot of the sandwiches on the menu have very similar components. It was delicious! The cheese melted nicely and I thought that they added an appropriate amount of red onions-- not too many, but enough to contribute to the flavor. The house mayo is a tiny tiny bit spicy and full of flavor. You can choose how your eggs are cooked. The bread was good but next time I want to try one of their grilled sandwiches.

Quite pricey for a breakfast sandwich of this size, but I could definitely see myself coming back. I can't think of another place in Boston that makes sandwiches as well as Mike & Patty's, where every part of the sandwich is done well!"
274,24,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,11/21/2021,"Food: 4/5. The sandwich is very tasty. I ordered the Fancy: Good freshly smashed avocado; 2 over easy eggs (you can choose how you want the egg done when ordering, highly recommend over easy because the yolk literally drips down the sandwich when you bite and that's the best). crispy bacon. and what add to the taste of the sandwich is the house mayo (it has an orange color, taste like a non-spicy spicy mayo used in spicy tuna roll; maybe something taste like a combination of thousand island salad dressing and mayo);
the house made english muffin is 5/5. $6 for a bag of four; very thick and fluffy english muffin; very buttery and give you a tang taste. They taste perfect freshly out of bag even without toasting! LOVE them!
However, other factors of the shop is not that great: 
Location: 2/5 (extremely difficult to find parking)
Indoor atmosphere: 1/5 (in door seats, this tiny shop literally only has a kitchen, you will have to order you food and wait outside; that's why try to order online beforehand; and knowing that the uber eats price is $2 than their online ordering portal price)
Price: 1/5. $10 for a very tiny sandwich that's literally your palm size. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich tasted good. so if you are in a rush in the morning, lives in the neighborhood, but still want to grab a good sandwich, def visit this shop!"
275,25,Mike & Patty's - Boston,1 star rating,7/27/2021,"Super rude service. As a vegetarian there's only 1 thing on the menu that I can eat (and it didn't sound very appealing, see picture). When I asked to replace bacon with avocado, they said said no - we can only remove the bacon but will charge you the same. They charge $2 for extra bacon, just in case you wonder..
In general they were not so yet nice and didn't even give me a second to order coffee. 
Ended up with a pretty mediocre overpriced Torta.
Will not be back :("
276,26,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/6/2022,I got the Fancy sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. The homemade mayo is slightly smokey and just perfect on the sandwich. 11/10 would recommend this place to anyone looking for a breakfast sandwich in Boston.

278,28,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/20/2022,"I am pretty sure they gave me the ring bread, and I am not a fan of rye. Despite that, it was incredible! I love their menu with options for all palates. The bread is baked to perfection. 
On busy days, highly recommend ordering ahead, as the wait can be long. I am not surprised because they quality of the sandwiches shows that they take their time making each order. Highly recommend."
279,29,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,1/31/2022,So delicious! We came on a Friday morning and only had to wait about 10 minutes for our order. I got the Fancy and it was so good. I definitely understand the hype fine this place.

282,32,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,3/14/2021,"People aren't kidding when they say this place has the best breakfast sandwiches! Mike and Patty's is located on the corner of a building in a super cute neighborhood between Back Bay and Chinatown. It's a 25 minute walk from my apartment so I decided to order ahead of time so that it would be ready. There were a few people standing outside waiting for their order so we jumped in line. It only too like 3 minutes. The inside is extremely small, so it's definitely a grab and go type place. 

We took our sandwiches to the commons and they were still nice and hot by the time we go there. I got the fancy sandwich but customized it. I got chorizo instead of bacon, and got over hard eggs instead of over easy. It was seriously SO good! Like I should have ordered two for myself. Now that I have finally tried this place, it will definitely become a weekend go to."
283,33,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,5/20/2021,"As soon as I arrived to Boston I found my way to Mike & Patty's. Very small place, everyone was doing pick up. 

I ordered the torta and the grapefruit juice. The customer service was great, the guys were working non stop. 

The torta was ok. I added chorizo to mine. The reason why I say it is ok is because I felt that the bread would shadow the flavor of the chorizo, egg, avocado and cheese. I'm that type of person that makes the bum skinnier when making a burger. I also eat my tacos with only one tortilla, two is too much. So, it is all based on my own preference. Next time I go I will ask them to give me white bread instead of the bum, hope that's a possibility. 

But besides that, they have been able to make a desirable combination of flavors in a torta. 

I would go back."

I am here after my second experience at Mike & Patty's to inform everyone that it is definitely 5-star worthy. Best breakfast sandwiches in Boston, prove me wrong. And yes, we were given many napkins this time. Either they were having an off day last time, or they took my review to heart. Regardless, a messy girl can appreciate."
286,36,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,9/25/2021,"The best sandwich at mike and patty's is the fancy, so if you are wondering what to get, get that! That being said, the breakfast sandwiches here are basically really good versions of what you can make at home. Regular sliced bread, egg and cheese, bacon and avocado, and pretty much anything else you can think of. They have potatoes, black beans, pico, just a few examples as add ons. It is really good but only 4 stars because it is nothing you can't make at home, and 9$ is a steep price for a bacon egg and cheese on toast."
287,37,Mike & Patty's - Boston,2 star rating,3/16/2022,"We went for breakfast our first morning in Boston. It quickly became apparent this is a tourist trap. While many people were there, no one was local. Also, there's no eating in and only 2 people can enter at a time. You have to wait outside for your order. Not knowing this, we ordered and trudged back to the hotel (thankfully it was really close) and ate in the hotel lobby. The breakfast sandwiches were ok....nothing to rave about. Everything has eggs and my son has an egg allergy so I was nervous even though they remembered to not out eggs on his sandwich.  All in all, it was food. The coffee was delicious though."
288,38,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,3/19/2022,Great little hole in the wall! Highly recommend ordering ahead since the line can get long. Sandwiches were perfectly cooked and just enough food where you don't feel uncomfortable after you eat.

The breakfast grilled crack sandwich changed me and I don't think any sandwich will ever compare. I did try their fancy sandwich.... but the former is so much better. The sandwich is cooked to perfection and is huge! I have a big appetite, but had to save the second half for later. Try to go at an off time (unless you don't mind waiting awhile) because there is usually a small crowd (mix of people waiting to order and people waiting on their order) outside the shop. There is not enough room to wait inside the store so they will open the door and call out names when your order is ready."

292,42,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,8/9/2021,"How good can a sandwich be? Freaking amazing at Mike & Patty's. If you're from out of town and had only 1 meal to have. Mike and Patty's is worth that much. It's definitely a must try restaurant in Boston.

We stopped by during a 13 state road trip along the east coast and this was easily in our top 5 favorite meals and we had a lot of meals at all the must try places. 

We ordered the Fancy and the grilled crack. There are no words in the English dictionary that could come close to describing how good these two sandwiches were. Simply put, if foodgasm was a thing, this would be it. 

I'm so jealous of the locals living here, this place would be a regular spot and worth driving and dealing with traffic for. Will be visiting again the next time I'm in Boston."
293,43,Mike & Patty's - Boston,2 star rating,9/23/2021,"Overrated. This place was a huge disappointment. It's like no one ate a good grilled cheese sandwich before reading the ratings. Tiny hole in the wall (size of a living room) with no place to sit or eat inside or out. Have to take it to go. Unfriendly and rushed service with no greetings and curt answers. I got the ""crack"" sandwich since that's the most popular one. What I got was super salty grilled cheese with overcooked egg (hard yolk) and wilted bacon. Bread was a standard piece of sliced bread and was burnt on one end. How does a sandwich place screw up a sandwich so badly?! Coffee was premade and mediocre. It was expensive for such a small sandwich too ~$10. The only positive was they got my order right."
294,44,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,7/24/2021,Our first visit to Boston; looking for local favorites to eat at. Got off trolly stop 13 and walked to this place because of the awesome reviews. We didn't realize it was take out only. The flavor is definitely worth the wait and eating on the curb. My granddaughter ordered the jersey shore; pork roll egg and cheese on a sesame bun. She loved it! They didn't have gluten -dairy free options so We are walking to the Boston Commons area so I can brunch at Cafe Bonjour. I did take a bite and it was scrumptious; brought me back to my years living on the jersey shore and this was my go to sandwich most days; very delicious
295,45,Mike & Patty's - Boston,3 star rating,7/23/2021,"My boyfriend has been dying to come here so we finally did. Around 10 AM the place was packed already. Everybody was so busy running around that it took a while to get seated. The waitress we had was very nice and despite being busy, she was still very attentive to us. The food was alright, I wasn't excited about it."
296,46,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,8/14/2021,"Really good breakfast sandwiches! Small shop at a corner and seems very popular. I got take out so the bread was a little soggy but the flavor was all there! If it wasn't on the more expensive side for a small to normal size, I would say it's worth it. It's definitely something you could make at home but if you're in the area, I would definitely pick up"
297,47,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,7/8/2021,"I got their fancy sandwich without bacon and it was SO GOOD! Look how the cheese melts and their sauce was delicious! I finished this in minutes!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! 

PRO TIP: Order online prior to going since during busy times the wait can take up to 30 minutes! I had to walk into the store to get updates on my order and he expedited my order."
298,48,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,6/27/2021,"Located in a small off main road street, Mike and Patty's is only for pickup. They serve some delicious breakfast sandwiches and wraps. We got the Fancy and Torta with chorizo. I got the fancy and it was perfect for me. Not too much bacon, avocado or egg and everything was perfectly portioned on multigrain toasted bread. My sister got the Torta and she enjoyed hers a lot too. Perfect portions yet again. So if you like over the top bacon, you can request more or maybe go for one of their other sandwiches, I think Grilled Crack had 2x bacon. 

We ordered online and picked up and it was ready to go when we got there. We did not order beverages there, but I was tempted to get their fresh squeezed grapefruit. 

I'd say there isn't much parking there, so order ahead so you can do a quick grab and dash."
299,49,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/2/2020,"This little gem for an amazing breakfast sandwich is off the beaten path for sure.  In between the Back Bay and Chinatown, I would recommend an Uber or Lyft there.

Anywho, talk about a Fantastic, FANTASTIC!! breakfast sandwich called ""Fancy.""  I was discouraged to go here because all the pictures all looked the same including mine, but let me tell you, there is a reason that everyone shares the same picture, is because this sandwich is SO, SO, good.  I'm not sure if they use magic dust in it or what, but take my word for it and make your way over to this TINY corner place to grab yourself a heck of a breakfast sandwich!"
300,50,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,12/6/2021,5 stars! It's got great reviews for a reason. Make sure to order the house mayo on whatever sandwich you order and the English muffins are so yum.
301,51,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,5/17/2021,"Definitely check this place out!

On that note, definitely place your order in advance online to avoid a lengthy wait. This place was packed outside with at least 20 people actively waiting for their food at any point in time whether for themselves or deliveries. My wife and I were looking to get our day started right and this place was close by so we figured we'd give it a go. This place is currently operating as takeout only, but don't let that dissuade you from giving it a try. I ordered the breakfast torta with chorizo and it was incredible. It has to be the top breakfast sandwich I've ever had. Each piece fit together perfectly and made it outstanding. Staff was very friendly as well. This place is a must visit if you are close by and haven't given it a try!"
302,52,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,5/2/2021,"Always a good sign when there's a long line for a restaurant. When in Boston, I found this place on yelp. Based on the outstanding reviews I was in the mood for something between breakfast and lunch. I settled on a sandwich called crack- which it most certainly is! The sourdough bread was toasted and buttery. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the bacon delicious. The restaurant has an excellent cadence  for serving guests  during Covid.  There was no seating inside so I sat on the sidewalk and enjoyed my delicious sandwich."
303,53,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,7/4/2021,"Yep 10/10 amazing. Super quaint little place in the middle of a gorgeous neighborhood! The food was excellent. Definitely comfort food. Food is made to order so it's nice and fresh. 

There's no seating, but there's a little community garden near by that is a wonderful spot to eat! 

We ordered the crack sandwich which was YUMMM! Some avocado with it would be so delish! Everyone that works there is sweet and helpful! We definitely will be back :)"
304,54,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,10/4/2021,"GREAT a breakfast sandwiches!! 
*order on line, and pick up! Super smooth transition and awesome food!!
Crack sandwich is AWESOME! Ate our sandwiches before I could get a picture!"
305,55,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,6/27/2021,"Long line this morning... but worth the wait. The kids devoured their Classics, the wife loved her Cracked, I had a Classic with grilled onions and potatoes today (it was delicious), and Avó had a Classic with grilled onion and avacado. It was Avó's firat time here and she was surprised how good the English muffin was. Remember to pre-order on their website before you arrive to speed up the process."
306,56,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/20/2021,"Holy deliciousness. The grilled crack sandwich.... perfect from top to bottom. With 3 cheeses (cheddar, gruyere and cheddar), egg and 2x bacon.... cannot go go wrong. The buttery sourdough just seals the deal. A light crispy crunch on the outside and then you bite into melty cheesy heaven. Unbelievable. A quaint little spot, so it is better to order ahead then grab it and go eat on a local bench or at the park. Super fast and pleasant service. Would 100% recommend, no questions asked!"
307,57,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/25/2022,Great food!!! I found a usual breakfast spot to go to :) was so full from the sandwich. Coming back again! Thank youu
308,58,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,10/5/2020,"A lot of options for breakfast sandwiches which was great because the hotel didn't offer breakfast.  Quick and easy to order off Yelp via Grub Hub.  

Maybe I'm picky about my breakfast sandwiches because it's usually what I order when I head to diners/greasy spoons - plus, I cook at home - but our sandwiches were greasy.  It'll hit the spot if you are hungover like I was (ha!) but might be too much if you're prone to heartburn which my husband was.  

Got the grilled crack and the breakfast burger.  Definitely add something fresh and acidity (tomatoes, pickles, etc.) to cut the grease and all the meats/cheeses.  

High scores for convenience (online order for pick-up) and location.  Though, the sandwiches might not be everyone's cup of tea."
309,59,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/25/2022,I have eaten there for 3 mornings in a row. Sooooooo good. Friendly service. Cutest neighborhood ever!
310,60,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,12/18/2021,Pretty good classic fried egg with cheese and sausage muffin.  The muffin is homemade and fresh.
311,61,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,9/7/2020,"I had heard great things about this spot. Amazingly, good breakfast sandwiches are hard to find ... even in cities. We were staying at The Fairmont Copley Plaza where the restaurant charged between $23-$28 for a simple breakfast item, like oatmeat, so we decided to venture out.

We called first to see about placing an order or if they were even open on a holiday. Nobody picked up the phone and there was no recorded message. Either they were incredibly busy, or closed. Neither being ideal as it was a 20 minute walk from The Fairmont. We went on their website and discovered an online order form. All I was craving was a breakfast burrito but sadly it showed up as 'out of stock'. It was a few sandwiches to choose from ... maybe because it was 10:30 a.m. on a Sunday.

I got ""the baller"" which comes on a homemade English muffin and the lady got ""the fancy"". Both were $9. When we got the bag, we remarked how small it looked for $20. We realize its a city ... but $20 for essentially 2 egg McMuffin-sized sandwiches with no sides was a bit disconcerting. When I unwrapped my hockey puck sized sandwich and it looked like a giant caterpillar stepped on between two English muffins ... I thought we made an epic mistake.

I am pleased to say that it was, in fact, one of the best tasting breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. Salty, cheesy, gooey ... everything a breakfast sandwich shoukd be. I'm not a huge eater portion-wise but I felt that I could have easily eaten 2 of these. One was just not incredibly filling ... although, as mentioned, the taste was fantastic. I don't know if it was the 'acorn-fed bacon' or the 'heirloom antique cheddar' or the 'local free range farm eggs' ... the dense salty homemade English muffin also probably had something to do with it. If it was 2 for $12 or something ... I'd have doubled up. But I couldn't bring myself to take down 2 of these on my own for $20 with tax. A McDonalds-sized hashbrown pattie would certainly have been a perfect accompaniment and made things a little more filling.

""The fancy"" was a bit bigger having 2 eggs vs. 1 and mayo and guacamole. The girl also liked the taste of everything but said the multigrain bread was too thick/big which took a bit away from the rest of the ingredients. She didn't love the taste of her sandwich the way I did but admitted to being a bit more full than I was after eating it. I don't know how they are regarding substitutions but next time, she mentioned an English muffin would have tickled her taste buds more than the bread.

If you get a sandwich here ... the melty cheese will be the star of the show. It's kind of the signature piece di resistance. Everything was cooked well and nothing was burned or raw ... if you like your yolk runny on your sandwich, you aren't going to find it here. The eggs are more well done and spongy with a firm yellow center ... at least ours were.

Summary ... quality ingredients, solid taste, a bit on the small-side. If you are a big eater, double up. The line was long and a bit confusing of a mele in the shop and on the sidewalk. It was almost actually more confusing to pick up an online order as you have to fight through a crowd who don't like feeling like you are cutting the line. Add pandemic into the equation. They do Grubhub though ... which might be our next move should we order again. If you are looking for quality and taste and are willing to pay a bit more for it, you will enjoy it here. The line outside the door echoes the popularity of this spot."
312,62,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,2/15/2021,"Mike & Patty's has the best breakfast sandwiches in Boston! There are so many options but one of my favorites is the Breakfast Grilled Crack with bacon, cheese, and a fried egg on Iggy's Sourdough. The Fancy is also just as good, the only difference is that it has avocado and onion!!

They've recently added a new option called the Sugar Daddy Burger which features double burger patties on a Kane's Donuts glazed donut. It is the best sweet and savory ""guilty pleasure"" type combo. It's only available on weekends so give it a try.

The store itself is very small, so make sure to order ahead for pick up."
313,63,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,7/25/2020,"The Breakfast Grilled Crack Sandwich is a Wicked Revolutionary!

My hotel closed their entire breakfast section? What's a nice southern gent to do? (Southern being south Brooklyn) Go to Mike & Patty's for breakfast!

I walked over, just a few blocks away to grab a B.E.C sandwich (A Bacon-Egg-Cheese) and head back to my hotel before hitting the road. Mike & Patty's isn't a large establishment, its a corner store in the middle of a residential neighborhood. There are at most, three stools to sit and enjoy your Mike & Patty's creation.

I'm reading the menu and The Breakfast Grilled Crack Sandwich is speaking to me. Let's start with the outlandish, there are 4 cheeses on this breakfast sandwich! American, cheddar, swiss and gruyere gets the party started. Then add some quality bacon, fried egg and all of this goodness is adorned by toasted buttered bread from Iggy's bakery. 

The sandwich is insane. The guys at Mike & Patty's made a homerun out of Fenway with this breakfast combination. Great job guys!

If your close to the area, consider a breakfast or lunch sandwich from Mike & Patty's. It's the best Boston has to offer."
314,64,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,9/26/2021,A delicious and quick spot for sandwiches in Boston. I love that you can smell them masking everything all the way down the street!

316,66,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,2/6/2022,"This is literally a hole in the wall place. It's in the middle of a neighborhood on a corner with one way streets. It's tiny, only two people can be indoors at a time and their menu is small. We ordered the baller sandwich and the breakfast grilled crack. We took our order to go as there isn't a place to sit and eat. They didn't take long to make our order, but I'd recommend calling ahead and placing your order for pick up. The baller sandwich was a fluffy English muffin and absolutely delicious, definitely my favorite out of the two."
317,67,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,10/25/2021,Delicious breakfast sandwiches and coffee! The house made Mayo makes the sandwich. I like how they have almond milk available to put in your coffee too. All the staff were so so kind! It put me in a great mood.
318,68,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,9/16/2021,"Can you crave a sandwich when the word ""Boston"" is mentioned in a sentence? Yes, if we're talking Mike & Patty's - the only place you'll pay $30+ for two sandwiches and a coffee and keep coming for roughly 10 years.

I love finding this place in Bay Village near my then boyfriend now husband's old apartment that used to crush his soul but from which he would emerge to devour a Mike & Patty's egg sandwich with avacado and bacon.

Not sure if the coffee refills are still free but we used to really appreciate that when we were insanely broke but showed up for a nutritional sandwich every now and again.

Great place that shows how unaffordable but tasty Boston is."
319,69,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,1/28/2022,"Absolutely hit the spot! We grabbed a bite to eat from Mike & Patty's as we arrived in Boston for a girls trip. Delicious, and perfect for sharing."

- staff was nice. You can order online or at the counter
- you can't sit down inside; it's just a counter to order
- waited about 20 mins on a Saturday at 10am which isn't that bad; consider ordering online for less wait time"

Just a wonderfully elevated twist that's definitely not needlessly posh. They have the right amount of class. The food is simply delicious and equally as visually pleasing.
The atmosphere is nothing short of beautiful. The Grilled Crack and Robbie were so good and really delicious.
The staff is friendly, personable, and helpful. Our server was better than most I've had and it was their first-day serving!
I will definitely be returning and look forward to it."
325,75,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,3/18/2022,Delicious! Worth the hype. Definitely take the time to try them out. We really loved their breakfast sandwiches
326,76,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,9/4/2021,Random walk by and saw a line stretched around the corner. It's obvious why! They are slinging only the freshest locally sourced ingredients and the bread is fresh & most certainly made local!

331,81,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,11/5/2020,"Stopped by Mike and Patty's for a quick breakfast it was incredible. Parking is not idea considering it's in back bay but we were able to find a place after circling a few times. The shop itself is tiny and right now they're only allowing a few people in at a time to maintain social distancing guidelines. Food came out quick and they also have an online ordering option available.

Breakfast Grilled Crack $9
Four cheeses, an egg, and lots of bacon on a Iggy's sourdough. All the flavors come together to form the perfect breakfast sandwich for a cheese lover like me. It was truly the perfect breakfast sandwich in my opinion.

Fancy $9 
This sandwich was a little lighter than the grilled crack because of the veggies on it but, still very filling and stacked high with ingredients! The eggs were nice and runny and the mayo brought everything together. Just great. 

Overall I can tell why Mike and Patty's is one of the best breakfast joints in Boston. Ingredients are fresh and prices are pretty good for the city. I can't wait to come back when I'm craving a good ol breakfast sandwich."
332,82,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,1/3/2022,"ordered ahead of time and strolled right in for the perfect hang over cures.  Delicious, fresh and well put together.  Highly recommend the bacon, egg and gruyere on rye toast.  Amazing"

The sandwich (the Fancy) was delicious and served quickly. I walked over to the park sat down and enjoyed (it's just a walk up spot, no dine in). 

Will definitely recommend and return next time I'm in Boston. Would like to try another sandwich as it was hard to make a decision."
335,85,Mike & Patty's - Boston,4 star rating,12/29/2021,"My fiancé and I get Mike & Patty's when we need some great comfort food! He gets the fancy and I get the crack sandwich. Both are absolutely delicious! the bacon is crispy, the cheese is melty and tasty and the bread is crisp. I wish the egg was a runnier, because it hides in the sandwich if it is not. I had to do a double take to make sure there was egg in it. the ONLY negative was the OJ - it was quite expensive and certainly didn't taste like fresh squeezed. And I went in to pick up the sandwiches and one of the workers bit my head off because I did not have a mask on. I felt really bad, I did not see the sign that we had to have one on, (I thought masks were optional in MA)  and I certainly will the next time we go. He was quite rude about it, but then again, I must of missed the sign stating it was a requirement. Definitely go! They sandwiches are great!"

339,89,Mike & Patty's - Boston,5 star rating,4/20/2021,"Amazing spot by Boston common! I got the breakfast crack today and it really hit the spot. It was a well executed synthesis of our all breakfast favorites: runny egg, savory bacon, gooey cheese, crisp toast. The sandwich also looks incredibly good. I really liked that the sandwich was a reasonable size so that I was left satiated but not immobile.  Lastly, the spot has a lot of character and they make the food fast. I highly recommend and look forward to trying their other stuff!"
340,0,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,4/5/2022,"DELICIOUS! The garlic chicken bowl was amazing! The grilled chicken, although pale, was not dry and had some flavor. The cucumbers and cabbage were fresh and crunchy. The crispy noodles added some texture. The tamago to me tasted a bit like mango so it had a sweet component to it to balance out the other flavors. I LOVED the creamy garlic sauce--it was both creamy and garlicky which made everything come together nicely with so many different flavors. I think the best decision was getting half spring greens and half rice as my base. I often find that bowls will have too much rice which throws off the ratios and I'm stuck eating just rice at the end but this was perfect. 

Also, the chopsticks here are legit, super good quality. They're almost as sturdy as drum sticks!"
341,1,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,3/16/2022,"I got take out of the poke here since I was craving poke so much! The poke here is definitely bombbb! You can mix and match but I got the Fenway bowl. The sauce brings it altogether, although I wish the size of the bowl were bigger. 

However, I got a takeout order on Yelp, and didn't receive soy sauce packets nor utensils or napkins."
342,2,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,11/27/2021,"I used to love Love Art Sushi - the food was great and they always pack the bowl with all the good stuff. The staff was friendly and very helpful during my past visits. I'm surprised I've never reviewed this place before but it was definitely a 5 star for me. 

However during my last visit, I was met with staff that didn't seem like they wanted to be there and my Fenway bowl was a little over half filled up which was a disappointment. It just didn't feel the same anymore. We went earlier this year and things were fine but I guess I went on a bad night this time around? I bumped it down a star from my recent experience but hope this was just a one time thing!"
343,3,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,4/8/2022,This place was great! The fish is very fresh and everything tasted good but the one thing I didn't like was the rice. It was kind of cold and tasteless. I still highly recommend this place though!
344,4,Love Art Sushi,2 star rating,3/16/2022,"Did a Build Your Own. Added Shoyu Tuna, Salmon, and Kani. The proteins were fresh . The white rice was cold, hard and lumpy. They were also very stingy when it came to the proteins. I asked for a little more because I thought that it definitely wasn't enough protein and they said they were gonna charge. I counted there were about 6 cubes of shoyu tuna and 8 pieces of salmon, It came out to be $19 for a Bowl."
345,5,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,3/17/2022,"Order the build your own poke bowl with rice and 2 proteins through grub hub. I like that there is so many options in add ons and they work well together combined with each item in the bowl. I took advantage of the max options I can pick.  Started off with sushi rice, spring greens and 2 proteins, spicy chili tuna and shoyu tuna.  I've gotten the regular tuna before and the color is neon pink, a little thrown off by this. For the add ons, I chose shitake mushrooms, mandarin oranges, grape tomatoes, red cabbage, and daikon.  The sauces I chose are spicy mayo, creamy garlic, and avo verde sauce.  At the end, to top it off, I got scallions, edamame, crispy noodles, bonito flakes, and soy sauce packet and wasabi packet.  They also have the option to torch the bowl at the end so you have that smoky flavor. I don't know anywhere else that does this but it's a nice touch and it does make a difference. So delicious, probably my favorite poke place in boston."
346,6,Love Art Sushi,2 star rating,9/15/2021,"Ordered a build your own bowl (which was great, it was fine) and a spicy hawaiian, which was a sad, half empty bowl. The fish + rice + veggies + toppings didn't even reach the top of the bowl. It was not worth $14+. The person who made my bowl was quite miserable, very unfriendly, and lacked basic manners. She was visibly annoyed when I asked for a second bowl. Love art sushi is usually one of my favorite spots but this time was not a good experience."
347,7,Love Art Sushi,2 star rating,1/20/2022,"I ordered from Love Art Sushi via UberEats. They were offering the special 2-0-2-2 New Year Bowl for BOGO free. The portion size was really small relative to poke bowls I've gotten elsewhere. I feel like they just cut the amount of fish in half. The salmon was pretty solid, but the tuna wasn't cut up in cubes like regular poke. Rather, it was a mushy consistency. The corn tasted like it could have been canned and the rice was a bit bland. The makiritto roll was also underwhelming - way too much rice relative to filling. Overall, not especially impressed."
348,8,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,11/11/2020,"Small poke spot a little off the main street. There are huge signs propped up though that should guide you to the shop. All servers are masked and the seating area is blocked off by huge tables, so you have to take your food to go or have it delivered. They're also collaborating with Okinawa Boba Co. (though I tried their boba before and didn't think it was particularly good). Their service is really fast. I was in and out in around 5 min, which was great. 

I got the Fenway Special ($12.75) and added masago ($1). They give plenty of each topping, giving half an avocado and lots of salmon and tuna for this dish. I personally thought the size of the bowl itself was a bit small given the price. 

In terms of drinks, they didn't have a lot of options at this location. They advertised Vietnamese coffee, which I was excited to get, but upon arrival, I realized their only drinks on tap were a taro tea, lychee cucumber and a red drink (not sure what it was)."
349,9,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,11/28/2021,"Changed my star rating to reflect the food solely after a manager addressed our concerns about poor customer service previously. They ended up speaking to the employees about the incident, offered to comp our meal, and assured us they would make sure that the experience isnt repeated and we were satisfied with their response. So, the food -- amazing bowls with fresh fish and our kids love the makrittos - an inexpensive way to feed kids and yourself! Four stars only because the rice was really cold and stuck together, seems like it wasn't that fresh. But the other location, near Fort Point, was better in a diff visit."

352,12,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/28/2020,Very smooth and timely delivery order. Boba was not spilled at all and presentation of the bowl held! At first I thought the bowl/drink were a bit on the smaller end for the price but it was very filling giving the rice base ($14 and $5 each). However it was super tasty and hit the spot! Seasoned very well! Only reason I don't come here more is cuz it breaks the bank but I miss the boba on tap from when we could go in person.
353,13,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,11/4/2020,"This is a cute poke bowl spot. Not too pricey at all. I usually get the Fenway special with eel sauce and spicy Mayo, I love getting my bowl torched as well. I paid about $14 for the bowl and it was packed with tuna, salmon, rice, corn, etc. it was a great amount of food. Parking is tough, there's resident parking only nearby and I don't recommend risking it because I got a pretty expensive ticket last time... the inside is nice and clean. The restaurant is taking the proper COVID precautions. There is no seating area, unfortunately but you could take your bowl to the park across the street. Overall, it was delicious and I highly recommend."
354,14,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,10/3/2021,"i saw ads about this place around the neighborhood and have always wanted to try their sushi bowls because they look so colorful! unfortunately, my expectations were not met when i came by today. 
-card only! they don't accept cash payments
-no place to eat inside the restaurant. however, there is a public area on the left of the restaurant with some outdoor tables set up. 
-the staff here seem quite friendly! there was no wait so they were able to make my bowl basically right away. 
-you can order for pickup/delivery through their website

-shoyu-ken bowl: this sushi bowl had white sushi rice, spring greens, two servings of shoyu ahi poke tuna, seaweed salad, edamame, scallions, nori furikake, and no sauce. the worker was kind enough to let me add pickled ginger on top and some eel sauce on the side for no extra charge. while i understand that sushi rice is not supposed to be temperature hot, i think that the coldness from the rice really threw me off. the sushi rice also didn't have enough of a vinegar flavor, and tasted quite plain. the veggies all seemed to be quite fresh, which i appreciated. however, they pretty much loaded up my bowl with veggies and not much fish. the tuna is supposedly marinated in a shoyu sauce. while it did seem to be fresh, it was still kind of lacking flavor. the eel sauce is really salty and savory, so i'm glad that i got it on the side. i also thought that they added too many scallions, which ended up overpowering everything else inside the bowl. my total came to $13.59 including tax, which is honestly quite expensive considering the fact that the bowl wasn't that filling. i probably should've added more to it, but then the price just would've been higher. (3/5)
 
overall, i appreciate the effort they put into making the sushi bowls' appearance. however, the taste could definitely be improved. i wouldn't consider this place necessarily affordable either, since their bowls are quite small too. i would recommend that you customize your bowl the way you want, so you know exactly what's inside."
355,15,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,5/25/2021,"Love Art Sushi has a quality poke bowl. I've had such a hard time around Boston finding a poke bowl that's fresh, a decent price, and a decent portion. This hit all three on the mark"

357,17,Love Art Sushi,1 star rating,12/1/2021,"Hugely disappointed in this Love Art Sushi. I showed up yesterday for dinner and was turned away. Why, you ask? Because they are OUT OF RICE. How the hell does a sushi/poke bowl place run out of rice? Fine, no big deal. I order online ahead of time today for dinner. 6:40pm, my pickup time rolls around, and I show up. NO FUCKING RICE AGAIN. Just shut the whole place down, honestly. If they cannot plan to still have the one main staple, that never expires, and that you buy by the fucking 50 pound bag, they have bigger problems as an enterprise. My order in advance money has not been refunded onto my account yet, and if it does not show up soon, I will be back to give the airheads that work here hell over my $17. Out of rice my ass"
358,18,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,4/22/2021,"such good poke, good service, no wait

i like to fill my bowls up alll the way and they did that no problem

i got almost everything there was offered and my proteins were 2 salmon and 1 rainbow salmon (flame seared) - such a good combo and good portions

the must have is the crispy noodles - it adds the crunch you desperately need 

make sure to get all the furikake seasonings because when i only got one, it wasn't as good 

also more must haves: kale, radish, edamame, corn

i got the avoverde sauce one time and the next time i mixed avoverde and gochujang (not a good choice do not do that) but the avoverde by itself was 10/10

the second time i went was slightly less enjoyable due to some hearing problems but it was not bad 

pictured is my first bowl - just the avoverde sauce"
359,19,Love Art Sushi,2 star rating,12/22/2019,"The restaurant is kept very clean with cute interior decor and plenty of seating. After hearing a lot of hype about this place I decided to try it out but was pretty disappointed. The employees were very friendly but gave off weird vibes and they didn't seem to know how to operate the assembly line system effectively.
For its price, this is the least food I've ever gotten at any poke place. You're barely given any rice. I will credit the fact that their fish is very fresh, but the scoops were also small.
They have a wide selection of sauces and you can even get your bowl torched.
They offer bottomless bubble tea drinks which is a good deal because it'll help fill you up. Their poke bowls are so small you'll likely still be hungry."
360,20,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,11/20/2020,"My go to order at Love Art is the Fenway special ($14), which has tuna, salmon, spicy mayo, unagi eel sauce. The portion sizes are good and always leaves you full. Sometimes its too much for me and I save it for the next meal.  The fish used isnt the freshest and if definitely tastes that way. They torch the fish for you which is nice. 

Overall, this is place is good but I wouldnt go out of my way to get it. Always a solid choice when you're in the area though."
361,21,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,5/1/2020,"Came here to try the new bubble tea line. The new favors were brown sugar, ube milk, Thai milk and matcha milk . We also grabbed the Fenway special and spicy Hawaiian. Staff was really friendly and helpful. The drinks were all Delicious. They came with matcha boba balls and brown sugar boba balls. My favorite definitely the ube milk. The Fenway Special was so spectacular. All the ingredients just went well together. The spicy mayo was definitely clutch on it. The spicy Hawaiian was a well balance of flavors and textures. It's a bit pricey but worth every penny for the quality. Definitely, will be back to get my poke bowl fix."

363,23,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,5/23/2019,"So, here I was reading about what ""real"" poke was... then thinking: if what I'm eating is delicious, does it really matter?

To be fair I wanted to give four stars, but considering I am starting to crave poke from here as I write is already a good indication. Sure, considering there could have been an extra scoop of fish for the price, but Love Art Sushi makes up for it with the drinks and service!

Ordered the Fenway poke bowl (no scallions) and it was a surprising delight! The fish was of high quality as the other ingredients. Bowl was of a good size but while I managed to spread the fish around fairly well, I found myself wishing for a little more. 

No complaints regarding the sauces, and I love the option to torch the bowl afterwards, though it didn't quite caramelize everything as it should have. A little too fast, perhaps? I will note, however: for those people who don't like a lot of sauce, make sure you ask for less.

The drinks were wonderful! Excellent variety, not overly sweet, and you are free to fill your cup as long as you are in the store. Have a wonderful opportunity to try the various kinds!

The service was extremely polite, offering me the various options to help add my personal touch, such as if I wanted sauces or the torching. 

The location was clean and had ample space.

Looking forward to returning soon and trying more poke goodness!"
364,24,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,5/18/2020,"The poke bowls are decent but their boba is...not so good. Their house curated bowls are priced very reasonably though so Love Art makes for an A-OK lunch!

Poke: 3.5/5  
Makirritos: 2.5/5
Boba/Bubble Tea: 1.5/5

I try my best to support local businesses during this time while also trying out new restaurants thus my discovery of Love Art Sushi. As an avid eater of all things poke and boba enthusiast, my goal is to try as many poke and boba places as possible. Love Art Sushi is a combination of the two so the excitement was real.

Okinawa Boba Co is the name of their limited time pop-up featuring 5 drinks: Ichigo Ruby Milk, Kinako Brown Sugar Milk, Cafe Matcha Milk, Amai Thai Milk, and Satoimo Ube Milk. The drinks are super beautiful and the aesthetics are on point for the most part. Warning: they don't have real boba AKA tapioca pearls, they use crystal boba which is not as great. The drinks definitely left me yearning for some chewy, sweet, tapioca pearls. All their drinks are basically a cup of whole milk with flavored syrup streaked down the side for looks. The ube was the only OK tasting one. The Thai tea was awful and tasted nothing like Thai tea to me. I appreciated that I could taste the matcha on the ""Matcha Milk"" but it seemed more like a poorly constructed matcha latte to me. The strawberry in the ""Ichigo Ruby"" was more on the tart side than sweet side so if you like your strawberry milk more tart then this is fine. The one I was most excited for was the brown sugar but it just lacked in all aspects. The brown sugar streaks on the side of the cup disappeared within a minute. I love brown sugar milk but this...wasn't it. I wanted to chalk it up to them having a bad day as it seemed like a high school kid was making my drinks. I wanted to try them so bad I bought all 5 but when 5/5 drinks are meh it's tough for me to say I'd go back for their boba. At least I got a cool picture out of it,

Their poke isn't my favorite but it's not too bad. The ingredients are fresh and the quality of the raw fish is pretty standard for poke. I opted for the Fenway Special because I felt building my own wasn't worth the value but my boyfriend opted to build his own bowl. My bowl was mostly pretty good but next time I would opt to build my own bowl so I can better control the sauces. The eel sauce kind of overpowered everything else. My boyfriend said ""I can't quite put my finger on it but I just feel like something is missing"" and that his bowl was a bit skimpy. Their kanikama or crab stick meat is a protein option when it should be a topping (it is imitation crab, afterall). Avocado is also a protein? Once again, should be a side. If they wanted to charge $1 extra for avocado being a side I wouldn't be mad but because it is considered a protein it's an extra $2. Seaweed salad and masago are an additional $1 each. This is why I opted for one of their house curated bowls. 

Their makirritos didn't present well. I expected cute mini sushi burritos but the presentation disappointed me. We opened them immediately after they were wrapped and they just looked all squished together. We came at 2pm to avoid the lunch rush but the guy making our food forgot the sauce on the side. We ordered 3 makirritos: salmon, spicy tuna, and shoyu tuna. We were wondering why they were so lacking in flavor...forgot the sauce, man. If I just had a bit of spicy mayo or yuzu aioli it probably would have changed my mind on these."
365,25,Love Art Sushi,1 star rating,3/1/2021,"I ordered ""Fenway Special"" and ""Spicy Hawaii "" in person in the store. The guy serving me was training the new staff during the process making my meals, which made ""Fast Food"" pretty Slow( 20 Minutes). 
What is worse is the quality of the Sushi, you can see the picture. It was bad and sour."
366,26,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,3/9/2020,"Hands down, the best bang for the buck poke I've had so far. Granted I had to walk a ways to get it, but it was completely worth it. I customized my bowl and the ingredients generously filled the bowl, to the point where everything was up against the lid. I've never had a portion of poke like this for the same price anywhere else, and this filled me up to over-satisfaction. The quality was spectacular too-- everything tasted so fresh.

I was so bedazzled by the food that I decided to buy a drink as well. That taro bubble tea was pretty good, on the sweeter side for my tongue. Unfortunately I didn't eat in to take advantage of the free refills, but NBD.

Truly a gem I'd return to when I'm back in the area again!"
367,27,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,2/1/2020,"Artsy sushi, study space, unlimited bubble tea?! So down to chill at this place!

I love that you can make your own poke bowl, but as a lazy person who loves anything in poke, I've ordered from their house curated bowls. Fenway Special and Rainbow Fish Bowls have been my personal favorites!

This place is an automatic study space for me with continuous flow of bubble tea (and also a bathroom from too much liquid). I usually could find a table to station myself at. I would recommend others for a place to eat, sip, and work!"
368,28,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,3/2/2019,"Love Art Sushi is a good option for a quick and reasonably healthy meal around the Fenway/Mass Ave area. You can pick one of the preset poke bowls (the Fenway seems to be the most popular) or you get to create your own.

I would recommend to make your own as you can have as many of regular/non-premium toppings as you like - my favorites are the shiitake mushroom, edamame, mandarin oranges, and nori (seaweed) flakes. For protein, I like their Salmon and Tuna, but thought the Unagi (Eel) tasted a little bit weird... I tend to avoid the Spicy Tuna and the Rainbow Salmon as I think the sauces mixed in with the fish can be overpowering, but they are popular choices among customers.

They offer a few different flavored milk tea and fruity tea available and you get free refills as long as you are in the restaurant! Definitely a bonus!"
369,29,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,6/1/2021,Great food and decently fast service for a busy and popular restaurant. Good food especially the mini Japanese burritos.
370,30,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,5/15/2019,"Today was my first time at Love Art Sushi. The poke spots I've been to in the past have been hit-or-miss so LAS was a pleasant surprise! They offer bowls (curated or build-your-own), ""Makirittos"", desserts, bottomless bubble tea and more! 

I ordered the California Dreamin' and my brother got the Fenway Special.  Each one came out to be around $13. While that's on the pricey side, I think it's justified. The fish and crab tasted high quality and the rice, toppings, and sauces were delicious. It was clear to me that each ingredient was prepared with care. I loved that they seared our bowls at the end with a blowtorch - an unexpected touch that brought the food to the next level. 

My only complaint is that the bottomless bubble tea is lacking variety. Plus, every time you go back for more, you have to repay for any toppings (bubbles, jelly, etc), which sort of defeats the purpose of having a ""bottomless"" offering. I would love to see a classic milk tea as an option, but that's just me."
371,31,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,9/8/2021,First time visiting Boston and this place just happened to be right where I parked my car. I love sushi so I have it a try. Employees were very nice and had Great energy even while having to make a huge order on Labor Day (not my order but I overheard them discussing it) Can't find makirittos back home so we'll definitely be back here! Perfect spot for lunch!
372,32,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,11/7/2018,"Love their poké bowls. 

So, you order at the counter. They have a variety of rolls and bowls (hey, that rhymes). Either you can pick one of their combos or build your own. I always get a build your own bowl because then I can choose all the toppings I want! 

I typically get rice as the base, lots of veggies (beets, carrots, bean sprouts, corn, tomatoes, etc.) The beets and carrots are pickled. I also add mandarins, because you get a burst of flavor whenever your bite contains one. Then two scoops of protein - their one scoop seems a little small. Either plain salmon or rainbow salmon which is just their marinated salmon (soy flavor with a few veggies). I've also tried their tofu, surprisingly tasty. Then you choose a sauce - I like the ponzu and the spicy mayo. You can get your bowl torched, if you like (so cool). And then come the toppings - edamame, crunchy noodles, etc. I also get their tasty seaweed salad which costs extra.

They also have bottomless drinks. The Vietnamese coffee is the best. I like their taro milk tea but they make it with a powder and if you wait a while to drink it, it separates. I usually bring my own mug. But the staff always gets confused if that's allowed. I mean it's bottomless drinks, so why not!

All in all, it's a great place to get a poké bowl. A few reviews have spoken about service being slow, but I personally have gotten fast and efficient service (in the evenings).

Other stuff - parking is tough to get in the area. There is street parking on Mass Ave but you might have to look for a while to get a spot. They have a few books and games in the store to keep you entertained. There's usually some nice artwork on the walls for sale."
373,33,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,2/27/2021,"It was mostly good. Three stars because they carelessly put together my order. I ordered a build your own bowl delivery for delivery. There were four items missing, including the ponzu, which was a huge bummer, and one extra item that I didn't order. The salmon, however, seemed fresh and they were generous with the other toppings. I always order tofu in my poke bowls too but this was the weirdest tofu I have ever seen. It was brown and slimy. It was also in long strips and not cubes like I expected. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be crispy and it sat too long but it was inedible. Definitely stay away from the tofu! I'll give them another try, they have potential."
374,34,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,11/12/2018,"It's definitely hard to find good poke in Boston and with going to Pokeworks and having a good experience there, I wanted to try Love Art Sushi.

Located on Mass Ave across the street from Berkeley School of Music, this counter service restaurant allows you to choose a bowl or a makiritto (sushi burrito). There are a selection of 12 or so items of bowls and burritos each, ranging from $9-13 (the burritos are around $9 with bowls ranging from 10-13 depending on the protein you decide to add. 

I ordered the Fenway Special which included: White Sushi Rice, Spring Greens, Corn Kernels, Avocado, Tuna, Salmon, Spicy Mayo, Unagi Sauce, Scallions, Katsuo Furikake (ingredients from their website). What's unique is that you can customize what you want as well as have the option to get it flame seared at the very end.

Overall love Art sushi didn't disappoint and I was satisfied with their food. However, I do have to say that Pokeworks gave more food and was a little cheaper than Love Art Sushi. I wouldn't mind coming back here but I would definitely try something else like their Makiburrito."
375,35,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,9/1/2019,"I've had Love Art Sushi bookmarked for longer than I can say, but finally got the chance to visit on a whim last Friday when I was in town for the Unofficial Yelp Event for Dine Out Boston at Davio's. Knowing I was in for an evening of good food and good times, I wanted something a bit lighter for lunch, and Love Art came through just in time! 

Tucked just steps away from the modern campus of Berklee College of Music, Love Art is a hipster enclave dedicated to Japanese-inspired poke bowls, ""Makirritos"" (a tongue in cheek riff on a burrito, with sushi ingredients instead of tortillas and beans), and bubble teas. The space is clean and well lit, with millennial friendly details like a quirky neon sign, funky avocado and sushi pillows, and plenty of seating for gossiping with pals or getting work done. I could absolutely see myself hunkering down to spend a couple hours here, and I plan to in the future! It's quite inviting, AND best of all, the tea fountain drinks have free refills! Amazing.

As for the food, Love Art follows the common fast-casual setup where customers walk down the counter and create their own bowls from a multitude of fillings, or place their order for a few house-made creations. I went with the create your own bowl, which comes in two sizes: a regular, and a mini snack one. The regular size was a filling serving for my lunch and I was quite happy with the portions. Each bowl starts with a base of sushi rice, and then you can pile on your choice of greens, veggies, raw fish, chicken, and more. I would have loved to see a bigger serving size for the sushi fish, as it was small, but I got a few different kinds to try. The spicy tuna was my favorite - I'll probably just go with a few scoops of that next time. My favorite part was the dipping sauces, though. I tried the Spicy Mayo, which was good but nothing to write home about. However, the Yuzu sauce was INCREDIBLE, and probably one of the best things I've had all year. The creamy lemony sauce was awesome on top of the sticky sushi rice, and I could not get enough! I'd go back for that sauce alone. Seriously, it's the must-get.

The Yelp Check In offer is so generous and not to be missed! For $5, you get a choice of a ""Makirrito"" and a fountain drink. We got the California Makirrito, which was basically an oversized California roll. It was yummy - I might try a more adventurous preparation next time, but I got it for my boyfriend, who isn't a sushi eater. I also LOVED the tea fountain, especially the sweet Taro Tea and the flavorful Passionfruit Tea. Add bubbles for an extra upcharge, which is totally worth it. A side note: none of the teas are unsweetened :( I was doing a #TreatYoSelf day, but normally I couldn't have the sweet teas, so if anyone from Love Art is reading this, it would be amazing if you could offer an unsweetened option or two! :)

Anywhoooo, Love Art is awesome, I can't recommend it more, and I am stoked to be back soon! #TeamYuzu"
376,36,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,1/14/2020,"I used to come here all the time when I worked at the Prudential. This location was never terribly busy (and I mean that in a good way). It was busy enough to know it's popular, but not busy to the point where the line is out the door and it takes forever to place your order. 

I found the portions to be pretty generous and the pricing is reasonable. The fish is fresh and the variety of toppings/sauces allows you to customize your bowl as much as you'd like. 

For protein, I loooove the poke options and the spicy tuna or even just the salmon. The sauces are all pretty solid - I'll change them up depending on the protein I get, but some top choices are the spicy mayo, ponzu, eel, and the avoverde. 

I'd highly recommend this place if you want a lunch or dinner option that is filling, but won't leave you feeling sluggish or sleepy."
377,37,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/24/2021,"We got the sushi burritos (makrittos) - in salmon, tuna, avocado. They come with sauce options on the side so you can get garlic sauce, spicy mayo, eel/unagi sauce. portion sizes are maybe around 2 to 3 bites so definitely would recommend ordering 2 per person as a good rule of thumb. We ordered for picked up and walked around the city while devouring them"
378,38,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/31/2021,Never disappoints!! Love this place. Particularly the rainbow salmon is amazing and full of flavor. Carrots are delicious. Always get your bowl flamed (best part)!
379,39,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,9/17/2018,"Came here at the suggestion of one of my friends, and I'm so glad I did! Great poke stop with fresh fish and great presentation. The concept is same as other poke restaurants you're probably used to -- chipotle style with fish as protein. 

The food: I ordered the build your own bowl with three proteins - rainbow salmon, shoyu ahi, and kimchi tuna. You can choose 2, 3, or 4 proteins. The rainbow salmon was mixed with corn and other veggies, pretty tasty. I personally didn't like the kimchi tuna because the spice personally didn't work well in the bowl for me with the other ingredients. But maybe if you're a kimchi fanatic, you might love it.

I appreciated the standard toppings were unlimited. Premium toppings were things like avovado and seaweed salad which was understandable. 

The presentation was fantastic. You have the option of doing a top sear with a blow torch. I'm not sure if it affected the taste, but was certainly a cool show. Then drizzle it with different sauces, sprinkles of sesame seed mix, add crunch with crispy noodles. 

The space: Medium size, some seatings that are bar stools along the wall or regular tables. Bright with nice decorations. 

The staff: Very friendly and patient, which I appreciate since it was my first time 

This place was pretty popular at lunchtime. Worth a visit if you're into poke!"
380,40,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,6/12/2019,"This place is a little hidden poke gem! It's tucked around the corner on Mass Ave and hence, is never too crowded. I've come here multiple times and the quality of the fish is always incredibly fresh, there is consistency (an underrated but imperative trait in these fast-casual places), friendly staff, and generous portions. They have pre-curated bowls or DIY--I always go with the latter but if you're someone who already suffers with decision fatigue, it's nice to have the other option. 

They have multiple protein options, lots of veggies (of which you can get unlimited, I loathe it a little bit when they limit you to only 5 or some other arbitrary number. ALL THE TOPPINGS!!!!). It's also good to note that seaweed salad and avocado are $1 extra, but I think this is standard practice now across the fast-casual-board. Lots of sauce choices--spicy mayo is my go-to. 

They offer cute and delicious drinks, with the options of boba/jelly in them; my favorite is the taro drink--yum! There's a decent amount of seating, I've never had an issue getting a table."

385,45,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,10/28/2019,"Fish is really fresh and they have a lot of options for BYO or premade bowls! 

I came in on a Monday night around 7pm and the place wasn't packed at all but they were backed up with Uber eats orders. There was about 6 people behind the tiny counter and they were all running into each other trying to complete orders that it clearly looked like there was no system going on. A person behind me in line even got their bowl before I did because of how unorganized they were in managing online vs in person orders. 

I got a BYO with greens and rice, cucumber, ginger, edamame, cabbage, seaweed salad, imitation crab, and two scoops of salmon with the ponzu and spicy mayo dressing. It looked like they didn't put much protein while they were scooping, but as I was eating I found that they actually gave a lot of protein! 

They also give bottomless bubble tea for $3 which is a pretty good deal. 

Overall, decent poke bowl but just wish service was a little more efficient."
386,46,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,5/31/2018,"Love Art Sushi is the closest poke bowl option near my apt so I've been going there a lot. The first couple of times I went with the fenway special. It's a good combo and comes with avocado! It's a little heavy on the sauce but overall it came together nicely. The fish scoops are pretty small in comparison to how much I usually get at poke works or yoki express. Also, masago is extra :(. 

Now I've started creating my own bowl and it's definitely too small to fill me up. It's too bad because they use fresh ingredients and I like their speciality bowls. Also, I tried the spicy tuna and it was basically fish mush. Maybe I was thinking of the tossed tuna chunks with spicy sauce at another place but it was NOT what I was expecting. I will never get it again. 

I guess I'll be trekking to the other poke spots so I can get some more fish!"
387,47,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,7/17/2018,"I really like the layout of this place. Most poké places have you start in the back, work your way to the front, and pay but not here! Instead of having to push through the restaurant, you can start ordering right where you enter. You can choose from one of their bowls or make your own. I decided to try the Spicy Hawaiian and my friend made her own. (she saved money so I'll consider making my own next time) 

For what the restaurant is, they have a good amount of seating areas. The food is pretty good and fresh. They have boba but I didn't get any. The atmosphere is pretty dope and overall pretty clean. 

Parking does kinda suck because of its location but a little walking in Back Bay doesn't hurt!"
388,48,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,6/20/2018,"I really enjoyed my Love Art Sushi experience. It is a short walk away from the Hynes T in a somewhat hidden street
I had a ""build your own"" poke bowl with two protein servings (poke and salmon and I  was surprised by the many toppings available. And the fact that you can add as many as you want!! I added mushrooms, edamame, cucumber, nori, rice crisps, mandarin orange and Spicy mayo (full disclosure, some toppings like avocado cost extra) . 

My favorite part was the BOTTOMLESS  bubble tea. Get one big serving of bubbles or jelly and then just refill your cup with any delicious flavor as many time as you want! I tried the mango star jelly with mango tea and the strawberry citron. Both were very good . I had a sample of the Vietnamese coffee tea and it was really good 

Can't wait to go back.

Update: so , I came back and got only one protein portion and it was tiny !! What happened??"
389,49,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,8/17/2018,"The food was bomb and the staff was so patient and helpful! Good experience, good food, good price point. Including the drink (free refills) I paid $13.50 total. You can order their special bowls or customize your own, and you can add miso soup. The menu can be kind of overwhelming at first, but you get the hang of it pretty quickly, and you order at the front of the store and then go in to sit down (unless you're taking it to go).

I ordered the 2-protein regular bowl and got: tuna, salmon, rice and spring mix base, bean sprouts, corn, cucumber, edamame, grape tomatoes, mandarin oranges, shiitake mushrooms, spicy mayo, unagi sauce. Almost all the toppings can be included in your customizations although some (e.g. avocado) are extra. I asked for it flame-broiled and topped it with sesame seeds and nori rice. Also your drink options are so good. You can opt to add bubbles but the drinks by themselves are refreshing and delicious. Writing this is making me crave it again. Full stars would go again"
390,50,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,2/28/2018,"I've been determined to try every Poke place in Boston and Greater Boston Areas. When I found out about this place, I finally made my way over there. It's definitely a bit tucked away, but it has a very cool decor / atmosphere. How to order is a bit confusing, especially if you don't know or never experienced ordering Poke before. All the staff was friendly and the gent who was doing the toppings was kind enough to let me know which Toppings were $1 extra.

I am very use to one price for a bowl, but here they do the bowl with the base as one charge (around $6 or so for a regular), then each scoop of protein (which are tiny scoops full) at a bit less than $2 each, then SOME of the toppings are up charges at $1 more like Masago and Seaweed Salad. I do secretly wish they had Crab Salad and Onions as ""toppings"". 

As I try the last two places I know about in the area, this place didn't impress me or disappoint me. They had different flavors of Protein which I found surprising and impressive. Their Shoyo Ahi was very spot on to Hawaiian's shoyo ahi (which I've had multiple times too). 

The sushi rice was a bit too sticky and made it a bit harder to eat in the recyclable ""paper"" bowl - Masago stuck all over the sides too. 

I'll come back here if I'm ever in the area again, but it was definitely an interesting experience."
391,51,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,8/16/2020,New favorite poke in Boston! My order came very quickly and the fish was fresh and cold. The portions were huge and the sauces were so good. I'll definitely be ordering again!
392,52,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/31/2019,"I used to be skeptical about poke because I thought it was just deconstructed sushi and obviously a fad. This place changed my mind and now I'm a poke addict. 

Their bowls are full of fresh, juicy cuts of fish. Their greens are crisp, clean and fresh. Their avocado doesn't have brown spots and is just the right ripeness. Everything is full of flavor, and there's a great variety of ingredients you can choose for your bowl. 

The place is clean and bright, and the staff are friendly. It's worth the cost!"
393,53,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,3/20/2019,"I was really excited to try Love Art Sushi - poke bowls have been a favorite of mine lately, and LAS didn't disappoint! I appreciated the amount of options I was able to choose from and the ability to further customize the pre-made bowls. 

I tried the Fenway bowl and it was really tasty, I just wish it was bigger for the price. Same with the makirito and bubble tea. Overall everything tasted good, but this is not a place I can frequent or I'll burn a hole in my wallet!

I ordered delivery so I wasn't able to take part in the 'bottomless bubble tea' that I've heard others rave about, but that's definitely an incentive to go to the location in person in the future.

Overall I did really like everything I got at LAS, and I would love to visit the actual store in person in the future, maybe after my next payday :)"
394,54,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,1/22/2019,If you love poke bowls... Then you need to come here for a quick bite of heaven. Ordered the Hawaiian and the Fenway. All the poke looked and tasted fresh and having the option to flame sear the sushi was a great perk (haven't seen that anywhere else in LA). The servers really were friendly and informative on how to make it taste so good. Definitely a must when in the area yearning for sushi!
395,55,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,11/24/2017,"I wanna like this place... but it just wasn't very good poke. My girlfriend and I came here for a stop while we were shopping. We selected a pre-made bowl of the Spicy Hawaiian. 

As much as I love the vibe of the store, the food itself was not on point. The rice was not very well prepared. It wasn't good quality rice. The fish itself was also very average and meh. I didn't think it was very well flavored or marinated. I don't like to think of myself as a picky eater and I don't like to bash on places, but the food here was very average. The whole bowl was close to $14 and I kind of wish we made our own bowl to eat instead.

Really cute place though."
396,56,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,1/27/2021,Love Art Sushi is simply great. The spot is very chic & clean. These guys got a spectacular menu too. The service is good from a welcoming staff. I wish I could give Love Art Sushi more stars.
397,57,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/10/2017,"Love this place! We purchased and used a Groupon on our first visit. 

As vegetarians, the toppings are limited to tofu and avocado. We did custom bowls with both salad and rice. By the end of the line, our bowls were filled. The only thing I wasn't super excited about were the sauces - especially the mayonnaise based ones. The drinks are sugary and I had to dilute it with water. The jelly for the drinks were good.

Overall food was good, service was excellent, and the place was clean. We would definitely come back!"
398,58,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,6/20/2017,"Boston is always a little behind on the food trends. It is hard to keep up with LA and NYC! But finally we have a poke place the city! I haven't tried Poké
City in Cambridge so I don't have that to compare. But comparing to other poke places that I have tried, this is pretty awesome!

They have a build your own option. You start with the base with either sushi rice or mixed greens. Then you can add mix ins from kale to edamame beans to grape tomatoes. For proteins, you can add  Grilled Chicken, Kanikama, Inari, Salmon, Spicy Tuna, Tuna, Kimchi Tuna Poke, Shoyu Ahi Poke, Rainbow Salmon Poke. They charge $1.88 for each raw fish option. Then you have a choice of delicious sauces and toppings that you can add for finishing touches. Then voila! You have yourself a poke bowl. If you are indecisive like me, you can order the preset ones. I ordered the Spicy Hawaiian Poke. It was super delicious! I like the shoyu ahi poke. I swapped the jalapeños for pickled ginger. The rice to fish proportion was on point. The fish was fresh. The flavors were delicious. I would definitely come back a try other bowls. There is something for everyone here, even non sashimi lovers. 

Don't forget to check into Yelp for the bottomless boba drinks! They are not like the ones I usually get at a boba shop but this is an awesome deal!"
399,59,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,7/8/2017,"A little late to the game; but they caught up finally! Poke has been all over NYC but happy to see a good one pop up in Beantown. Two sizes: snack (tiny little bowl) or regular (more meal size). You can build your own or you can select from their list. I was lazy and went with the Fenway special which has a rice base with some greens (think salad); corn and then salmon and tuna topped with spicy mayo. You can have a option for them to scorch your fish (which I did); adds a nice light crisp to it. They also have a option to by a bottomless tea options; for $3.06 you can have a all you can drink tea (the bubble tea is $0.50 and that isn't limitless) but for the drinks, you can drink your way through all their flavors ranging from taro, white peach, to lychee.  

Overall great portions and flavors and good quality fish. I would come back :)"
400,60,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,8/26/2017,"Pros:
-No line at 1pm on a Saturday! 
-Fair amount of seating. 

Cons:
-Pricey for portion size
--
Fenway Special ($12.25)
One of their most popular items. Very beautiful and pretty tasty. Sushi rice is great, but the portions of fish are fairly small. Overall, it seemed pretty expensive for the amount of food you get. I'd come back, but will definitely opt to make my own bowl with one type of fish to cut down the cost to around $8-9."
401,61,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,2/22/2017,"I'm not a fan of those create-your-own style food spots but when I saw the special menu with their own creations, I can dig it. The place is definitely trendy and cute. There are more seats in the back if all the high tops in front are taken. And each ingredient are neatly displayed and some was in their own separate little container, like raw fish, to keep them fresh and probably for portion controls. Smart!

Fenway Special ($11+)- Well, here's the thing... they didn't have any of the ingredients to make this, so I ended up customizing the bowl which was a little disappointing. I ended up choosing arugula, corn, tuna, sesame seeds with spicy mayo and unagi sauce on top of white rice. The half avocado would have made a huge difference in this bowl but they ran out, so they replaced it with unagi for me to compensate for the price. But hey, it's still a tasty sushi bowl. 
Crispy Noodle Nacho Hack- A bunch of crispy noodles in a bowl topped with spicy tuna, scallions, avocado, drizzled with unagi sauce and spicy mayo! So good. 

Overall Service: After picking what was available to put in my bowl, I decided to just dine there since there was space in front. As I'm sitting there, I overheard someone asking for avocado and they checked out back for to see if someone was preparing them. I thought that was a little odd seeing the answer they gave me was ""we're all out of those"". Oh boy. After eating as much as I can, I wanted to pack the rest for home and went up to the counter to ask for a lid. The gentleman who grabbed it for me was very personable and even asked me if I wanted to add anything else to the bowl, which was super sweet. Too bad I was too full at the time. I will be back to try their other creations!"
402,62,Love Art Sushi,2 star rating,2/11/2017,"All the new poke shops in Boston opening as of late are all the way in Cambridge (aka not close to me), so I was beyond excited when I heard about Love Art Sushi and came to check it out during it's soft opening week.

The good: 
- Lots of choices for veggies sides, unlimited even. So you can pile that bowl extra high. 
- They also have several varieties of toppings of fish.

The bad: 
- Service was incredibly slow. There was only 1 guy doing the toppings and the line was getting 10 people deep.
- I can't stand the fact that the toppings come in these little plastic dishes. It looks super cheap that they're pre-proportioned. It doesn't feel as fresh either. Oh and it's obviously not environmentally friendly. They can just train their employees to scoop the right amount of poke, like every other place...
- The poke tasted good but the servings are tiny tiny. With the regular bowl, I got the max of 4 different ones and it wasn't much at all. Why is there even a max to begin with? If you're hungry, there's Wendy's down the street..."
403,63,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,6/18/2017,"Sushi is arguably my favorite food. I'm always in the mood for it especially in the summer. Case in point, I got a sushi bowl for breakfast today. Granted, it was 1p by the time I got my food but it was still my first meal of the day. At the risk of sounding like a lazy POS, I used UberEATS to have the food delivered to my door so I cannot comment on the service or location. My food did arrive within 10 mins of the estimated time which I thought was super impressive.

Onto more important matters, the food itself. I ordered the two protein rice bowl with rainbow salmon poke, tuna, and a bunch of toppings. Being the big eater that I am, I also added the kimchi tuna makiritto to my cart. I am giving props to Love Art Sushi for not missing any of the gazillion toppings I had added to my bowl but I am knocking off a star because the quality is about the same as Whole Food's premade sushi. But bowls will run you around $10-15 and you get a lot more food than ordering just a sushi roll so I can't really complain."
404,64,Love Art Sushi,1 star rating,6/1/2021,Not sure what this supposed to be. Crappy frozen fish on overcooked rice. The can of coke was hot? My wife got so sick. The menu has nothing new or overly exciting... it's a cheap poke brand. Terrible
405,65,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,1/27/2017,"Another sushi / poke bowl place has opened up in Boston, and in my quest to find the perfect place (still haven't found it in the east coast yet folks), I had to try Love Art Sushi out.

I looked at the menu online prior to coming here and was very excited to see the unlimited veggie / fruit mix ins as well as a large selection of proteins. Lots of poke places here just have the super basics: salmon, tuna, shrimp and tofu, so I was thrilled that they serve spicy tuna and hamachi here. Other interesting items include spam and already marinated fish (poke).

You pay a flat fee to get a base plus veggies and any protein (or expensive veggie like seaweed salad and avocado) is an additional cost. There are some standard proteins for $1.65 and the premium ones for $1.88.

The line was long but at first I didn't think it was too bad. Since the server needs to keep adding whatever the customer orders, it may take a while.

However, as I moved along the ordering line to pick my items, I grew progressively more disappointed.

I get that's it's a soft opening so not all items are available, but the soft opening menu already had several options crossed off and when I ordered today they didn't have cucumbers, any kind of poke (except one salmon one which I am allergic to), or any hamachi. 

I was also shocked to see the proteins preportioned and stored in little to go sauce cups. They were SMALL. Seemed a little wasteful unless they reused them (but I think that's unsanitary and a health code violation for raw fish).

In the end I got two scoops of spicy tuna in my half filled bowl of white rice, corn, mushrooms and scallions. The portion was a huge bummer. I was still hungry after this. Also the other veggie toppings didn't seem like they belonged in sushi bowls: jackfruit, raisins, tomatoes...Overall my meal was lackluster, though I did add the miso dressing and really liked the flavor.  

Some suggestions:
- Make standard and premium toppings one price. The cashier has to stare at each bowl to decipher what kind of fish each person got and then charge based on the item. The difference between the two is ONLY 23 CENTS. If everything was maybe $1.75 that would even out the cost of the items but make the wait so much better for us.

- Get rid of the menu during this soft opening. You are getting customers' hopes up when they see the menu at the front of the line and then realize a ton of stuff isn't available.

- Get more tables and chairs! There's a generous amount of space but not enough actual furniture and I had to take my bowl to go."
406,66,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,3/13/2019,"It was my first time at Love Art Sushi and I did not regret it at all. I was nervous to go at first because I am a vegetarian, but you can make your own poke bowl and make it vegetarian. 
It was super good. It's a good place to hangout with your friends and have some good food at the same time. The employees there were super sweet too. Go! You won't regret it. 
Because I created my own bowl, I got rice as my base, edamame, bean sprouts, mandarin oranges, baby tomatoes, avocado, crispy noodles, and spicy mayo as my toppings."
407,67,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,8/3/2017,"Hey, so we almost missed this tiny place. After a long day touring Boston and Back Bay, we stumbled out of the subway and found this. Perfect end to a fun day: poké bowls of all flavors and options, and pretty reasonable for the area. The fish is fresh, the seasoning delicious. 

California Dreamin' bowl for non-sushi aficionados was nicely put together. We had three different bowls from the menu and one build-it-yourself bowl. You can't go wrong. 

Don't miss the mochi ice cream assortment. Maybe a little soft by the time we got back to the hotel room, so probably best to eat on site. Great meal. Highly recommended."
408,68,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,9/8/2018,"I tried this via ubereats because I was too lazy to actually make it here in person.  I ordered a poke bowl, tuna roll, and Vietnamese coffee.  Every item ordered was equally delicious.  The poke bowl itself was tasty and huge portions. I could barely finish it.  A huge plus is that they do not skimp on the salmon or tuna like other places.  The Vietnamese coffee is one of the best I have tasted!  Next time I will definitely visit the location because if the food is still tasty after being delivered all the way to Cambridge, I can only imagine how much better it must be if you order on site with no travel time!"
409,69,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,7/3/2020,Best poke bowls in Boston and the bubble tea with green tea boba is amazing! My favorite poke bowl Is the spicy one. They deliver and have take out service only at the moment.
410,70,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,2/1/2017,"I came here during their soft opening and was very surprised at how good it was, given that I am not a huge sushi fan. 

The location is in a random street right off mass ave across from berklee so you could easily miss it. 

The line was very long, but I imagine it was only because of the soft opening. They were also low on a lot of toppings/ran out to my disappointment. 

I ended up getting a bunch of veggies on rice, with spicy tuna, seaweed salad, and some type of salmon (not sure what he called it lol). You're allowed to choose 4 proteins/expensive veggie for free. Then at the end, you can choose which sauces to add. 

Even with the limited toppings they had when I arrived, my poke still ended up tasting amazing. They also have bubble tea!!!! 

Will definitely be coming here fairly often from now on :)"
411,71,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/9/2018,"In my opinion, one of the truest truths of this world is that poke (and any variation of sushi/fresh fish for that matter) is delicious. Love Art Sushi is no exception.

They offer a menu of bowls and the option to customize your own. I'm all about the customization. The bowls are on the larger side in my opinion and they don't just overfill it with rice. They give you a hardy portion of fish compared to other places. Fresh fish, the only type of fish we should ever expect. They also let you get unlimited standard toppings. They do charge for ""premium"" toppings like avocado, but in 2018, who doesn't? They have a variety of sauces to drizzle on top. I'm a bit fan of the sweet chili, but there's something to everyone's taste. To couple with that bowl, they have bottomless teas which I think is a sweet deal if you're going to sit down and hang out for a bit.

Love Art Sushi is good in terms of the Boston poke scene and for about $13, it's even better."
412,72,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,5/28/2017,"I ordered the shoyu-ken (whaddup Street Fighter) and added garlic sauce, which really packed a punch in terms of flavor. I also did the yelp check in for unlimited bubble tea. Totally worth it since I think unlimited bubble tea is $3? The cucumber drink was refreshing but the viet coffee was a little too sweet for my tastes.

I really loved everything about love art sushi, but I'm not sure if the fish was fresh since my stomach started to feel a little funny after eating."
413,73,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,4/9/2017,"Unlimited toppings!! Still in their soft opening stage, so not everything is available yet (e.g. hamachi) , but a pretty solid selection is. I like their gochujang marinated tuna - and usually I dislike tuna. One regular bowl can be quite filling because the staff make sure you know that you can have as many and as much of the toppings as you want! The sushi portions are a regular spoonful. I would recommend choosing two seafood portions, which will only come out to $10~. 

Definitely check in on Yelp for free bottomless tea! I liked their lychee cucumber tea with aloe. I think their strong point is definitely in their fruitier teas. The HK cappuccino was not for me, but they have small tasting cups so try them all first! I'm sure this place will be better known once they transition out of soft opening since they have a good number of seats as well."
414,74,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,7/12/2017,"Visited for the first time today and honestly ... it's love at first sight. 5/5 stars for food, service, and ambiance.

Custom regular poke bowl - 5/5
I had a half salad/half rice base with essentially all the toppings, seared kimchi ahi, and eel dressing. The quality of the ingredients were fantastic - everything was fresh. The serving size is very generous for a low price (especially since I was able to get a free protein topping for checking in on Yelp). The vegetable toppings are unlimited/free. I wanted to try all of them, and they didn't seem to mind at all. My bowl ended up being stacked very high with all sorts of toppings. I recommend torching your poke bowl - they will do it right in front of you! 

Bottomless bubble tea - 4/5
The teas are self served, and they have a wide variety to choose from. The flavor of the teas themselves are pretty good, but I personally think that they are a bit too sweet for me. The boba was interesting... it does not taste like the traditional chewy boba you usually find; it is more of a jelly/ aloe texture. I liked it though.

Ambience - 5/5 
This shop is so cute... they're got fantastic decorations. I could totally see myself spending an entire afternoon here doing work and drinking their bottomless bubble tea...

Service - 5/5
The people who prepared my poke bowl were so friendly! There was a line for the poke but it moved relatively fast. 

Would definitely recommend !! Perfect for a quick meal to go or a sit down dinner :)"
415,75,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,5/2/2020,"Wow, I can't believe I had never been to this place until today. Tucked away in a small side street, this spot was a true gem. I got to try the Sakura Matcha Milk and it was incredible!!!! One of the best drinks I've ever had hands down. When I went to pick it up, the food that they were serving up also smelled amazing. Honestly, I can't wait to be back to try their poke bowls. For now, I highly recommended their awesome bubble tea!"
416,76,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,10/12/2020,"I've tried my fair share of Poke bowls in Boston, but the bowls at this spot aren't my favorite. I usually build my own bowls, but the ingredients at Love Art Sushi don't taste as good compared to the other spots i've been to. The sauces are also not very good. Most are too sweet and the staff drowns the poke bowls in sauce. I've eaten here three times and have had the same experience on every occasion. However, Love Art Sushi had great indoor dining before COVID!"
417,77,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,4/3/2017,"I've been three times within the past 9 days just because of how casual and convenient this place is. The service is pretty good and all the employees have been very friendly.

There are plenty of options for ingredients, sauces, and toppings but you can tell that the ingredients definitely aren't fresh. Decent taste though, considering the price (my bowls usually end up around $10)."
418,78,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,4/2/2017,"The food was good, with plenty of options. However the amount of poke my friend and I received in each bowl was minuscule. The space is pretty big for a restaurants in Boston, however even with the amount of space there's a lack of actual seats. Would definitely come back for a quick lunch, etc. 
the drinks are amazing. Notable on their own, my friend and I had the lychee cucumber juice and was definitely the highlight of the restaurant."
419,79,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,7/1/2017,"Mm mm mmm tasty. A friend of mine is always eating here so decided to venture here myself today. 

I got the Fenway Special which is really good. It was had the right amount of everything: rice, spring greens , toppings, salmon, tuna and that sauce mm mm mm. My tummy was satisfied. It wasn't too little nor too filling it was just right.

I also got a drink and it's free refills if you dine in store. I filled my cup halfway with some Peach jasmine Tea which is good and when I finished that I refilled half my cup with the Taro which is soo yummy.

Came back here again just one week later. This is my new found place (love) for very fresh ingredients. Sweet Green is gonna get less of my time now. Shh"
420,80,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,2/8/2019,"I was getting caught in the rain when my friend had made a pit stop and noticed a sign directing us to Love Art Sushi. This hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant invited me with warm ventilation and the fresh smell of vegetables. 

If you must know, I'm a big fan of sushi and an even bigger fan of poke bowls. The multitude of options I can choose from blew me away, besides the sushi burritos, the poke bowls had a large array of different choices. Also, with the total ending up to be around $11, including a drink, Love Art Sushi seemed like every broke student's dream. An inexpensive yet tasty meal made my rainy afternoon and trip to Boston fulfilling. 

Although Love Art has a simple ordering system and cute decor, the eating experience isn't for the food, it's for the friends. You could easily pick up a bowl on the go and head out, but when you sit there with company, it makes the trip and your time there worth the while. 

I'm beginning to enjoy more and more of my meals when I head out with friends and if you like eating with company then Love Art is a perfect place to eat at. It's a great restaurant for a regular lunch, a hangout, or even a date."
421,81,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,7/6/2020,Absolutely the best poke bowls in Boston. Loved this place before the pandemic and now order take away from them. Simple pick up system. Their fish is always so fresh and the portions are substantial. Great place!!
422,82,Love Art Sushi,3 star rating,5/16/2019,"Came here for lunch after visiting the Mary Eddy Baker Library nearby. I got the poke bowl with imitation crab, which I believe was called California Dreamin'. It was okay - could have used a bit more flavor and the ingredients were each by themselves just okay. I probably won't come here again."
423,83,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,7/29/2018,"I really like this place out of everywhere else I've been to in Boston! The fish is consistently fresh and I love their refreshing, bottomless drinks! The interior feels like a cafe and I love to come with my friends to grab a bite and just chat with soothing classical music playing in the background. It's definitely nothing authentic and doesn't quite hit my craving from home in Hawaii, but I'll take it.

I also like how they spell poke correctly at this location, and not culturally appropriate it by trying to add that bizarre é at the end (like ""poké""). 

One star off for using plastic containers to serve their fish... wasteful and environmentally unfriendly."
424,84,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,9/20/2019,"For the price of the poke bowls, this is the place of you want some good poke for a relatively cheaper price! You can either make your own bowl completely from scratch or pick off of their menu (which you can also customize a bit to your liking). There's really something for every kind of taste bud. If you prefer to have something lighter, you can choose ponzu for the sauce (their sauces are all quite strong). They even offer the option to torch your bowl which was really cool. I got my customized bowl for only $9. Really nice place to grab a simple casual lunch or dinner."
425,85,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,10/3/2019,Loved this place! Had a small poke bowl of my own creation and a makiritto with salmon rainbow poke.  Delicious.  Everything was very fresh.  Also had the Thai iced coffee and iced tea with free in store refills.  Pleasantly caffeinated and full at the end :)
426,86,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,4/13/2018,"After braving a cross-country flight and the startling jump from 65 degrees to 30, I needed something to renew my faith in the world. Love Art Sushi was right near my hotel (the Sheraton) so I walked on over. 
They're knowledgeable about gluten AND the miso soup is gluten free! Win-win. My bowl had every imaginable topping and was around 12 bucks, pretty standard for poke. The fish was really fresh and well flavored. I love spicy poke and this delivered! 
The interior is also really cute and encourages you to linger, which is awesome because I was less than excited about going back outside. CA girl through and through."
427,87,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,3/22/2019,"4.5*
As you can likely tell from the name, this is a north American interpretation of Japanese food that caters to young people. That being said, for the most part they're doing a great job.
 
The fish has been consistently fresh which is already a win in my book. Aside from their bowls, they also offer snack sized mini maki rolls which are quite delicious and won't break the bank! 

The staff, like most of the clientele, consists of young college students who are generally very attentive and pleasant save the occasional ""too cool for school"" kid who looks like he would rather be anywhere else than taking your order! 

Overall, a very pleasant experience and a cut above the rest of the options close to symphony when it comes to a quick meal."
428,88,Love Art Sushi,4 star rating,4/25/2018,"First time into Love Art Sushi... loved the space, love the art, love that there is a fab poke place right around the corner from where I live.

It's definitely a little confusing, but I had expert help behind the counter. The ""poke master"" as I call her (in my head) had recommended the Hawaiian bowl, which was delish. And I added a handroll (they had a fancy name for it that I escapes me at the moment). 

All of it delish. Will go back again. 

It's not 5 stars only because it can't compete with to the delishness of west coast (or NYC) poke bowls, but for Boston, it's definitely bomb."
429,89,Love Art Sushi,5 star rating,8/7/2019,"My boyfriend and I tried this place today, as our go-to poke place is always pokeworks.

The great things about Love Art Sushi is that you pay a bit less for a three-protein bowl (about $12 versus $15 at pokeworks), and that they have a great drink selection (pokeworks is kinda lacking in that sense). They had taro tea, white peach tea, Viet coffee, cucumber lychee, and strawberry lemonade, as well as refrigerated drinks like ramune! They even had a small snack selection with things like chips and candies. The salmon and tuna were also very delicious. 

The cons... not a great add-in selection in my opinion--pokeworks has better options/-: I only got the kale and edamame whereas at pokeworks I get like 8 add-ins. Also, no dogs are allowed unfortunately (pokeworks allows them). I understand the reasoning behind this so I'm completely ok with it, but there are absolutely no signs outside that say dogs aren't allowed or that only service animals are permitted, which makes it a little confusing. 

All in all I would go back here, but not as often as pokeworks. I didn't try to make this a competition lol it's just that pokeworks was the only comparison I could think of!"
430,0,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,4/11/2022,"When a friend first suggested this place, I thought it was related to Earl of Sandwich in Downtown Disney. But Earls Kitchen + Bar is quite different! It's a nice restaurant, a solid staple especially given its proximity to the convention center. 

=Earls Bar by night=
Drinks are good here. Their cocktail menu is simple yet creative, featuring classics as well a handful of their own creations. They look pretty in the online menu pictures, but in reality it was too dark to appreciate the aesthetics. 

I got the COCONUT MATCHA SOUR (Tanqueray gin, matcha, passion fruit, fresh lime, coconut water, egg whites, kiwi extract). The taste was on point, and it came with a lot of coconut chips. For a tipsy Yelper like me, it was a nice snack to crunch on; however a craft cocktail purist may be less enthused, since it does throw off the balance.

My friends got the yuzu collins, ultraviolet lychee cocktail, and margaritas and everyone enjoyed their drinks. We got Don Julio shots too. Our server was friendly and attentive. We never got our additional round of drink orders, but that's probably for the better. Cocktails are ~$15 each, which is reasonable.

=Earls Kitchen by day=
We were seated at the patio, which was a beautiful and roomy space, with lots of greenery. Because of the heater, roof, and windows, it had all the relaxing vibes of outdoor seating without needing to brave the elements (I guess in Boston you can't really have an open rooftop bar...)

For starters, we shared the WARM SPINACH & 3 CHEESE DIP (pretty good! Ended up tasting like guac) and BUFFALO CAULIFLOWER (nothing too special, cauliflower pieces were small and had a lot of batter). 

The EARLS FAMOUS CLAM CHOWDER was satisfying, and I liked how it wasn't too salty or creamy. I got the MISO GLAZED SEA BASS + DASHI SOAKED GRAINS, but I sort of wish I got something more conventional like crab cakes, salmon, or steak. I appreciate all the thought that went into this dish with the shiro miso marinade, mushroom dashi broth that arrived on the side, and bok choy; however, it seemed somewhat like a hodgepodge of Asian-inspired flavors on top of the sea bass. I can't say the tri-colored quinoa paired well either, and the edamame were a bit distracting. Nonetheless, service was good and I still loved the ambiance.

Overall, Earls is an excellent choice if you're in the area. It's spacious and has a lot of variety on the menu, along with good drinks."
431,1,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,4/11/2022,"I've been coming to Earls for some time now as they have good food and drinks for a decent price. I decided to come here last night for a birthday dinner at 6:30pm with two other friends. We got some drinks at the bar downstairs as we were early and closed our tab when our table was ready. All went well up until we were seated. Things started to go downhill from there. 

We got to the hostess stand upstairs and we were told that our reservation was deleted and had to wait a little bit more for a table. There were clearly many open tables for a party of 3 but they decided to give us the short end of the stick and sit us at one of those high tops by the upstairs bar. The table was super uncomfortable and I could just see how we weren't going to fit our meals on this table. I had called over our server Paul and he had taken about 20 minutes to ask the hostess to switch us to another table. From here, we were all set and ready to order but no one came by to give us water or to take our order. I had called over another server but she had stated that Paul was still our server and we had to wait for him to take our orders. My party and I had made clear eye contact with Paul but he really didn't seem to care to come by and ask. We overall waited an HOUR for someone to come by which just made us lose our appetite. There was absolutely no communication within the servers from my perspective and it just seemed like no one wanted to bother with our table. We just made an executive decision to leave since we already closed our tabs downstairs and finished our drinks. Super disappointing because it was a birthday dinner and this seemed very disorganized."
432,2,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,4/8/2022,"I've been to Earls before for drinks, but this was the first time that I was there to have the food. I was there for lunch and it was fairly busy though not as packed as I thought it would be given the fact that there were no reservations available for almost any other timeslots. There were quite a few open tables, so I was confused as to why it seemed like there was no availability when there really was.

In terms of the food I would say the appetizers were pretty solid. The buffalo cauliflower was OK, with a little bit of buffalo sauce on top of some of the cauliflower. The calamari was pretty good. I liked the addition of jalapeños and asparagus and other veggies with it.

With respect to the entree, I got the lobster and shrimp ravioli and could say that I was thoroughly disappointed. There was very little lobster and shrimp on top of the pasta, the ravioli itself only had cheese which was very powdery and gritty, and the sauce was watery. I would not recommend getting the lobster and shrimp ravioli dish, especially given the price point. Part of the shrimp wasn't cooked as well which was concerning. 

The overall vibe of the place is nice, and the staff does a great job to keep everything going smoothly given a how hectic it can get. I would honestly come back for drinks and the atmosphere but don't think that I would come back for the food here."
433,3,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,3/20/2022,"I came here for a quick take-out meal and sat for a drink. Michael was a phenomenal bartender, and Tyler, the host, went above and beyond to deliver my take-out meal. 

It was so good that I came back the next day, since I heard they have a beautiful outdoor patio overlooking the city. It was raining, but we found that upstairs was even nicer than the bar downstairs, and huge! I ordered the steak + sushi and I got a chocolate cake. They forgot to put a candle in for my birthday, but I'm glad they didn't sing to me so it's cool. 

Josh was the most perfect server, he was super attentive and personable. He helped our table convert from a 6-person to a 3 party, and was able to balance the demands of the busy Saturday night, while making sure everything was absolutely perfect at our table. Corrine, the manager, was amazing and came out because I made a small complaint, which wasn't a big deal, but the gesture was huge! She's from out of state so she's not part of the typical staff, but I wanted to make sure she got her flowers for being extremely attentive and concerned. It's not really my business, but all of the people I've named absolutely deserve a raise for being phenomenal. My friends loved their steak, and it's a cool place to stop for food or drink!

They also make really good drinks, they're not too watered down like other local places. I came here 3 days in a row because I knew it was dependable for a good time and satisfying beverages, food + service. 

Also, it's very social media friendly. Every corner is perfectly designed to be Instagram-worthy, FYI. They have a nice, low-key bar downstairs, and they have a cool stairway up to the top floor. They also have an elevator for accessibility.

434,4,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,3/20/2022,"The good:
Great place for after work drinks and a few sharable dishes.  Busy, fun people watching and good bar staff. 

The bad: The main course I had was the steak and it was ok at best and for the price was not worth the spend.  Also had the spicy tuna roll and it was supermarket quality, maybe under.  

Summary, great for drinks and small plates, skip main courses."

436,6,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,3/3/2022,"We were agonizing over where to enjoy a rare meal in Boston and Earls was an excellent choice that exceeded my expectations. 

We popped in for lunch on a Tuesday. We work nights Sat-Mon so Tuesday brunch/lunch is typically a splurge meal and I will demonstrate that for you shortly. 

First impression: gorgeous dining area. Part of the kitchen is open so you occasionally spot a giant flame ball roaring above the stove. 

Our waitress was perky and friendly. Unfortunately, she broke the news that they hadn't received a delivery yet so they were missing quite a significant number of ingredients from the bar and therefore, many of the drinks on the menu were not available. Otherwise, I like that they have a ""better for you booze"" section with low sugar, low cal, and low alcohol options in case you're going for more of that kind of vibe. 

I, despite appreciating that fact, was not going for that kind of vibe. Fortunately, they did have all of the components of the cocktail I was eyeing, the PB&J with skrewball pb whiskey (where can I buy that shit lol), raspberry jelly, red wine, and fresh lemon and HOLY SHIT as I tipsily complimented the waitress, this may be one of the best drinks I've ever had and I certainly have enough data in that department. 

GF ordered a spicy mango margarita suggested by the waitress because they were out of an ingredient of her first choice, the pineapple mezcal sour (mezcal, lillet blanc, pineapple, and fresh lime juice) which she very much enjoyed. 

There were too many enticing options on the menu for us to do a standard, I-order-something-and-you-order-something deal. I'm vegetarian, and they conveniently have the plant based options in a specified section of the menu. 

Crispy tofu sushi tacos- crispy tofu, sriracha mayo, pickled ginger, and fresh shisho. Delicious. The tofu was certainly crispy and the flavors of these tacos mingled beautifully. 

Vegan buffalo cauliflower- so so so good. The buffalo sauce was bold and tasty and a perfect contrast to the cool vegan ranch dip that allowed me to even enjoy the accompanying celery stalks. 

Warm spinach and three cheese dip- oh my goddddddd. This was so good and CREAMY. This was old faithful of the meal that I kept coming back to in between samplings of everything else. 

Mother earth bowl- I saw this and it looked so fucking healthy and I just had to get it to cram all of that nutrition down my pie hole. Romaine lettuce, mixed greens, roasted yams, cauliflower, cheddar, quinoa almond crumble, broccoli pesto, white balsamic dressing. I ordered this for my soul aka to keep things moving in my belly but it was just as enjoyable as everything else. 

GF also couldn't resist the chipotle calamari-""very good, it was spicy and smoky with a nice crunch. The fried vegetables [included in the dish] were another nice touch"". 

I initially ordered all that shit with the intention of bringing some back to the hotel for later but panicked before the food was brought out that our hotel room didn't have a fridge. We had absolutely no trouble whatsoever eating everything and despite binging, didn't feel like complete shit about it which is a nice change after our usual taco bell binges lmao. 

I would also like to add that the food came out SUSPICIOUSLY quickly. 

This was an excellent choice and I couldn't recommend it more."

I am so glad I made reservations on open table as this is a popular restaurant. Wanted to find a place for myself to enjoy and relax. I was greeted by the kindhearted and friendly Letty and my server Sean was so sweet and attentive! They are the final reason I gave 5 stars as they took my overall experience to that level!!  The food was delicious, flavorful and pleasing to the eye.

438,8,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,12/28/2021,"This was my first time at Earls, I've heard a lot about it. My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary. We started with the classic margarita, I had the mango and my boyfriend had raspberry. We both enjoyed them. Then for apps we got the Buffalo cauliflower and the truffle fries. The Buffalo cauliflower is probably the best cauliflower I've ever had. It was fried and the sauce was so good. 

Then for dinner I had the lobster and shrimp ravioli, which was delicious. The ravioli itself was so good. My boyfriend had the Thai curry with shrimp. His rice was cold and also kinda hard. 

The server was nice but it was very clear he was trying to upsell everything. Then he would get visibly upset when you didn't want whatever he was trying to up charge you for. He was also a judgy when we were picking drinks. He was very attentive but it just came off a little aggressive."
439,9,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,3/11/2022,Went here for a quick drink and appetizer in downtown Boston. Both were great. Only knock I would say is that the staff wasn't the friendliest in our experience.
440,10,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,3/9/2022,"Arrived in Boston around 11PM, and Earls was one of the only places open. We had to wait a while to get a table without a reservation, but we were surprised by how busy it was--lots of young professionals hanging out. 

The table shared truffle fries and calamari. The truffle fries were disappointing, as they were pretty soggy and there weren't a lot of them. The calamari was great though! I enjoyed the pickled onions and how there were cauliflower pieces. 

I ordered the salad with chicken while my friends tried out the sandwiches and burgers. The salad itself was great, but I paid extra for chicken that didn't taste that great. I had a little bit of my friend's burgers and those were hefty and could definitely make for two portions depending on your appetite. 

Overall, the food was alright but the high prices and lack of unique options attribute to an average rating."
441,11,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,2/15/2022,"At a convention and there's not many places offering indoor seating (thanks COVID).   This one offered drinks and food, something I was looking for! My passion fruit mule was refreshing and tasted soooo good!  I ordered ahí tuna poke bowl and was so pleased.  It was eye pleasing and flavors were there.  My peer ordered clam chowder- yum!! Service was great until it was time to settle up, then we had to wait 30 additional minutes.  All in all, I'd recommend.  They also offer happy hour, worth returning."
442,12,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,3/20/2022,"If you are visiting Boston, I would skip out on this place. The place is beautifully decorated and trendy and in a prime location. However, the service was terribly slow where we hadn't seen our waitress for 15-20 minutes after being seated. The place wasn't too busy on a Sunday afternoon in March so I'm not sure what the reason was. The food came out in a fair amount of time as well as the drinks. The food was lacking so much flavor and seasoning. We came for brunch and the food tasted very bland and had no seasoning at all. The menu sounds delicious and is presented very nice but the taste wasn't there."
443,13,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,10/19/2021,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning with a reservation for two. I'd recommend making a resy for brunch especially as Earl's gets busy very easily!

The deal for brunch is fantastic. I find this to be a solid choice for well-priced food and a lively, fun atmosphere. The service is kind as well and very efficient - we got our food within a reasonable time and it was delicious. Their mimosas as well are moderately priced and complemented the food very well!

I found the eggs benedict to be just the right amount of food with the lobster portion to be reasonable given the price. The potatoes were cooked nicely too ( crispy and seasoned well ) and overall the meal felt very balanced. 

Earl's really never disappoints with food or drinks so if you're looking for a pleasant Americana experience, this is the place to go!"
444,14,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,1/1/2022,"Let me say, our bartenders Michael and Jeo were great!
My food...not so much.
Upon my first bite of my seafood eggs Benny it was cold. Jeo promptly took it back to the kitchen to be remade. 
When they brought it back out, while the hollandaise sauce was now lukewarm, the seafood was cold (I truly hope I don't end up ill)
I ate it because I refuse to send something back twice, I'm not ""that"" person and you can tell that by all my other reviews 
Your chef needs to make themself what they served me and ask themself if they would eat it the way it was served. 
Potatoes were hot, drinks were fantastic and my boyfriends food was great. 
Atmosphere is very chill."

It was a a clothed and unknown (play on a naked and famous)--vodka, elderflower, pineapple, lime, Campari and love 

If you ever go to earls (which you should), ask him to craft you a drink and he will make you something completely amazing  that you'll be craving for the whole week (it'll make your mouth tingle with joy)! He's completely fire and I wish I could rub my hands through is thick hair ughh

I really like the mango ale drink that I got. The beer is really fresh and just delicious. Our server was super nice and helpful. Overall a nice visit and great brunch spot to stop by!

We also got the salmon that came with a crispy onion rice and asparagus. It was spicy but good. We got the clam chowder which wasn't too creamy and had lots of meat. Not pictured were the truffle fries. Highlight of the meal for sure!"
457,27,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,5/24/2021,"Went here for brunch about a week ago. We sat in the outdoor area with a retractable roof. Fairly standard brunch food - the chicken was overcooked for the chicken and waffles. The shrimp and lobster benedict was good though - I liked that the hollandaise sauce was on the milder side. Both were good portion sizes and prices were very fair since we went during brunch happy hour. Mimosa and rose sangria were fine too. The mimosa was heavier on the champagne than the orange juice (which we certainly didn't mind) and the rose sangria was very sweet.

The outside tables could use more cleaning. There were a lot of food pieces between the slots of the table top, even though we were the first people to sit there that day. The contactless code for our table didn't work which required the server to come to our table."

First off the location is super convenient, once you've finished at Earls you can take a shopping trip around Prudential. The food and drink? Absolutely amazing. The drinks themselves are all so good, the Ultraviolet Lychee Cocktail is not only aesthetic, but also very refreshing. The Moscow Mules are also very good, gingery and sweet. You can easily just come here to enjoy the drinks alone.

The truffle fries are addicting, they're thinly cut so not only are they crispy but also fluffy within. The 14oz Ribeye with buttery mashed potatoes was the best part of the meal. Their steaks are tender, flavorful, and after spreading truffle butter across it completely elevated the dish. The mashed potatoes are smooth and buttery with crispy fried onion strips on top, so delicious. Can't wait to come back soon!"

I would give the food taste a 3.5 but I added 0.5 for the presentation.

The ambiance in the restaurant is modern and sophisticated but not to the point of it feeling traditional and stuffy. I would recommend outdoor seating as it's dimly lit indoors. 

Overall, I really recommend trying Earl's but the overall experience was better than the food. I recommend you try it for date night but do keep in mind it is a bit pricey."

We also got calamari and fries which were on the normal brunch menu -- calamari was good while fries were just average. We also got the half off champagne and OJ on the happy hour menu.

Full disclosure, I didn't get their brunch food but I still loved everything haha I got the Spicy Tuna Roll and their famous Clam Chowder. The chowder was delicious and not as thick as a lot of clam chowder's that I've had. It also had tomatoes in it, which I liked. All their rolls look very cool and the spicy tuna roll was so different than the standard. This one had some crispy onion flakes on top, that made it all the more delicious. The interior is so cute and there's a greenhouse looking area that you can sit in as well. Overall, 10/10!!"
466,36,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,3/13/2021,"**This review is during the COVID-19 guidelines for indoor dining. 

My friends and I came here for Saturday lunch and made a reservation a week before--which I highly recommend if you want to avoid a long wait!

Food: 5/5
I ordered the Vegan Quinoa + Avocado Powerbowl, which comes with roasted squash, beets, roasted pumpkin seeds, and crispy chickpeas. It was well-spiced, the portion size was decent, and the ingredients were all really fresh. I'd order it again in a heartbeat! The calamari was good but nothing special, the ahi tuna dish looked refreshing, and the chicken tacos seemed flavorful.

Drinks: 5/5
I didn't order any drinks, but my friends ordered some cocktails and they were fairly impressed.
Tokyo Cosmo - Citrusy, perfectly sweet
Raspberry Mojito - Refreshingly sweet raspberry cocktail
Mimosa - simple & sweet

Atmosphere: 4/5
The interior design is gorgeous, and it's a great place to go for brunch with friends or a date night.

Service: 4/5
We did feel a bit rushed since multiple servers came to check on us often (even though we were well within our 90 minute window), but the service was friendly and accommodating overall. I appreciated the payment process; you scan a QR code, and after you order, your virtual bill is automatically calculated and even splits the check between everyone at the table--I thought it was very innovative.

Overall, we had a great experience--a bit on the pricey side, but the food was tasty, the drinks were impressive,  the atmosphere was lively, and the service was friendly."
467,37,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,12/17/2021,"Love the creative healthier cocktails. I tried the lychee one, which also has ube in it. The portion sizes are large. The salmon is a bit over cooked and not crispy on the outside. The crab cakes are good!"
468,38,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,7/15/2021,"Ok so I'm debating on giving 3 or 4 stars because the food is alright, it's just really really uninteresting. 

So the location? It's GORGEOUS! Amazing! If you're a banker or work in a six or seven figure earning job than this is a nice looking place to bring some coworkers/clients for a drink or quick lunch. 
When I say pretty I mean it, the designer they hired did an excellent job. The materials of the tables and walls to flow of everything is great. A bit corporate-y but gorgeous. And what I mean is that it certainly doesn't show off any personality, no ones dream was this design. It's a upscale design firms work to appease a big client at a flagship location. 

Biggest Gripes - store bought sauces and presentation. 
BBQ ribs are over cooked slightly and slow cooked which while moist and tasty. They fall off the bone too much because they have been left in a slow cookers liquid for too long. And the sauce used tastes good but not made in restaurant, I'm speculating but am almost positive this is a particular sauce you can pick up at you local super market. So for the $30 you are getting some ribs and a tad dry but still good chicken and ribs. 
Don't get me wrong  the ribs were good but they were store bought stuff and made in slow cooker. For $30 you can actually get a slow cooker and a full rack of ribs! At the price point I'm expecting new flavours, something the chef has tinkered with and made his own. Wood fired, smoked, grilled even just something interesting flavour wise. 
This was the theme at Earls, everything tasted Good! But nothing was interesting flavour wise and it was a little bland and very generic. I wonder if Earls gives the chefs here any control over the menu to explore themselves creatively through the menu but I suspect not. A lot seems to be designed to make passable food that's tasty and price hike it to cater to the locations I'm sure ludicrous rent and their bottom line. 

Tacos were given this generic hot sauce in a the stores bottle with a label on it. At a place like Earls with their pricing relative to the market you come to expect a homemade sauce the chefs curated, or at the very least this store bought hot sauce in a nice serving glass of some sort. The label is just tacky in a place like this.  

Sushi was a bit bland and odd (fried shrimp) but in line with it all quite good. 

TLDR: Gorgeous place, good but uninteresting non passionful food. Wait staff was good attentive but not anything incredible either. If they want to make this place a top pick in Boston I'd say let your executive/head chef(s) experiment with the menu and food a bit and come out with some of their own stuff and lose the entirely safe dish menu that a corporate market study determined to be the best fitted food statistically to be ordered by the demographics."
469,39,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,1/7/2022,"I came here several times already and finally decided to write a review. I tend to come here during the brunch/lunch hours, and each time I'm never disappointed. The happy hour menu is so worth it and I believe it's 2-5 Monday-Friday. I got the seafood platter which had almost everything I loved; it came with lobster tail, shrimp cocktail (my absolute favorite), oysters, tuna salad I believe with chips, and tofu sushi. However, the sushi was not good at all so don't look forward to that. Other than that, everything was satisfying and good especially for the price. I would highly recommend coming here while you're shopping at the Prudential!"
470,40,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,4/7/2022,Anna is the most amazing server ive ever encountered!!!! I came to earls in prudential for the first time and of course i'll be back to see her!!!! Teresa was also such a pleasure! They made my birthday the best one yet!
471,41,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,3/7/2022,Salma and Taylor at the hostess desk are amazing! I go there all the time it's a great space!
472,42,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,8/1/2021,"They couldn't find my reservation in the beginning but it worked out and we are upstairs at the patio which was really hot. Additionally many items from the drinks were out of stock sadly. Our server was really nice since we had a party of 8 celebrating a birthday. The sea bass, steak and sushi were all very fresh and cooked well. Due to the pandemic, food orders tend to take a bit longer to come out which I completely understand. Overall a great experience with good food and an appreciative server and manager who checked in on us."
473,43,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,3/15/2022,"Place was great, amazing food, great atmosphere, cherry on top is the service: ask for Holly!! for those who want a more poetic review:

there once was a girl named josie 
she looked for a place real cosy 
walked through the pru, little she new
around the corner was something rosy 

earls was it's name 
josie was game 
but little did she know 
this was not a place 
no this was not a dinner 
this was an experience 
we had found a winner 

holly was great 
she felt like a mate 
the food was ornate 
the night had been made 

will we be back 
you can count on that 
shits fire 

ask for holly if you like a Wendy's 4 for 4"
474,44,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,12/6/2021,Lovely neighborhood spot. You can't go wrong with getting a drink here for happy hour or a meal. My favorite is the shrimp! Love the coconut flakes. My favorite drink is the Tokyo Cosmo.
475,45,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,7/29/2021,"Came here for the first time and was pleasantly surprised by the good food and nice service. If you want to get a table here for lunch, you should definitely make a reservation. The tuna tower was something I've never had before, but it was so delicious! The chicken tacos were super flavorful as well. Very happy with this meal and will comeback again!!"
476,46,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,1/1/2021,"Stopped here for lunch after shopping around Boston. And by stopped, we made a reservation a few days before. I would recommend making one as they were very busy and had a long wait!

The atmosphere was great, the rooftop looks over the city and is surrounded by tall buildings. The interior of the restaurant is very well done and a great spot to have lunch. 

The food was awesome, and if you can take advantage of happy hour you can leave with getting a fairly reasonable meal! The Christmas sangria was great and for happy hour only cost $7. For a starter the spinach dip was great and not greasy, the feta added a nice touch. For lunch I had the lobster tostadas and if you get an appetizer and don't want to overdue it this is a great option. Enough lobster to get your fix, and the flavors don't overpower the New England lobster flavor that you're looking for. 

All in all very happy with this stop, the service was great, our server was pleasant. Would definitely come again!"
477,47,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,12/30/2021,"I've been to Earls four times now and two of those times have been some of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. When I mean bad, I mean dangerous for your health. Upon receiving my cocktail, there was a woman's lipstick pattern imprinted on the rim of glass - clearly they had not thoroughly washed the glass. In seeing this, I am not sure how clean any of the glassware or utensils are in this establishment. It is hard for me to view this experience with anything but disgust.

On top of this, I ordered the the curry chicken bowl and when I received my dish, it was missing the chicken. The name of the dish has only two ingredients- curry and CHICKEN. I had to wait an extra 20 minutes after waiting at least half an hour.

I was going to let my first bad experience of this restaurant slide but this most recent one solidified my view - do not recommend."
478,48,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,11/13/2021,"I went here for the first time a few weeks ago with some friends late at night for some drinks and snacks. First off, the interior design here is very cool! It's very modern and fancy looking inside. We got seated in the deepest part of the restaurant in a booth area next to some bushes. We ordered the house margarita special which was great and cheap (less than $10). For food we got the truffle fries and they were delicious! The portion is on the smaller side so we ordered two. The only negative thing was that we did see a rat by our table. We did notify our server, but the rat was gone by then. Overall, cool place for food and drinks at a convenient location."
479,49,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,7/10/2021,The food was great!!!! We loved our dinner here at Earls. We had a burger and chicken tacos and both were very tasty. The only thing we didn't like was how LOUD it was. It felt like we were having a dinner at a nightclub.
480,50,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,2/28/2022,"First time dining here - based on how tough it's been to get a table here in the past, I was expecting a fairly good experience 
My experience was poor from the start - the hostess in the 1st floor told me they had a table, and she took my name, phone number - then pointed me to go upstairs to the hostess on the 2nd floor - that hostess struggled to find me in her queue for a table for some reason - but after a few minutes agreed to seat us in a round banquette 
We then waited quite a while for Dylan our waiter to acknowledge us, about 10 minutes after we were seated.  
We placed our order for drinks, appetizer's and entrees all at once. 
It took 20 minutes and 3 requests to get my first drink 
And another 20 minutes for my 2nd drink. When I asked the runner who was bringing the drinks what the issue was with the delayed drinks.........she seemed puzzled and assured me there were no issues at the bar? 
The food came in a timely manner, no issues there........except the food is over-priced for the quality - and you can see by the pictures, presentation is non existent. 
I asked for additional chips for the spinach dip - and waited about 20 minutes for the chips to arrive (I actually gave up and assumed they forgot about my request for more chips). Dylan explained to me later that they ran out of chips and someone ran to the store to get more - 
I asked for the check from Dylan, I put my credit card down as soon as he put the paper bill on the table 
He went by our table after that, Foy used on other tables - but when a manager asked she could get us anything else, I thanked her and stated I just wanted to pay the bill and get out of there 
Tyler is one of the managers - he stopped by a couple times and apologized for the poor service- he offered to comp the appetizers, I said no thank you - 
I assumed Dylan must be new, and that is why the service was so poor, but Tyler assured my Dylan is not new - so I replied that he needs more support from Managment OR more training maybe? 
This Earle's location seemed to be very well staffed this Monday night that I dined here - so, I am incredibly confused why my experience was so poor and it is is in complete contrast to most of the reviews here.........
I was torn between Earle's, Douzo, Cheesecake Factory and Fogo De Chao - any of the other portions could not have been worse than my experience at Earle's 
All around an incredibly bad experience that I had high hopes for............"
481,51,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,7/8/2021,"Honestly a great brunch place with a beautiful patio! I would say the food and drinks are ok but the ambiance of the place makes up for it. We came here since the friendly toast had a huge wait time. We had a table for 6 and after ordering, we were told there were some problems with our order. The both times I've been here, they are wonderful at accommodating for kitchen issues and I really appreciate that!"
482,52,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,11/21/2021,"Kalem is the best server we've ever had! He is very good with recommendations of passion fruit drinks and preparing spare napkins, ketchup, Sriracha aïoli sauces, and extra plates in case we wanted to share! He's beyond nice and he's very handsome with a very soothing voice and was completely professional! Side note the music here is amazing (: we recommend the crispy ribs and fried shrimp tacos off the happy hour menu along with the Atlantic salmon asparagus and rice. It's so clear that Kalem works incredibly hard and deserves a raise!! He is one of the many reasons that we will be coming back and we appreciate his check ins!!"
483,53,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,5/15/2021,"We had a beautiful dinner at Earl's this past Wednesday! We ate on the patio and it was absolutely love. The waitstaff were so kind and friendly, and made me laugh while I was waiting for my friend to arrive. The waiters were super cute too - especially one guy! Not that you should dine here for the cute waitstaff but hey, it doesn't hurt right? :)

The tables are safely distanced and they have QR code's for the menus. To start, we had the warm spinach dip. It was OK, but I probably wouldn't order it again. For my main course, I had the 6 ounce filet and mashed potatoes. That was SO good! I paired it with a lovely dry rose. All in all, a great meal and I will definitely be back!"
484,54,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,5/30/2021,"I've been to Earls a few times now, and never been  disappointed with the service or food. It has a nice interior, artwork, and is spacious for a large party or small gathering. 

It was my first time having brunch with them, and I ordered chicken and waffles. I have had chicken and waffles at other places before, and never felt satisfied, but this time was different. I really liked the way the chicken was cooked here. It was very crispy and moist, plus well seasoned. There was also some heat to it which was a bit unexpected but good nonetheless. My friends ordered lobster and shrimp omelette, lobster Benedict, and breakfast burger. They all seemed to enjoy their individual meals, and we all pretty much finished our plates. The only thing that was a bit underwhelming was my frozen margarita which was more slush than anything.  It tasted a little weak, which was disappointing because I've ordered drinks from Earls before, and they are usually good and strong, but overall, restaurant is good and somewhere I'd return to for future meals."
485,55,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,2/8/2022,Ambiance is really modern and cool. The food is good. I got the shrimp and lobster benedict which I enjoyed. The potatoes are crispy and well seasoned. I split a burger with a friend which was good as well. The mules are good and my friend enjoyed their espresso martini. Would come back again!
486,56,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,12/27/2021,90% of the staff has covid and management refuses to close for even a day. This is not new behavior for this place. Oysters were delicious! Wish I could give less than one star
487,57,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,4/26/2021,"I've come for drinks and dinner and it was great. However, brunch was just okay. Two of us ordered the eggs benny, but the eggs were overcooked, which was really disappointing. Buffalo cauliflower and chicken and waffles looked good, but service was slow and not the friendliest."
488,58,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,6/22/2021,"Came for lunch and I loved it! Ambiance was great and our server (I think his name was Michael) had amazing energy. I really appreciated his service and suggestions.

I had a yuzu crab roll and it was a fresh twist on the kind of classic sushi rolls you find in Southern California. I also tried a bite of the crispy shrimp roll, and it seemed to resemble a standard crunch roll but deconstructed. Friends reported that the poke bowls were filling and delicious as well.

Overall, it was a lovely experience and a great way to kick off visiting Boston."
489,59,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,11/7/2020,"Four stars for the food. Two stars for the service. 

Food: Notable mentions were the chicken and waffle, and the salt and pepper wings (appetizer). The Nashville fried chicken thighs were juicy, spicy and done just right. Waffles slightly overdone. Soft drink was 4.75. Definitely pricey for the value. 

Service: server got the wrong order, no napkin and silverware for a long time. 

Nice outdoor /patio seating though. You are probably paying for the atmosphere more than anything."
490,60,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,2/26/2022,"An ideal restaurant. 
Food: I liked it a lot. I have no complaints. 
Environment: an interesting and varied floor plan combined with suitably old yet fuzzy music and dimmer lighting gave the place a nice and private atmosphere while maintaining energy. 
Service: this was top notch. Shane T., our server, was incredibly energetic and helpful. I have a gluten allergy, and he was fully receptive to all of my questions and ran to the kitchen several times just to make sure that things were properly gluten free. That is a level of care that I have not experienced in the last year, and was wonderful. Overall a terrific experience."
491,61,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,11/4/2021,"I went here with my mom and my friend to celebrate saying yes to the dress!! Our waiter was super kind and brought us complimentary rose drinks as a celebration. As an appetizer I got the new england clam chowder which was delicious, just wish they had oyster crackers to go with it. For the entree, I got the crab cakes which were so yummy too! The dining area is nice as well."
492,62,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,10/3/2021,"Looking for the perfect spot to talk about your shopping spree in Prudential over drinks? Earls is the place to do it.
The truffle fries were a simple dish that they somehow made extremely addicting with their perfect frying job and the accompanying garlic aioli sauce.
This was topped by the New York striploin which had great fat content that you can see in every piece you cut but gave a good chew as well. The mashed potatoes that it came with had the most delightful fried onions on top and I found myself taking bite after bite no matter how full I got.
But you're not here for the food you're here for the drinks and the drinks at earls NEVER disappoints. Every drink is made for casual drinking and you won't ever taste the alcohol in it. The Moscow mule was so refreshing that I had to get another and the Lychee cocktail was sweet and mild.
This is my absolute number one staple restaurant and I don't think that will be changing any time soon!"
493,63,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,2/27/2022,"Food;amazing

494,64,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,10/6/2021,"I would definitely recommend coming during their brunch happy hour on Sunday (before noon). I got the eggs Benedict and a friend got the lobster and shrimp omelette. The Eggs in the Benny were nicely cooked and they gave a generous amount of potatoes. After you order, you can also scan the QR code and it will show you your tab which is very cool also."
495,65,Earls Kitchen + Bar,2 star rating,11/27/2021,"I've been to Earls several times in the past in Canada, the food here was very different! The sushi was pre rolled and tasted almost fake, it was not good at all - even grocery store sushi is better. The steak was chewy and only tasted good drenched in sauce. The waitress definitely forgot about me and the restaurant was cold / smelly."
496,66,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,2/8/2022,"Large menu with good food, nothing outstanding but nothing bad. Lots of fun drinks options. Cool interior design and location."
497,67,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,11/23/2021,"I went to this restaurant for the first time to celebrate a friend's birthday. We were asked to wait on the first floor which was moderately crowded with not many seats to sit and wait. 
For the table, we ordered the calamari. It was crispy and tasted delicious. Beware of the fried jalapeños because they have a kick. For the entree, I had the steak and sushi combo with the 6oz steak and the crunchy shrimp roll. The sushi was modern and had no seaweed, but also had a little too much cilantro taste for my liking. I ordered the steak rare, which it was, but it was also quite cold when it reached the table. The steak tasted great but would have been much better if it was hot. Overall, the ambiance is great and the service was very friendly."
498,68,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,10/2/2020,"Had a very tasty bunch here!! Wasn't my first time and definitely won't be my last visit to Earl's! They still do the same discount on Sunday brunch meals as before, so Sundays are definitely the day to plan your brunch! I had the chicken and waffles--it was really flavorful and had a good balance of sweetness and spice. Solid ratio of chicken to waffle as well. 

I also tried the lobster shrimp benedict--also good flavor! Potatoes on the side were tasty and poached egg was cooked well. As with most lobster bennys I wish there was just a liiittle more lobster.

Mimosas were affordable and yummy, no complaints there!

If you're making a reservation on opentable, be warned that they will give you the first available table (can't request outside or inside before getting there, but this wasn't an issue for me!)."
499,69,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,12/15/2021,"This review is mainly for their customer service. I go to Earl's quite often, pre-COVID this was our favorite Saturday night pre-game place, where ten of us would go and have few drinks before we head out to a club, during COVID we went few times for lunch and drinks but last few times have been really disappointing that made me write this review. Description of my last visit. We went for lunch on a weekday, to begin with, they had patio seating closed because their heating wasn't working there, that was disappointing because during COVID time I prefer patio than indoor seating.  This is not the first time, last time I visited they had some other issue outside , some Christmas decoration was going on outside so patio was closed, not sure why they don't want to seat people at the patio or just a co-incidence. Secondly, our hostess said the drink of the month is over, where we clearly saw it being served, so she had to get us the first round, which was watery, there wasn't much alcohol in it. Then for the second round she said it's over, then why is it drink of the month when their stock is over in the middle of the month, it's not like wine is perishable and sangrias are made from wine, so it did not make any sense, so we ordered the double priced cocktail which was good, but maybe not worth $17.5. Then comes food, it took them at least 30 minutes to get us food, only to realize that my friend's order was wrong, we couldn't wait because we were starving, so poor guy had to eat alone because his order took another 15 minutes or so and we were starving because the order already took 30 minutes. I ordered the zen bowl which comes with tofu,  mushroom, snap peas etc. i replaced rice with greens, so my so called zen bowl was greens, cucumber and tofu, that's it, nothing else for $27, it was ridiculous how overpriced the dish was which was missing key ingredients and when I asked the waitress she said it doesn't come with mushrooms and snap peas, then better write that in your menu and change the name to tofu with rice or greens. I had a similar experience last time, their dessert which used to be my favorite, sticky toffee pudding, had no toffee and a tiny scoop of ice cream and waitress said the ice cream is really small so I recommend you order extra scoop (when you know it's small, why don't you offer more), so that scoop was of course extra price and for toffee, she said no we only put toffee when we have it, today we don't have it. Like really, then why don't you inform your guest before ordering. I have so many bad more stories lately about this place which used to be good but is becoming a very poorly run restaurant. They gave us a $10 credit for the mix up, but I feel that was very less compared to the bad service we received. Not sure if these people waitresses/ managers are racist or just poorly trained people, maybe they started hiring untrained people to cut down prices and cheat customers. Whatever it is, all of us decided this won't be our go to spot anymore."
500,70,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,7/16/2021,"We dined in on Tuesday's evening. We were very excited to come to this place. We came all the way from NY. We felt very unwelcome by the host on the first floor. We were waiting in line for so long when she was chit chatting with the customers in front of us. People behind us just went up so we thought it was okay to do that. Then we went up and she stopped us and made the face. She waved the hands for us to go up without making eye contact and giving any attention. Giving attention to customers is very important but she left me in nowhere. We do not appreciate that at all because the hostess team is the first impression of the restaurant.

However, 5/5 for the food and thank you for an amazing service from the waitress. We at least enjoyed the food and our time at the table after all."
501,71,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,11/5/2021,"Truly enjoyed the food! Incredible ambiance on the patio, even in the winter. Steak was cooked perfectly, and the truffle mashed potatoes were everyone's favorite."
502,72,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,7/31/2020,"I came on a Friday evening with my boyfriend and a friend. We had a reservation for seats in the rooftop patio, which was great since I wasn't comfortable with sitting indoors yet. It was pretty crowded, both indoors and outdoors, when we arrived. Luckily, the outdoor seating was spaced relatively far apart.

We ordered truffle fries, and chips and guacamole. I also ordered an old fashioned. The truffle fries were the star of the night! They were so freaking delicious and flavorful! I wish the portions were bigger because I would've happily eaten at least 5 more orders of those truffle fries! The chips and guacamole were fine - exactly as you'd expect. Nothing special. There was a lot of guacamole, and the chips were refillable for free, which was pretty great! The old fashioned was very unique. It had root beer bitters, so if you'll like it if you like root beer.

The waiter was very friendly and attentive! 

Overall, we had a great time! I'm truly obsessed with their truffle fries and can't wait to come back for more!"
503,73,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,8/26/2021,"Short version: The staff are wonderful, the drinks are good, the food is eh.

I don't usually grimace at the thought of going to Earl's because the food is reliably pleasant, but it's nothing out of this world or that will make you disavow your mother's signature dish. The cocktails however are solid (the earl's old fashioned is my fave). What I can always count on though is pretty decent service and a warm atmosphere. Now, I have been to Earl's on a number of occasions but usually visit the location in Somerville. I will be the first to admit that I'm a bit bougie (bourgeois if you wanna be proper) and am a stickler for customer service. The décor and the way that the greenery is infused even for rooftop seating is so pleasant and naturally comforting. The customer service is always attentive and pleasant, but what encouraged me to write a review is May. She went out of her way to just be so on point. We never had to search for her or wait an extended time for anything and this restaurant was pretty busy when we arrived. She was patient, kind, and gave amazing recommendations. Like I said, it wasn't my first time here and likely won't be my last but wanted to be sure that May got her props!

P.S. for the COVID conscious folks. Not sure if staff is fully vaccinated (I'm assuming so), but they are currently operating and not requiring masks for staff, chefs, or guests so it was a bit uncomfortable this go round with the Delta variant and all so I likely won't be back anytime soon. The tables are also not socially distant, but if the awnings are open then their rooftop is an option to minimize risk"
504,74,Earls Kitchen + Bar,1 star rating,8/19/2021,"It sucks that one bad experience here forced me to finally write a review.. let me start by saying that I have historically LOVED Earl's. As someone who lives in Back Bay, it is typically a go-to for drinks and apps, and especially when I want to show someone a nice place when they are visiting me in town. I have frequented this place so much, but not sure if I will be returning.

I last went there in May with family who was in town for a graduation. The service was great as usual, and most of the drinks / apps were great as well. I wanted to order the thai curry chicken bowl, but upon the recommendation of the served, I ordered the cajun grilled chicken. Well that was the worst decision I made that day -- upon receiving it, I noticed that it looked severely undercooked and practically inedible. Only the outer layer was somewhat cooked. When I told the server, he dismissed my complaint and stated that it was supposed to look like that and was most likely cooked. I was a bit shocked that they did not listen to such a serious concern, but I trusted my favorite establishment and listened. It was not until later after a eating a few bites and the insistence of my family that I realized that it was most definitely undercooked, and I had no choice but to complain again and physically show my server the inside of my chicken. He apologized profusely and offered to bring me another entree, but I felt sick at the time from the raw meat so I declined.

My family was extremely disappointed that our concerns were not only ignored, but when acknowledged, there was little done to remedy the situation besides an apology. It turned a family celebratory occasion into a night of cramps and stomach pains for me. It is such a shame because I loved Earls, but I honestly do not know if I will ever have a reason to come in again."

Wanted to take my girlfriend out to a nice spot for her birthday and earls was recommended by another friend who told me that it was a good date environment! They were right! It had good vibes and was classy without being TOO classy. Food was good and service was great! Tables were separated and we ate on the covered patio. Only downside was that the music was a bit loud."
506,76,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,1/3/2021,"We arrived on time for our reservation. It's my first time. The host and hostess were very friendly and warm they told us about the specials. We ordered sushi , salads, lobster ravioli , ribs and fish tacos. They spicy tuna roll was excellent. The ribs were tender and the sauce on the ribs very good. The ravioli heaven. The only thing that was average were  the fish tacos. The tacos were a little cold and for blackened fish they did not have much flavor but did appear blackened. The strawberry Moscow Mule was good. The server was pleasant but didn't inform us of specials. We had to ask her many many question. The food came out fast and hot except the tacos. I  would return only on Sunday for specials. The food was good but service average. It was not an excellent value or anything extraordinary."

A special SHOUT OUT to the hostess Natalia (from NJ too!!!!), our waitress Yessica and server, Olivia!! You ladies are awesome!!! GREAT VIBES AND GOOD ENERGY!!
We sat in the terrace area which I highly recommend especially on a beautiful afternoon!!!

SO I'm comparison so other restaurants in the area: 

Ambience- pretty decent! It's spacious and has a really nice little rooftop patio thing. The tables were big, didn't feel overcrowded at any point! 

Drinks- the drinks were decent. Got pitchers of mules which were delicious but expensive. This is where the comparison comes in- compared to other places in Back Bay- NOT that bad! 

Food- didn't get a chance to order food here unfortunately"
509,79,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,8/14/2021,"We were traveling from Los Angeles to visit our Daughter who attends Northeastern and thought we'd give them a shot. We didn't have reservations but put our name on waitlist. We were told it would take 15-20 minutes. After about 35 minutes I went up to see where we were and hostess said probably another 20-35 minutes, ugh. We waited, then in about 1 hour we got called up but then had to wait another 20-25 minutes to get seated. They need a better system. Good news and reason for the 4 stars is that the food was amazing. Had the Filet tenderloin and wife had Mother Earth bowl with salmon, both were amazing!  Would go back just with reservations only!"

511,81,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,5/29/2021,"So glad I found this place on yelp!  Had a quick 1 night in Boston when the city still had lots of covid restrictions and I was thrilled to be able to make a late night dinner reservation at 10:30pm on a Thursday.  When we arrived in the mall the downstairs area of Earls was empty and a sign directed us upstairs.  I was so worried (and hungry) thinking the restaurant wouldnt seat us and they were closing.  Well was I wrong!  We went upstairs (total Vegas restaurant vibe) and this place was hopping!   This restaurant is absolutely HUGE!  So many seating options- tables, bar, high tops and even semi outdoors.  The desk had my reservation & seated us immediately.  Covid restrictions limited our visit to 90 mins, but since food & drink came out so quickly we enjoyed multiple drinks and a meal.  My hubby & I loved each hand crafted cocktail we had, my veggie sushi was good, and my husband loved his steak.  Best of all was the club like music, live plants, , cozy couch benches & privacy walls between tables.  Next time I am in Boston I will def come here again.  Huge menu & such great cocktails & atmosphere.  Thanks Earls for the late night dinner option!"
512,82,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,10/12/2021,"My partner and I came here in a whim and loved it. The service was phenomenal (we sat at the bar) and the drinks were even better. We had the steak and sushi and while the sushi was great, the steak was too chewy for us and we had to return it, but this is to no fault of the bartender or really even the kitchen, it just wasn't a great cut. Overall, we had a fantastic time and will be back again whenever we have something to celebrate."
513,83,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,6/15/2020,"I used to come to Earls often for drinks with friends. Great patio and honestly the drinks never disappoint. 

The food however always seems to fall short. I've tried ordering the chicken tacos twice now and every time I do they are really just filled with cabbage and tomatoes, barely any chicken, the flavors are good from the jalapeño cream, but still extremely underwhelming. 

And same with trying the California burger. The burger was just okay, I felt the avocado was really missing as was the sriracha mayo, making it just very average. Definitely not bad but has potential to be so much better."

Two Caesar salads, two burgers, and some fries is not a huge sampling of the menu, but everything was cooked perfectly, tasted great, and made us want more. 

Service was awesome, sadly don't recall the waitresses' name, but made us comfortable and was engaging beginning to end. 

Interior is great too. Loved the layout and decor. Will be back for sure."
515,85,Earls Kitchen + Bar,3 star rating,11/13/2020,"The atmosphere is amazing on Earl's rooftop, but unfortunately, the rest of the experience was just average. Reservations were completely booked up, but when we arrived, we were able to get a table in 20 minutes. They also validate parking.

We all ordered different dishes and all reported that the atmosphere was better than the food. Two of us ordered chicken, I ordered their plant based sushi, and one of us ordered a poke bowl. 

Service was particularly slow, as other reviewers noted. Our waitress was incredibly sweet, but it seemed like the kitchen was backed up based on the amount of time we waited for food/drinks. It seemed like the wait was out of her hands. Two of us asked for sides of sauce, and I asked for a side of rice; unfortunately, everyone else was basically done with their meals by the time the sides arrived. We didn't have napkins until about halfway through our meal. Not to mention, my boyfriend asked for a few ramekins of sauce and the kitchen said they have a limit on how many sauces are provided up front.... this caused our poor waitress to go back to the kitchen 3 times for sauce refills.

One of us ordered a refill drink twice because the first never came, and then both refills came out at once. Two of us ordered fruit margaritas, which were average and pretty overpriced.

You are definitely paying for the rooftop experience and location! A bit disappointing, but I probably wouldn't come again."
516,86,Earls Kitchen + Bar,4 star rating,9/27/2021,"I was close to giving a 3-star but that would be unfair to the service and the overall ambiance of the restaurant. Instead I will start off with the negatives: 

The food is extremely overpriced and you are exclusively paying for the location/venue. I say this because the food is average-to-below-average and it is very very pricey. 

The quality of food felt very chain-esque. Our margaritas were below-average as you could just taste the sweet, tart margarita mix they used. 

The service was great as our waiter was nice, quick, and checked in on us. We even got an additional staff to check on us just to see how everything was going.

The venue is great and it is definitely a must-try for drinks (if getting a basic cocktail or beer, don't bother with margarita or specialty drinks). 

The service and vibes are what kept this review from being a 3-star"
517,87,Earls Kitchen + Bar,5 star rating,6/22/2021,I stopped in with a friend for a drinks and appetizers. We were thrilled with AJs service. The manager Cody stopped by to check on the service and we were happy to report that everything arrived  on time and as expected. The ambiance and lighting make for a great dinner atmosphere. This restaurant does not feel like a large chain restaurant at all. I was excited to see they have added espresso martinis to their drink menu. YUM! Sometimes they even have a Dj on premises. Be sure to ask about their specialty cocktails and the truffle fries are a must.

520,0,Giacomo's,4 star rating,2/23/2022,"I was desperately craving some good Italian food. Something that my grandma would make on a Sunday for the family. REALLY I wanted spaghetti and meatballs, something so classic, with lots of cheese on top. I saw some great reviews for Giacomo's so we gave it a shot!

There is no reservations, walk in only. When we arrived there was a line but I didn't mind! We waited about 15 min and were able to snag a table.

First glance at the menu it's predominately seafood based. Makes sense. But meatballs were listed as an app! When our waiter came over we ordered some garlic bread to start and I inquired about the meatballs. He was honest and said ""you don't want that"" so I scrapped that idea and settled for linguine with calamari. My bf got the linguine with shrimp. 

The garlic bread was SO garlicky in the best possible way. It was simple and yet so tasty. I recommend saving a few pieces to dip into your past sauce.

Now my main dish I was really disappointed by. The calamari was all clumped together and very chewy. It also tasted SUPER fishy. I drowned it in some fresh cheese and ate it because I felt bad sending it back. Now my boyfriends dish? SO good. A great balance of flavors and the shrimp was perfectly cooked.

I'd come back for sure but maybe get something else. I do highly recommend the garlic bread and that linguine with shrimp!"
521,1,Giacomo's,3 star rating,12/22/2021,"To be honest, I'm not sure what the hype is all about. Ordered the bruschetta as well as lobster ravioli.

The bruschetta was pretty good, but nothing special in my opinion. Nothing unique but also nothing bad about it.

The lobster ravioli is what this place seems to be known for so we ordered it! First, there's only 8 pieces of ravioli that come with it and second, the taste of the ravioli is pretty bland. The sauce (or more like soup) the ravioli is in was pretty tasty but wish it was a thicker and creamy consistently.

Overall, not the worst Italian place but I wouldn't say it was any better than your regular Olive Garden?"
522,2,Giacomo's,5 star rating,12/8/2021,"Wonderful restaurant. We were wandering around little Italy and could see all the people eating in the window. Food looked great so we decided to put our name in and the line was short.
So glad we did. 
We got the grilled octopus appetizer, the lobster, clams and mussels over linguine, and the twin steamed lobsters.
Everything was great. The grilled octopus was tender and had a great flavor.
For the lobster, clams and mussels we had the half spicy, half regular sauce and it was wonderful. 
The twin lobsters were ridiculous. Two huge lobsters with butter. 
Waitress was really great, but food was just amazing."
523,3,Giacomo's,5 star rating,2/5/2022,"A two location restaurant in Boston, one in Back Bay and one in North End. We love the one in Back Bay because of its family oriented/style. In any event, both places serve delicious food. See pictures."
524,4,Giacomo's,5 star rating,4/1/2022,"If I could eat one pasta dish for the rest of my life, I think Giacomo's lobster, clam, scallop linguini would be it. I came here last weekend while family friends were in town. They were avid fans of Giacomo's in north end, and said this is the only Italian restaurant they go to in Boston. We went to the south end location, which was not that busy when we walked in around 5, but turned very lively around 6 for dinner rezzys. The service was phenomenal -- from the waiters and servers to the managerial staff -- and I would come back in a heartbeat. Would highly recommend the pasta special for two (it can actually feed 3-4), the calamari, chocolate ice cream, and tiramisu."

TIP: there are 2 Giacomo's locations. Back Bay and little Italy (North end) 
Don't get these 2 locations mixed up. My party did and my bf ended up at the north end location, and taking the T back to the back bay location where my party was waiting for a table. 
CASH ONLY!! 

Giocomo don't seat the party until all party has arrived!! 

We waited for the last person of my party to arrive, which was my bf. He ended up being 1hr late. Although after he arrived, the host provided us a very nice outdoor table towards the end of the restaurant where it was quiet for a dinner chat. I'm so thankfully we didn't get seated inside. It was loud af. 

WHAT WE ORDERED 
Calamari $12 
Caesar salads $10
Shrimp and scallops linguine with Giacomo's sauce $19 
Scallops linguine with pesto $20
Mussels and clams linguine with fra diavolo sauce $19
Prosciutto and peas in a garlic cream sauce fettuccini $17  
Lobster ravioli $20 
Their signature ravioli, this is a must when you're at giocomo 

Our total came out to be $145, which was a very reasonable price for a party of 4. We came from california, we would not be able to get this much food in CA with the price. We were thrilled with the quantity and quality of Italian food. I highly recommend giocomo to visitors in Boston."

-1 for the parking, I'm sorry but there is literally no where to park... and their value parking is 15 even on a week night.., like why? 

-1 I'm not sure if it was the owner or host but he gave off the vibe like the restaurant didn't need our business. The service was ok. 

My cousins linguini calamari and mussel pasta was quite good. 

-1 Sadly I didn't like my butternut squash ravioli... I thought it would be better. It was creamy tho.

529,9,Giacomo's,5 star rating,8/29/2021,"Debating on where we should celebrate the birthday girl, I came across this place after reading many amazing Yelp reviews. And thank you all, because this place was amazing. 

The little Italy of Boston, north end, was way too crowded and difficult to find parking. So I tried to steer away from the crowd hoping that we don't have to wait to long to dine. It seems like they accept reservations since a few people came in stating they had reservations. After half an hour wait on a rainy Saturday around 7 pm, we finally got seated. They were so packed that they were cramming three people in a two people table. It's ok, it's totally worth it, covid is history for this place. 

We ordered the lobster ravioli and zuppa de pesce (dinner for two). Amazing. Totally worth its value and the seafood was so fresh. The sauce they recommended was amazing as well. My favorite is definitely the lobster ravioli. The white sauce with it is like crack where it makes you want more and more. I literally took the bread to dip into the sauce, yeah it was that good. 

Oh and btw they're so busy, no time for questions or to write your name down. So make sure you announce yourself to let them know you're waiting and for how many people. the NYC side of me kicked in so we were able to secure a table :) . Just kidding, just make sure you make yourself known. 

Cash only or Venmo!"
530,10,Giacomo's,3 star rating,7/30/2021,"I heard so many good things about Giacomo's. After living in Boston for almost 6 years, I finally decided to try it. I came for an early dinner so there wasn't a wait. I ordered the linguine with mussels and clams with scampi sauce. 

The pasta and sauce were great but the seafood had sand in it... at least that's what I'm assuming it was. I felt this gritty sandy texture when I bit into the seafood (I think it was mostly from the clams, but it could've been the mussels too... not entirely sure). This kind of ruined the dish for me to be honest.

Overall, I don't know if this place is worth all the hype. I mean the food and service were fine (minus the sand in my dish, which other Yelpers have also pointed out), but it wasn't anything extraordinary. Maybe my expectations were too high. I might give them another chance and order something without seafood if I ever come back.

FYI They are cash only."
531,11,Giacomo's,5 star rating,7/9/2021,"Wow just wow. This was an amazing dinner to end our night in Boston. Everything was so delicious. I swear you can order anything on the menu and its just going to taste amazing. 

At first when we arrived, there were no more outdoor seatings so we were seated inside then it was kinda warm inside so we asked if we could sit outside instead and luckily a table open up and we were able to relocate with no issue. The weather was nice on our last day and not chilly like it was the first few days of our stay so we were able to enjoy the weather.

We both got pasta and it was freaking delicious! I tried the fracomo sauce and I cannot get enough of it. It had a hint of spicy and I was freaking loving it. I want some of that sauce back home now but this place is a must and so worth."

Pasta is plentiful and tasting great. But what on earth is up with this ""house salad"". It's spring mix and a side of dressing. I never ever complain at restaurants, I'm in the service industry, I'm not trying to be a Karen, but seriously what's up with the bowl of lettuce for SEVEN DOLLARS. There were no modifications to remove toppings, you order as-is. Hopefully this was a fluke. Otherwise buyer beware I guess."

535,15,Giacomo's,1 star rating,8/29/2021,"Great food, bad service.

We have been coming to Giacomo's for years and the food and service is always great. However, this recent visit left us disgusted. From the moment we stepped into line, we sensed a hostility between the wait staff, specifically instigated by a women who, in less kinder words, had the Karen blonde bob. She was incredibly disrespectful, belittling her fellow coworkers in front of all the restaurant customers. From yelling at them to leave tables alone and stating ""I told you to leave it! What are you doing,"" she raised her voice numerous times causing many heads to turn towards her direction. 

After we were seated and got ready to order we waved hi to her in order to get her attention. She immediately snapped back at us stating ""be patient! wait your turn"" with hostility and attitude. After that encounter our table of 3 was in disbelief in the level of disrespect that we experienced. Never in our lives had a server overtly treated her coworkers and customers so poorly with an audience. 

After that encounter, we lost our appetite and did not want to stay any longer near her presence. We left immediately still reeling over what happened.

The management needs to prioritize customers and not keep an employee who is so incredibly dismissive and rude to everyone around her."
536,16,Giacomo's,1 star rating,12/24/2021,"Alert: Avoid as much as possible. they don't want / appreciate your business. They probably consider you to be another annoying tourist that makes their life miserable by dining in.

Tried to go in on Christmas Eve but came a little bit early I guess (around 5pm). the moment we opened the door the old lady sighed ""ughhh"" (so loud and obviously pointed at us) like they don't want any customers (the restaurant seemed pretty full that time so it's not that they were resting or anything) 
Why would I want to do business with them if they don't want any diners because it's extra work load for them? If they don't want business that's fine, we are not gonna dine in thanks. We stepped out the moment the lady sighed so loudly. Why would we wanna pay any penny for unappreciative brat?"
537,17,Giacomo's,4 star rating,7/18/2021,"5 star food, 2 star service. 
Food is amazing. You choose from several amazing sauces, then pick your seafood and it all comes on linguine. It is the epitome of ""one thing done extremely well."" So tasty. 

The service is very much in the vein of ""you should be thanking US for allowing you in the restaurant."" You wait outside, which is fine, but it's just constant attitude from the servers that you are a nuisance. When ordering meals, one party member ordered calamari as his meal (wasn't very hungry) and the waitress said ""okay, but it's gonna come out first, you know.""  No offer to have it come out with the meals. Very much just ""you get what you get.""  The waitress took my empty wine glass without saying anything. I had to say, ""oh hey, actually can I get a second glass of Chianti?""

So. Good food. Service is my very least favorite kind. Not even ""bad"" really, just very rushed and pompous."
538,18,Giacomo's,5 star rating,2/8/2021,"Found this wonderful small neighborhood restaurant a few minutes walk from the Marriott Copley Place hotel. Got there early on a Monday night so no trouble getting a table...all the staff were very friendly and professional. Very nice and affordable menu selections. I asked the waitress for recommendations and she named a few then said they also had a pasta special...lobster and shrimp over homemade fusilli with a choice of a number of sauces. Being a pesto lover I chose that.

The food arrived within minutes...and it was magnificent. At least 6 jumbo shrimp and 10 lobster clawsl. The sauce was amazing and I struggled to finish it...a large portion indeed.

Highly recommend Giacomo's if your in the Back Bay/South Boston area!"
539,19,Giacomo's,5 star rating,6/21/2020,"TLDR: wonderful Italian food with a seafood focus. Not sure if it's always cash/Venmo only or just a quarantine thing. 

Broke my quarantine with their outdoor seating. Tables were all spaced apart more than 6 feet. Our waiter wore a mask and gave us plenty of space. The calamari was freshly fried and I love that they had fried peppers in it as well. I got the clam and musssels linguine in their giacomo sauce while my wife got the veal. Overall a great meal."
540,20,Giacomo's,4 star rating,7/26/2021,"I was heading to Mass for a wedding and decided to stop in Boston for the day with a group of people. While looking at restaurants, I came across Giacomo's so I proceeded to ask my cousin, who lives there about the restaurant. She explained to me that the food was worth the wait that we would experience so we decided to give it a go. 
 
 PARKING- Parking downtown Boston is like parking in every major city. You look for the nearest parking garage and walk. If you're looking to make your life easier and don't mind paying possibly a few dollars more, I would highly suggest Uber/Lyft/taxi.

SERVICE - The service we had is the reason this restaurant didn't get a 5-star rating. The waitress was extremely rude and short with us. She didn't seem to have any time for questions and came off as we were a nuisance that we didn't have our order ready the minute we sat down although we told her we had never been there before.

MENU - The menu has a good selection of Italian food. If you like Italian food, you will find something you like here.

FOOD/DRINKS - We ordered two glasses of wine and a beer. The selection was good and was easy for us to select something we liked.

For appetizers, we ordered mussels, calamari, and fried mozz. The mussels and fried mozz were very good but we never got the calamari. After the apps came, we tried getting the attention of multiple staff members who advised they would let our waitress know but the message was never delivered. Although they didn't forget to put it on the bill. Not getting the calamari was a bit disappointing but it is what it is.

For dinner two of us got the Frutti di mare on the menu and two of us got a Frutti di mare special. The food was fantastic and the sauce was arguably the best fra Diavolo sauce I have ever gotten at an Italian restaurant. The ONLY thing I wish they did was make homemade pasta as that would have made this restaurant probably the best Italian restaurant I have ever eaten at.
 
 PRICES - The prices we fair and the portions were good.

OVERALL - The only complaint we had was service. But I would still highly recommend this place and if we were ever in the area, we would still return. Restaurant deserves 4.5/5 stars but Yelp doesn't allow .5 stars.

Just a side note, the restaurant is small so the wait is going to take a bit. We waited about 90 minutes and would wait again for it. However, we went to dinner at primetime (7 pm). If you don't want to wait, I was told to go at the opening in the afternoon or for an earlier dinner (less wait)."

542,22,Giacomo's,4 star rating,12/8/2020,"As someone who never craves Italian food or pasta, their food is absolutely delicious. I heard SO much about Giacomo's from Bostoners so decided to give it a try. I ordered their Frutti di Mare in their fra diavolo sauce, Lobster Ravioli, and Goat cheese gnocchi (on their special menu) the two times I have been here. 

Their seafood is incredibly fresh and their portions are massive! I am SUPER picky about the texture of pasta but found it to be perfectly cooked. The flavors were so RICH, and there was just enough seasoning to give it a little kick instead of your generic marinara sauce. Also love that they didn't skimp out on the seafood in the Frutti di Mare - it was loaded with scallops, mussels, shrimp, squid, and clams.  Given how big the plates are, I could have comfortably shared one of their pasta dishes and been satisfied. However, there are so many different pasta combinations here, it's hard to share since I want to try it all! I still haven't tried any of their cream-based pasta sauces and would love to come back to try it (with my lactaid of course!!). 

The space is a bit cramped but still very cozy, and it's expected for most restaurants in this area. We didn't have to wait to get seated on a Sunday night, though they were about an hour from closing. I was a bit disappointed by the service however, we tried calling twice to see if there was space for us to dine-in but I got hung up on twice but we decided to drive over and see for ourselves. When we got there, it was super unclear on who to talk to to get a table, and service felt a bit cold but it might just be me... 

Also, CASH ONLY or they take Venmo (they will give you a code to scan). Kinda wish they would offer credit card in this day in age."

We decided to order the shared seafood pasta dish. Holy smokes, it did NOT disappoint. IT was PLENTY of food for the two of us, and the quality of the seafood itself was ON POINT! 

I also loved that the wine/beer was reasonably priced, and the desserts were big enough to share! 

I would 1000% recommend Giacomos!"

545,25,Giacomo's,5 star rating,1/16/2022,Absolutely love the food and atmosphere here. My favorite place in the North End of the ones I've tried thus far.
546,26,Giacomo's,5 star rating,2/1/2021,"NOTE: Giacomo's is still cash only during the pandemic so make sure you have some!!!
Stopped into Giacomo's after an 8 hour train ride into Boston and was in desperate need of food. I was not disappointed! HUGE portions for reasonable price and TONS of seafood in the linguine with calamari and mussels I ordered. 
The people with me ordered a large Caesar (huge portion and was great! I loved the dressing and the croutons and 10$ for a huge one!) and the caprese (again very Big Bang for buck and fresh and delicious.) 
I ordered the linguine with calamari and mussels and scampi sauce (you pick your pasta, the seafood(s) combo you want, and the sauce you want with it so easy to customize!) and it was DELICIOUS! So much calamari and mussels plus the scampi was absolutely delicious. If anything, I almost wish there were more noodles! If you were splitting with someone, you could definitely get a Caesar and one pasta dish and leave satisfied.
We also all tried a different wine and enjoyed them all. I got a Riesling, and my friends for a Pinot noir and a Cabernet Franc.
Overall, a great spot, great portions, great for groups of 4 (that seemed to be the largest table they had right now) and still offering indoor dining! Would recommend if you're looking for a good, hearty pasta dish!"
547,27,Giacomo's,4 star rating,10/5/2021,"Waited about 25 minutes on a Wednesday night and ate on the top patio which was open to the outdoors. Great and fast service. The food was good but not amazing, but solid Italian food. The bonus was $10 huge glasses of wine"
548,28,Giacomo's,5 star rating,1/1/2022,Great food! Great Service! Visiting from San Francisco and have eaten there twice In the last three days!!

550,30,Giacomo's,5 star rating,8/21/2021,"Giacomo's pasta dishes are so delicious - always a generous portion & generous seafood. I love the service here, and I can tell everyone works as a team! Their outdoor area is a plus, and their sangria is delicious! Best pasta in Boston!"
551,31,Giacomo's,5 star rating,9/27/2020,"Among the restaurants I ate in Boston during Labor Day Weekend 2020, Giacomo's in North End definitely ranks on top as one of my favorites! 

We decided to go for an early lunch/brunch on Saturday morning and was delighted by the available outdoor seating. The restaurant was able to space out a fair amount of dining tables on the sidewalk and street just outside the restaurant. Many restaurants during this time have limited seating outside, but Giacomo's has two long rows of seating that start directly outside its entrance, extending outward to the left of the restaurant (facing away from its entrance). We were able to pick our dining table and sit comfortably distanced from all others!

The food was top notch! I still remember how tasty and crunchy their calamari was. The deep fried starter was served along with fried bell peppers and sweet peppers, which are perfect complements to the calamari. The lobster ravioli was simply amazing. The sauce had a perfect amount of creaminess and cheesiness and was a perfect size to share for two!

I was quite impressed by the quickness of service at Giacomo's during this unprecedented time. I highly recommend visiting during weekend lunch hours!"
552,32,Giacomo's,5 star rating,8/7/2021,"Ate here after first going to the Giacomo's in the North End - there was no wait, the food was equally good (if not better), and the portions were significantly larger. The service was also much friendlier and there was much more space to eat. Would very much recommend coming here (especially over the other Giacomo's in the North End).

Quick note: they only take cash (no card!) which was not made clear to us until we got our bill. It wasn't an issue because somebody from our party just ran to an ATM, but something to keep in mind before dining here."
553,33,Giacomo's,5 star rating,2/26/2020,"Great pasta and seafood place! Huge portions and everything we had was delicious. I think the original one is on the North End but judging by the reviews and pictures of both places they look equally as good. 

No wait at 630 on a Wednesday. Got full by 730. The wait staff was really nice and I think the owner/manager greeted us at the door. They brought soft yummy bread right to our table when we sat down which was great since we were starving. And brought waters right away too. 

The dishes are reasonably priced for the amount of food they give. 17 dollars for the linguine and scallop dish I ordered. Probably about 1lb of pasta and 10 scallops! Huge! My boyfriend got the tuna and swordfish fettuccine in a pesto sauce. The pesto sauce was sooo good and creamy. I liked it better than the sauce I had. Which was supposed to be a tomato and lobster cream sauce but it just tasted like tomato sauce. The swordfish (and the tuna- but I really liked the swordfish) was cooked so well and really paired better than I expected with the pesto sauce. 

We were contemplating getting the 65 dollar meal for 2 but that is pretty expensive. We saw it come out and it was like 4 servings. We wouldn't have been able to finish it and to share it with more than 2 they charge you an extra 10 dollars a plate. We got 2 huge delicious dishes for 34 total on their regular menu and that was plenty. 

The Tiramisu for dessert was amazing. The mascarpone cream was light and fluffy and a little cheesy and a lot delicious. Bold coffee flavor and great consistency with the moist cake. I had tiramisu in Italy and this was better!

Cash only too btw. 

Loved our experience here. Next time I am in Boston I will definitely come back again!"
554,34,Giacomo's,4 star rating,5/18/2021,"Okay Italian for okay prices. The portions are huge and you'll most likely bring some leftovers home. The South End location will take reservations for large parties which is nice and now with COVID, they accept Venmo!"
555,35,Giacomo's,5 star rating,1/8/2020,"I came looking for superb Italian food, and that's exactly what I got. From the excellent food to the wonderful service, it's everything a foodie's looking for when trying a new restaurant. 

We waited roughly an hour on a weekday, as to be expected. We were seated at the counter where we had a great view of the kitchen. We ordered the lobster ravioli and chicken parmesan. 

It has a very intimate ambiance. From looking around, customers were having a great time - many knew the employees even. It was a blast to see the Italians joke around, I'd known I came to the right place. 

Our food arrived and I dug into my ravioli. The richness of the sauce with the beautiful texture of pasta and lobster danced on my tongue. It was a little salty, but I'd much prefer it to be a little more than bland. I tried the chicken parmesan and it was fantastic as well. It was so good that I was scraping the marina sauce off the plate with my fork. It took some willpower to not lick the plate clean.

For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu. And the tiramisu alone would deserve this restaurant five stars. It was beautiful. The best tiramisu I've ever had! To this day, I still crave that slice. If I return to Boston, this might be the restaurant I'll visit first."
556,36,Giacomo's,3 star rating,10/10/2021,"There's nothing really special about this place, considering the numerous other Italian options nearby. 
1) It's cash only - why is this still a thing in 2021?
2) There is no sound dampening/acoustic panels in this place. It gets incredibly loud, the four of us were literally yelling at each other throughout the whole dinner. 
3) Food was decent, I wouldn't come back for it. And if you're going to serve bread, at least serve it warm. No one likes cold stale bread. It also doesn't come with any dips (there is a bottle of olive oil on the table but it's not very good)."
557,37,Giacomo's,5 star rating,10/16/2021,"First of all I love the south end. The atmosphere and area is awesome. We were walking and bumped into this restaurant. They took us in right away. We got there at the right time as it got full 15 minutes later.  The service and the food was amazing. Very attentive, friendly and enjoyable. True authentic Italian. The chicken Picatta was delicious, the Cesar salad was creamy with toasted fresh out of the oven Croutons. I highly recommend this restaurant."
558,38,Giacomo's,4 star rating,10/9/2019,"This is a really traditional Italian restaurant specializing in pasta dishes. Note that this place is in fact cash only and unlike their location in North End, you can book a reservation ahead of time!

We had the Lobster Ravioli, Frutti di Mare, and Fettuccine with Salmon and Sun-dried Tomatoes. The portion of raviolis that was given looked to be pretty small compared to other dishes, but it'll definitely fill you up because of how heavy the delicious garlic white sauce is. The Frutti di Mare pasta with Giacomo sauce was very good as well - the seafood had very good flavor and the Fettuccine dish was also very delicious - lots of tomato flavor. Overall, the food was delicious and the portion size was on the perfect-larger size, and the prices for the food was very fair.

Highly recommend this place!!"
559,39,Giacomo's,5 star rating,4/18/2021,Was able to make a reservation from NYC for a 50th celebration dinner. Food was incredible - so delicious and fresh and flavorful! We started out with the antipasto and I had the lobster ravioli which will not disappoint! Our party also had the fettuccine with prosciutto and peas and fettuccini with swordfish and tuna. This place will not disappoint! Deelish!
560,40,Giacomo's,3 star rating,3/30/2021,"Decent red sauce Italian, specializing in seafood. We had fried mozzarella, fried calamari, Linguine with shrimp and scallops with Fracomo sauce, and Linguine with frutti di mare and fracomo sauce. All solid but not mind blowing...would be much better if the pasta was homemade."
561,41,Giacomo's,4 star rating,2/12/2020,"Have been to both Giacomos, this current location in the South End and their main location in the North End. Usually go to the one in the South End as it is more accessible to me, takes reservations, and the wait is a lot shorter (main location you will probably wait on average for 2 hours). Though I would say the North End one is noticeably better and would recommend going to that one at least one.

Onward to the food review. I usually order a plate of Calamari and their signature Frutti Di Mare with the Giacomo sauce. The calamari is delicious and pretty fresh seafood. Though it can be a hit or miss in terms of portion. Sometimes we get a lot, sometimes we get minuscule amounts. The Frutti Di Mare is one of if not the best Italian pasta dish I have had and it has a delicious sauce that goes along with it. It comes with a generous amount of seafood ranging from shrimps, scallops, clams, etc and a good-sized amount of linguine for its price. It is a pretty big portion that you will probably only finish half of it so you can have the rest some other day.

If you are around the Prudential or South End area, I would recommend giving this place a try if you want authentic, high quality Italian food."

565,45,Giacomo's,5 star rating,6/25/2021,"First tip about this place I'd they do not take credit cards so you pay cash or Venmo. 
I went there with my family around 6 pm on a Friday night.  The place was mostly empty so we were worried that it met not be as good as the little Italy location. 
It is not busy like that location at little Italy but the food and service is just as good.  You have option of indoor or outdoors.  
The waiter was as very nice. Menu offers many options. Authentic Italian.  food with options of combination of sauces and create your own pasta. The giacomo sauce is excellent and you can get diavolo spice sauce or combine Giacomo and diavolo sauce called Fracomo which excellent with shrimp and scallops.  The shrimp large size. The chicken parmigiana is amazing with juicy chicken breast and breading crispy on the outside. The tomato sauce tangy. The chicken peppers and onions in tomato cream sauce was amazing with nice combination the yellow and red peppers give it a great sweetness. There are so many other dishes I wanted to try but may be garlic chicken in broccoli it will be on my list near time.  If you liked the Giacomo little Italy location food but do not want the wait, this place will deliver!!"

567,47,Giacomo's,5 star rating,6/10/2019,"***Cash only.
Delicious food + large portion + good price.
Fried calamari was really good - they had some fried pepper in it.
Frutti Di Mare was recommended with the giacomo sauce (house sauce) - lobster base red sauce but creamy. Came with lots sauce so didn't have to end up with dry noodle as we ate, and the sauce is definitely good! Generous amount of seafood as well. 
As their linguini can come with a few different sauces, definitely want to go back and try something other than the giacomo. 
Also like the lobster ravioli which is creamy and rich."
568,48,Giacomo's,4 star rating,8/7/2019,"My family and I are here recently when we were in Boston. It's a small place with seating for about 30 people. There can be a line at the door waiting for tables to leave. The staff clears tables immediately so it's usually a short wait. The waiters are friendly. 

We started with an order of calamari and they brought fresh bread. The breading on the calamari was light but didn't have much seasoning.

My husband had the Eggplant Parmesan with penne and the tomato sauce made with San marzano tomatoes. It was better than other places because is wasn't soggy but he thought there could have been more seasoning in the sauce. He likes things really herby.

My son had lasagna special which was made with beef and sausage. He enjoyed it but could only eat half. That says a lot for a growing teen.

I had the scallops risotto which was cooked very well. I just wish there was more of it. When we walked in a saw someone in the window they had a big bowl of pasta. 

Overall, great experience with linen table clothes. Also they were the only restaurant in the week we were in Boston that served ice in their water! I guess we're spoiled I'm VA."
569,49,Giacomo's,5 star rating,7/20/2021,Stumbled upon this place after shopping all day on Newbury st. My boyfriend came up from Virginia to try lobster for the first time and was not disappointed. Great price for great food.
570,50,Giacomo's,5 star rating,12/19/2020,"Giacomo's, a warm spot on a cold night. We were lucky enough to be seated quickly in the newly renovated upstairs area. The view out the window was straight out of a movie. We were greeted quickly. Deena and the other server worked together to give us the best service. Her recommendation of the cáptese for an appetizer was spot on. The addition of the charred red bell peppers were a nice spin from the traditional style. My lobster ravioli was definitely the star of the entrees, although all dishes were fantastic. 

Y'all are amazing. Keep pushing thru this pandemic. See you next time!"
571,51,Giacomo's,4 star rating,1/1/2022,Very good for the price paid! I got a clam and mussels pasta dish with the Giacomos sauce which was very good and came hot. The bread they gave was a heart crusted Italian not sliced but still very appreciated.
572,52,Giacomo's,5 star rating,5/6/2019,"NOTE: CASH ONLY.  

A little weird to me that I haven't reviewed what is essentially my favorite restaurant in Boston. And yes - I've been to the Giacomo's at the North End as well. But I prefer the one in the South End - taste is similar but the best part? YOU CAN MAKE RESERVATIONS! Whether you get seated right at your reservation or not is a different story, however. That can be a hit or a miss - we've sometimes had to wait an extra 30 minutes even with a reservation. When they get slammed, they really do get slammed. But, nevertheless, this is the place I love taking any visitors to Boston to. 

The food is just AWESOME here. I've never taken anyone here who has not been pleased with it. 

Some of my favorite dishes:
-Butternut Squash Ravioli
-Lobster Ravioli
-Squid Ink Pasta dish (haven't seen it available recently)
-Zuppa Di Pesce w/ Fracomo sauce

There's lots of things on the menu and quite honestly, I don't remember everything I've had here. I've been coming here for YEARS and I've picked out my favorites that I always come back for. But I will say, I've never really had anything here that was bad. I will say that I've never been able to finish the Zuppa Di Pesce here. Whether it's with a group of 6 or 4 or just 2 of us, ordering that dish guarantees you leftovers. 

And yes - you can't stand in the foyer. Yes, it's cold outside, but that's also a fire hazard.  

I believe they also offer valet parking here ($15) - but there's also a nearby garage that offers $10 parking after 5PM that's a short walk away."
573,53,Giacomo's,5 star rating,8/14/2021,"Best best best burrata I've ever had. It a generous portion: came with fresh sliced tomatoes, very fragrant basil, and tons of prosciutto. The moment I poked the burrata with my fork I knew it was going to be a delicious one. Fresh and creamy burrata, tasted like they just made it today. The bread was amazing too. Highly recommended!"
574,54,Giacomo's,5 star rating,2/1/2021,Went here with my girlfriend for date night last night and we got the salmon fettuccine and the tuna and swordfish fettuccine dishes! They had some clear banner barriers between some of the tables and the tables were pretty well spaced. Good service! Good food! Great portions! I'm someone who can EAT and I was pretty satisfied after the meal...my girlfriend finished maybe half of her pasta
575,55,Giacomo's,3 star rating,9/8/2021,Most money I've ever spent on pasta! Their portions were large so I suggest two people could share 1 entree
576,56,Giacomo's,5 star rating,5/15/2020,"Giacomo's is my favorite restaurant in the world. I have had 3 birthday dinners there over the past 7 years. Every time someone visits me in Boston, I take them to Giacomo's. On my last night in Boston, I ordered take-out from Giacomo's (see attached photos). My favorite dishes are:

1) Butternut squash ravioli.

2) Homemade fusilli with fra diavolo sauce and seafood. The amount of seafood they put on the plate is very generous.

Their calamari, garlic bread, and burrata appetizer are also fantastic. Giacomo's has very reasonably priced bottles of wine ($20-25! for the whole bottle!). I will dearly miss Giacomo's when I move.

I will also add that Giacomo's is doing a great job with their takeout service during the coronavirus pandemic. I ordered my food for takeout at a particular time. It was ready when I showed up, and was kept hot under heating lamps. The dishes were nicely garnished, tasted EXACTLY like I remembered when I ordered in a restaurant, and generously-priced/portioned as always. They even packed me bread!"
577,57,Giacomo's,5 star rating,2/27/2021,"Always a great experience at Giacomo's!!! The food is stellar, do not miss out on the Giacomo sauce on whatever pasta dish you get.

578,58,Giacomo's,5 star rating,8/7/2021,"I was looking for a good place for Italian on a Saturday night in Boston, and the reviews pointed me to Giacomo's.  I was originally looking at the Hanover street location but ultimately decided to come here instead (to try to avoid the mass herds of tourists) and it turned out to be a great decision.

It was definitely less crazy than the Little Italy location, but still busy early (around 6pm) on a Saturday evening. Service was great, prices were very reasonable, and the food was amazing. It's also worth mentioning that the food comes out piping hot and fresh quickly, so it's especially helpful when you're dining with kids.

The fried calamari was perfectly fried and tender. The Marinara sauce that it came with was also nice and flavorful.  I had the linguini and claims with scampi sauce and I ate every last thing on my plate. The sauce was flavorful and they did not drown it in cream and came parmesan like a lot of the fake Italian restaurants do.  My wife had the Lobster Ravioli in a light cream sauce and she seemed to enjoy it.

If you like eating at the Olive Garden this is probably not the place for you. But if you like fresh flavorful food this is a wonderful choice for excellent Italian food. This was my first Giacomo's experience and I will definitely be back next time I visit Boston."
579,59,Giacomo's,3 star rating,12/15/2021,"The food was good.  The wait staff wore masks, but they wore them below their nose or below their mouth (only covering their chin), which made me a bit uneasy, especially with highly transmissible Omicron on the rise."

Much more seating available with little to no wait time. Same menu as the famous location over on Hanover. This location definitely let's you ""chill"" vs. rushed service at other location. 

Went with calamari, fried mozz, garlic cheesy bread, chicken parm, pasta - all fantastic. Top notch service great wine pairings as well. Will be back!"

I called upfront told them it was my girlfriend's birthday they never acknowledge it, when I finally asked for dessert with candle they brought tiramisu and charged me for it and didnt even clear the table so put tiramisu on dirty table full of dirty plates full of pasta and empty mussle shells
Seafood pasta was good but lobster was not fresh in the pasta and very very overcooked 
Chicken parmesagna was very good
Service totally sucked"
582,62,Giacomo's,3 star rating,5/31/2019,"This place is a very standard old school red sauce restaurant. The menu is quite limited but offers all Italian classics. The food was very okay, however this place must have a reputation because the line was out the door as it got later in the evening. 

Originally my friend and I were going to share an appetizer and a pasta, but they have a really annoying sharing policy where they charge an extra $10 for splitting a plate. I guess that's part of their ""old school charm."" So instead we ended up splitting two pasta dishes - the frutti di mare linguini and lobster ravioli. Both my friend and I enjoyed the seafood pasta more. We ordered the lobster ravioli with the Giacomo sauce, which is suppose to be their special red sauce mixed with cream, however it came off relatively one note to me. 

I'm sure there are people who enjoy classic style Italian restaurants, however I would much rather go somewhere like Eataly nearby where I can get more interesting dishes without annoying upcharges."

584,64,Giacomo's,5 star rating,3/13/2020,"I've lived in Boston for five years and often passed by Giacomo's (in the North End). However, I never ate there- I always thought of it as a tourist trap. I was severely mistaken!

Giacomo's is my new favorite restaurant- delicious food, huge portions, and super affordable! The only downside is that you'll probably have to wait for a table- but it's worth it.

The complimentary bread was good- pretty standard Italian bread. I had the garlic bread appetizer. It was the same bread as the appetizer, but drenched in garlic oil. I had looked at pictures on Yelp and thought the bread had cheese- sadly it did not. However, it was still definitely worth the $4. 

I ordered the lobster ravioli, based on the reviews. Lobster is my favorite food and I am very picky. The lobster ravioli was the best I've ever had. Eight plump ravioli, stuffed with fresh lobster meat. The sauce was creamy and delicious. Highly recommend!

For desert, I was torn between the chocolate truffle bomb and tiramisu. My friend ordered the chocolate truffle bomb and I tried it. The cake (part of the truffle bomb) was nothing special- standard chocolate cake. I ordered the tiramisu, and am very happy I did! The ladyfingers were soaked in liquor and the cake was super moist. 

Highly recommend!"

The calamari was good, could have been cut up a little more regularly but it was very tasty. I had the tuna and swordfish with pesto cream sauce over linguine, and it was excellent.

I didn't like my salad dressing and was left with a large amount of plain lettuce. The garlic bread was burnt. The Caesar salad had a total of four croutons in it. I also had a problem with the mozzarella sticks. They were lukewarm and had an unpleasant texture. They tasted very bland, even with the red sauce. All in all, I would say that for the price we paid I feel cheated."

The portions are HUGE!! For the price, you cannot neat the portion size and quality. I love real Italian, & Giacomo's was awesome. The only reason I give them 4/5 stars is because the food could have been more flavorful, and the place was super smashed together. We were sitting next to another couple, and had to keep literally sliding our table over for them to go the bathroom. 

You get bread once you order, and it was delicious. The staff was awesome and very knowledgeable. Honestly, we could have probably spilt an entree, due to the size. 

My boyfriend ordered salmon fettuccine, & I had the shrimp language any with Giacomo sauce. 

The manager is very active and very kind. I am satisfied with Giacomo's, and will return."
589,69,Giacomo's,4 star rating,12/25/2019,"DINNER REVIEW

If you don't want to wait in the long lines in the North End for some authentic Italian food, Giacomo's is a great option in the heart of the amazing culinary neighborhood that is the South End.

The restaurant is small but very homey...you will likely be nudged up next to diners at different tables. If you do have to wait, Anchovies next door is a great dive bar.

We went on a Friday at 5:45 so we got seated immediately. We started with the Caesar Salad and Burrata (which was a special) both of which were fresh and tasty. I wouldn't say these are ""must gets"" but they are good.

What I would say is a must get is the pasta (as it should be no surprise, at an Italian restaurant). Per the recommendations of the waiter, I had the frutti di mare with fra diavola sauce. The pasta was chock full of beautiful mussels, clams, oysters, and more and the sauce was perfectly spicy. This sauce...WOW!

Key things to know: It's cash only and they take reservations, but otherwise the wait will be long."
590,70,Giacomo's,5 star rating,9/19/2020,"This is my favorite restaurant in Boston and I was so glad that they opened up (with precautions) during this pandemic. 
Lobster ravioli is a must try."
591,71,Giacomo's,5 star rating,4/20/2021,"On our recent trip to Boston last weekend we decided to spend our last dinner having Italian. Giacomo's was recommended by a friend who was also visiting Boston, and boy, did we make the right decision coming here! We started off with some calamari- tender and crispy served with a delicious marinara. Next we shared a lobster ravioli in garlic cream sauce and a frutti di mare with linguine fra diavolo style. The lobster raviolis had good amounts of lobster and the sauce was rich and decadent but not overwhelmingly so. The frutti di mare was pure perfection with an assortment of fresh seafood and a perfectly seasoned slightly spicy red sauce. To end the night, we tried the chocolate truffle cake. And my oh my was it tasty! One bite of the moist chocolate cake and creamy truffle along with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and we were in heaven. Sigh...Giacomo's made our trip to Boston a very memorable one with every dish that came out that night. The staff was also very friendly and courteous and the small neighborhood feel of this Italian restaurant set just the right tone for the evening. And the plus was if you didn't have cash on hand, you could easily Venmo them as well. Everything was well-thought out. Thank you, Giacomo's for making our visit truly memorable. We will be back for sure on our next visit to Boston!"
592,72,Giacomo's,5 star rating,7/1/2020,Delicious Italian food! The Bolognese tasted like it came from my Italian nana's kitchen. The pappardelle pasta was a special for the night but I would highly suggest it if that's an option. There is  plenty of outdoor seating and the South End location is currently taking reservations- possibly due to COVID. Some street parking available if needed but pretty tough to find parking during peak hours. All in all-  great food and service !

We waited in line outside for about 15 minutes before being seated for a party of two. They gave us a table on the second floor, which was a beautiful indoor/outdoor area. Our waiter was extremely kind and friendly. We started with the mussels with the scampi sauce, which were so, so delicious, and they came with so many (even more than pictured--we had already eaten some). We also ordered the caesar salad, which was a bit too heavily dressed, but still good. The linguine with clams and fracomo sauce was delicious, but just had a lot of sauce and not too many clams. The linguine with shrimp and fra diavolo sauce was fantastic. The service was quick and everyone was super kind--they did feel a bit rushed at times, but they were all very attentive and made our time at Giacomo's memorable."
594,74,Giacomo's,5 star rating,11/24/2019,"Giacomos so good went tonight and no wait!! I'm thanking the weather for that :) I've always had amazing service here and always get the eggplant parm or chicken marsala, you can't go wrong with either dish. The portions are large and the food speaks for itself. Only draw back is I have to drive to Boston, but it's worth it. Go  tomorrow :)"
595,75,Giacomo's,4 star rating,10/25/2019,"Food: 8/10
The calamari was mediocre. Wasn't very hot or crispy, seemed as if it wasn't freshly cooked? Not sure about that. However, pastas on the other hand were absolutely incredible. Perfectly cooked to al dente. Fresh and chewy, favorite place to come for some quality pasta.

Usually a wait so would recommend reserving a seat beforehand or calling to ask prior or try heading over 15-20 mins before they open at 5 pm so you don't have to wait as long.

TIP: $$ CASH ONLY $$
If you forget to bring some, there's an ATM down the street from the restaurant."
596,76,Giacomo's,4 star rating,2/3/2020,"Coworker was raving about this place, so we all decided to come for dinner on a Boston layover. The restaurant was small, but cozy and we were seated right away about an hour after opening on Sunday night. We were served bread with parmesan and olive oil to snack on while we reviewed the menu. I ordered the lobster ravioli, which seemed to be a popular dish. 
The portions here are pretty generous and the prices are fair. I enjoyed my meal and was pretty stuffed by the end. It is cash only, so be sure to have some on hand. The tiramisu looked amazing, so I will definitely have to save some room for that next time."

Awesome Service! The staff was all super great! 

Great Decor/Atmosphere! Cozy and happy feel and a great wooden street front of the building! 

Outstanding Food! The broccoli appetizer was much tastier than one would expect. Our neighboring table recommended it and it was tasty! 

Clam and Mussel Pesto Linguine was great! Good portion and fresh! 

We even talking to some other friendly guests and it was a great night! 

Happy Times at this place!

Cash only (venmo too since COVID) and south end location takes reservations which is key (call for rez). The fra diavolo sauce is great, awesome shellfish, amazing chicken parm. Also house giacomos sauce is great, and you can mix it with fra diavolo for what they call fra-como sauce (not on the menu)"
601,81,Giacomo's,2 star rating,8/30/2018,"Not sure why this restaurant has such high reviews. I found it just okay.

Visiting from Canada and went in on a Saturday evening. It was packed but luckily no real wait for next table. I think we waited like 5 minutes and were seated quickly. We were next to this local couple who mentioned this place is one of their favourites. Honestly, I am surprised it is. Given they mentioned sauce was a bit watery for one of their dishes when its suppose to be thicker.

I had a really abrasive server who gave me a bad impression that continued till the end of my evening. He wanted to give me the specials but would not say them while my friend was in the washroom. I said I could relay it to her but he would not talk to me until they were back. He also would offer to refill bread but never came to give it to us. At the end of our meal, as we were trying to pay with a tip for him he said no coins. Only bills. That topped it for me. I accept that it's a cash only place but to only do bills? Sorry but my tip reflected what I thought of that and his behaviour throughout my dining experience. 

Besides service, the food was subpar as well. I ordered the lobster ravioli. The filling was a dry lobster paste consistency and sauce was too watery. My friend had the mussel linguine and we both noticed the mussels were tiny. Like size of your thumb. I wasnt wowed by either dish. 

Overall, I would not recommend this place."
602,82,Giacomo's,5 star rating,5/2/2021,I'm so glad my boyfriend and I stumbled across this! Food was delicious and our server was very friendly. Service was quick and the place is CASH ONLY. I definitely do recommending coming here!
603,83,Giacomo's,5 star rating,8/31/2019,"It's a legit italian restaurant. Pasta was al dente, sauce was very flavorful and tons of fresh seafood. 

Here's the down of the restaurant:
1) LOUD place. Def not first date place. This is more ""let's talk over each other"" hang out place. 
2) Very rude bus staff. 
3) $10 plate charge for Zuppa di
pesce if you share this with more than 2 people.  There were 4 of us and we wanted to share this dish. Was told that it's not really more food, it's plate charge. I told
our waiter that we will order another dish. So, we
Shld not be subjected to the plate charge for the other 2. But, she said she cannot do that? Hmmmmm
4. Made reservation for 8pm, but we did not get our table till 845pm"
604,84,Giacomo's,5 star rating,11/17/2019,"Been to both locations and a big fan of both. The best thing about this one is that they take reservations. Just a heads up we did have to wait 20 minutes after our reservation to get seated. Their bread is delicious and got calamari as an appetizer to share. It was delicious. I got the lobster ravioli as my entree and it was stellar as always. The thing I love about Giacomos is despite the high quality of food, it's so affordable. A must have everytime I'm in Boston."
605,85,Giacomo's,5 star rating,10/3/2021,"We had a fantastic meal at this gem of a restaurant.  I had a fantastic plate of linguine with clams, and my husband had wonderful linguine Frutti di Mare, teeming with scallops, calamari, shrimp, mussels and clams.  We had the white wine, olive oil and garlic sauce (there were four other choices), which was a very rich, tasty broth.  Best pasta and seafood dish outside of Venice, Italy, generous helpings, and VERY reasonably priced.  Family friendly, and casual. We'll be back! (NOTE - cash only.)"

607,87,Giacomo's,4 star rating,10/21/2019,"They take reservations at this location!! And cash only! Definitely try to make a reservation before you go, as it can easily be at least an hour wait to get a table. My favorite here is the butternut squash ravioli, but the most recent time I visited here last Saturday we got the lobster ravioli and the scallops linguini with the fracomo sauce. Their flavors are on point and the fracomo sauce on the scallops linguini was amazing. I was debating between the fra diavolo or giacomo, so just went with fracomo. The fracomo sauce actually has a kick so if you can't do any spicy foods I would favor one of the other non-spicy sauces! Usually they are really good with the texture of the pasta (al dente), but the lobster ravioli this time was a bit too undercooked. If you go with someone to share, I would recommended getting a cream based pasta and a red sauce pasta to share!"
608,88,Giacomo's,1 star rating,9/22/2021,Staff was rude to the customer in front of us. While waiting for us to be seated staff again was rude to the customer. When trying to check in staff kept walking by and didnt acknowledge us. Didnt even take a chance.
609,89,Giacomo's,4 star rating,4/23/2018,"** NOTE: CASH ONLY **

I'm fortunate that this place is down the street from me as the place can get really crazy come dinner time on the weekends.  If you want to have a good shot at walking in to be seated then I would suggest the middle of a weekday!

Service the night we came here was prompt (Tuesday night) and fortunately it wasn't crowded to a point where one would have to shout for the other to hear which can be the case if you come in on a weekend for dinner.  

I went for the lobster ravioli which was quite good.  The sauce was rich and creamy and there was a decent amount of lobster in each ravioli.  The price is also quite reasonable for what you get.  My partner enjoyed her Frutti di Mare as well (though she was disappointed they didn't let her combine the red and white sauce that night).  The Caesar salad and calamari were quite fresh and delicious.  No complaints there!  So far the service and food have been quite consistent for us so we'll keep coming back!  

Do note that unless you have a South End permit residential sticker, parking can be annoying if you don't come early in the evening!"
610,0,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,4/10/2022,"I came here with my friend on a Sunday night for dinner. We got here around 6:30 p.m. and had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. The inside of the restaurant isn't that big, but the servers/kitchen operate efficiently and it looked like people weren't waiting long for their food. 

I ordered the pho dac biet, which was had rice noodles and different cuts of beef in a rich, flavorful broth. My friend ordered the honey chicken, but subbed tofu for the protein. Both of us loved our food. It was filling and tasted wonderful. The soups hit the spot in the colder, drearier months in Boston. 

The inside of the restaurant is cozy; I definitely think it would be a good place for a date. I'm usually pretty skeptical of Newbury Street restaurants, but Beantown Pho exceeded my expectations!"
611,1,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,2/27/2022,"This was my go to place for pho whenever I was on newbury! It's a small cute place right on newbury between all the stores to very convenient.

We visited recently and got the com or grilled pork with rice and the pho dac biet as well as the crispy rolls.

The crispy rolls was crispy and crunchy on the outside but was filled with delicious meat and veggies on the inside. Really like the nuoc mam that it came with.

The rice dish came with veggies, grilled pork and nuoc mam. The grilled pork was super tasty! I loved the flavor and char on it but the portions were small compared to all the veggies that were provided. Wished there was a bit more meat.

As for the pho dac biet that was very flavorful and rich as well. It came with a bunch of different meats and the noodles had a great texture.

Overall a great place for pho!!"
612,2,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,1/11/2022,"I ordered this with a friend after craving some Thai/viet food. The food was pretty good, especially compared to other places in Boston (still not as great as ones in the Bay Area). I would definitely come here again if I ever want Thai/viet food.

Curry Noodle 3/10 - I've been craving this dish for a while now which was why I ordered it. However, I was terribly disappointed. The curry used in this was way too sweet. The first few bites were delicious, but the sweetness made it a bit sickening to eat after a while. I would not recommend this dish.

Coconut Tom Yum Noodle Soup 8.5/10 - Although the curry noodle was disappointed, the coconut Tom yum noodle soup was amazing. I loved the broth as it was perfect blend of sour and sweet. I wish more noodles were given so I could've eaten more :)

Vietnamese Iced Coffee 10/10 - I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Vietnamese coffee. It tasted exactly how I wanted it. The coffee was rich and sweet with an underlying bitterness. It was so addicting to drink!!!"
613,3,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,4/6/2022,This place has very good thai takeout. The vibe inside was weird- I probably should have called ahead to order but I did not. The food was really good. I got a chicken noodle dish. It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was yummy and kept me full for the night! I wish there were more of the crunchy peanut things on it and more sauce.
614,4,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,2/26/2022,A New England winter snow storm and an exhausting work week are sufficient reasons to order UberEats on a Friday night. My sister ordered the Spicy Hofun Noodles and I ordered the Tom Yum Pad Thai. Both dishes were absolutely delectable! We made sure to tip extra since our UberEats driver had to travel in inclement weather conditions. The only downside was that with all the additional fees + tip this meal ended up costing about $60.
615,5,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,11/9/2021,"For a quick weekday lunch I stopped by Beantown Pho. Most of the establishment's seats looked occupied, and I managed to get one of the few remaining. One QR code scan to reveal the menu, an order with the waitress, and 5 minutes later, I received my order.

My lunch, the Mi Hoanh Thanh ($12), consisted of yellow egg noodles, pork and shrimp dumpling, fried shallots, sesame oil, and chicken broth. The dumplings tasted extra juicy and fresh. The egg noodles seemed mass-market, and the chicken broth seemed a bit too light, relying too heavily on the shallots and sesame oil.

Overall, this seemed like a fast, no-frills work lunch."
616,6,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,7/29/2021,"i was rec'd this place by a friend after i made it known that i was going through a pad thai phase. i've been here a few times now and the pad thai did not disappoint. i've even branched out to try the pad see ew and that was also delicious. additionally, i've tried their bubble tea and it's great. i love the cups that it comes in with the handle. i've since rec'd this place to other friends and out of town visitors and they all love it

one of the things that consistently amazes me about this place is how the staff is so adept at memorizing your orders. i usually come with 2 or 3 other people and their orders aren't as easy as mine. and then add in drinks. after everyone states their orders, the staff repeats everyone's orders back to you, perfect each time

the food comes out steaming and in large bowls (which sometimes makes the food quantity appear small, but it isn't). i love the pad thai and pad see ew so much and always get those but perhaps i'll branch out in the future too and try out their pho"
617,7,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,11/30/2021,"Came here during lunch. Convenient, but not my favorite pho --noodles could be a little more soft and broth a little more beef-y. Beantown definitely still hits the pho spot though if no place else is open!"
618,8,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,2/27/2021,"We got the pad see yew, honey chicken, samosas, and crab rangoons.

The pad see yew was a little too salty and maybe could have had more flavor/more sweetness, but otherwise was very enjoyable. 

The honey chicken was so darn fried I felt like my stomach would hate me later, but it tasted oh so amazing. It came with steamed broccoli so at least I felt a little healthier.

The samosas were pretty standard, in a cute mini size with a decent spicy kick. My only complaint was that the sweet and sour sauce they came with did not work well. I think they would have been better complemented by a yogurt and dill sauce maybe.

The crab rangoons came free with our order on Uber Eats! They were smaller than normal rangoons, but just as delicious. My fiancé didn't like the lack of dough/crispness, but I thought the ratio of dough to filling was perfect.

Probably won't be coming here too often because we're trying to be healthy, but this will definitely be a go-to for comfort food.Crab Rangoon"

620,10,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,12/20/2021,"i really wanted to convince myself that i had a great meal here, but i would probably be lying. although every aspect of our experience was good, the dish i ordered ended up being quite lackluster.
-you can order for pickup online or dine in. it doesn't seem like they had any outdoor dining tables outside at the time, but the inside of the restaurant has about 15 medium-sized tables. i'm not sure if they take reservations, but you could probably call to ask. we came relatively early at around 5:00 pm, so we got seated right away. however, it can get quite crowded during peak meal hours.
-the service here was pretty good and nothing to complain about. our waitress was really friendly and attentive, and our food took no more than 15 minutes to come out. 
-since we paid in cash, i'm not sure if they accept card payments. 

11/13/21
-pad thai with chicken: this was the only dish that i ordered, and i was unfortunately quite disappointed in it. i'm a huge fan of pad thai and have had it from many different restaurants in the past, but the one here just had a strange taste to it. the sauce didn't really taste like peanuts, but more like vinegar? i'm not really sure why, but it made the noodles' flavor very off. the ground peanuts, egg, bean sprouts, and scallions inside didn't really make it any better. not to mention, the chicken was pretty bland and its texture resembled rubber; i'm not sure if it was undercooked or something. although the overall portion was generous, it still wasn't worth the $12 before tax. (3/5)

overall, i would be open to coming back to beantown in the future, but probably to try some of their other dishes. perhaps i just came by on an off day, but i just didn't feel like my meal was that great. while i wouldn't necessarily recommend their pad thai, my friend really enjoyed the pho that she got for takeout!"
621,11,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,11/8/2021,"This has become one of my go-to spots for Vietnamese and Thai cuisine. Fresh limeade and Thai iced tea are very delicious and consistently tasty!  The beef skewers is a nice appetizer. I had their chicken skewers and that was pretty good too since it came with peanut sauce to pair with it. Their pho ga (chicken noodle soup) is definitely a popular entree! And I enjoyed how they snip up and break down into easier to eat crispy noodles so it's not a big chunk. They were able to make crispy noodle with crispy chicken! Great customer service, too!"

I asked her if they had paper plates, which they didn't as expected but she gave me some takeout covers which work great as make-do plates and plastic utensils. We had the panang curry chicken and the pad kraw pow. Both were delicious and had just the right amount of spiciness.  Nothing like rice with Thai food to hit the spot."

I ordered the Pho Ga, it had a nice veggie broth, shredded chicken, bean sprouts, rice noodles, scallions cilantro, basil and comes with a fresh lime wedge. I really enjoyed it. I personally love Pho, so I've eaten it at several places over the years and this was one of my favorites. One member of my group had the Chicken Pad Thai and also really enjoyed it, another had the drunken noodles  He eats Thai food quite often and he said it was the best he had ever had.  Also the iced tea beverages were very good. I loved the plain unsweetened green iced tea, and also tried the lime aid lemonade. It was a tad sour but was still really good.

I usually like to go to dorchester, Pho Le, for my quick fix but wanted to try to see if other pho places in boston would be able to match the food. I ordered the bo kho and when it arrived to the table, it looked pretty good just from its appearance. At first, it tasted not too bad at all and I didn't have anything bad to say , however, as I kept eating my noodles, it tasted quite sweet, like overly sweet. It was just too much flavor in the soup that made it kinda not drinkable. The staff were very nice which was a good thing and made sure that everyone who wanted to dine here showed proof of vaccinations in order to eat here. But I think food wise, at least with the bo kho, it was just a like a sugary beef noodle broth, and it was a little odd to me because normally there is no sugary taste whenever I have bo kho? Like I don't mind sweeetness from the carrots but it was just a bit too much flavor that I was not looking for."

Also ordered pad thai with crispy chicken, the crispy chicken was so delicious but the noodles could have used more fried egg mixed in. Drunken noodles were also ordered, it wasn't too spicy but all the main ingredients and flavor was par. I'd definitely go again !"

Once we were seated our server took our drink orders.  and since we were already hungry from walking around Newbury we gave our food orders a well.   We ordered the Crispy Chicken Fried Rice, and the Bo Sate Pho Soup. We also decided to try the Taro and Mango Boba Smoothies. 

The Crispy Chicken Fried Rice Dinner order was a decent size and filling. The Bo Sate Pho soup came steaming hot so we had to let it cool for a little. The soup had a Spicy/Sour flavor with a good amount of beef and noodles.  The Sliced Tomato and Cucumbers complimented the soup nicely. 

Our picks for the night we're the Boba smoothies. The sweet and fruity Mango Smoothie won over the Taro."

A friend and I stopped by for dinner the other night and had a great time. I got my usual Avocado Smoothie and Grilled Shrimp Vermicelli Bowl. My friend and I usually split an Avocado Smoothie but a few sips in, we were both overwhelmed with happiness and realized that we each needed our own. It tasted so fresh and avocado like and wasn't too overpowering on the sweetness level. So delicious!!! The Grilled Shrimp Vermicelli Bowl was good, but probably could have used more vermicelli in it! For the first time ever, I felt like I had way too much topping and not enough noodle. I suppose some would say that that's a way better deal, but I really just needed a bit more vermicelli and then the ratios would've been perfect.

Service was fast and efficient. Not the friendliest, but not rude or too pushy either. Would absolutely come back after a day of shopping in the area, or just because I'm craving Avocado Smoothie."

I'm not a fan of Newbury Street for eats in general because most joints are overpriced and bougie, so I am grateful for Beantown Pho.

It's a cozy little spot that's easy to miss, serving up apps, pho, rice, noodles, and bubble tea. 

The pho is a bit untraditional, but I like their pho sate dish quite a lot because it actually has a nice kick to it. You can get pho or egg noodles, so I always appreciate that option as a noodle fanatic. 

I've had a couple of their fried rice and noodle dishes and found them to be quite mediocre. I think their sauces are a bit too sweet and that easily overwhelms the taste of the noodles, protein, and veggies.

Prices are fair, though the portions seem smaller than that of other restaurants. But as I said, I can't complain about these prices on Newbury Street!"

I can never decide between Thai and Vietnamese so here I got the best of both worlds. Service was quick and the food was delicious. Also, reasonable prices, $11 for each of our entrees. I highly recommend what we ordered: the Tom Yum coconut soup and Pad See Ew."
646,36,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,2/4/2020,A traditional ppl restaurant with  quick service. Their dumplings were good but the sauce was far too sweet.  The pho dac viet was perfect - the broth was excellent even if the size of the portion was on the small size. The pho ga was like the best chicken soup with aromatics. The location in newbury st Is super convenient and pho is such a warming soup for these cold winter days!
647,37,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,3/1/2020,"It took me a bit to find the place but I definitely smelled the food fragrance from the street so follow your nose :) The place is downstair so at the street level, you gonna have to look down a bit.
The food is yummy. Service is fast and the waitresses are friendly. I ordered Ice Vietnamese Coffee, Spring Rolls, and Canh Chua Noodle soup with yellow noodles. They are delicious. The coffee is great. It was not overly sweet, which I love.
Their menu has quite a selection. Pricing is great, won't burn hole in your wallet. I would definitely call this place a neighborhood restaurant rather than a tourist place. I would come back again for food."
648,38,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,4/26/2020,"Just discovered this place recently and the food was amazing. I hope they are consistent in the quality of their food, it's was my first time.

We tried the fresh shrimp roll. It was very good but I thought was too little. It was more on the skinny side compare to other fresh rolls. Their peanut sauce was really good.

Panang curry with chicken was tasty but I had better at other places in the city. 

Their pad see eww was really good prepared the way I requested using the correct brocoli (Chinese broccoli) as it should be. Was very tasty. I have only three criticism to make it perfect. I wish the noodles were wider, chard or brown more from the wok and wish all the chicken was tender. I felt that some of the chicken was over cooked.

Pho Ga soup was amazing and perfect that's why I have this place 5 stars.

Service was amazing, they are very nice and the place is clean.

The one negative thing is their location. It is hard to find and parking is a nightmare.

I wrote this review a year or more again for some reason it was never posted. We have to this place multiple times since then and it has always been very good. Will definitely go there again."

651,41,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,1/2/2019,"I work right around Copley so this is my go to lunch place for pho. They have the cutest spot on Newbury that's partly underground. On nice days they open up the patio so you can eat outside and watch the people walking by, which I also highly recommend.

Okay, let's get to the food! The only thing I ever get here is pho and thai iced tea. Thai iced tea is always good. I always get the pho tai and my boyfriend always gets the pho dac biet. Always superb. The broth is something that we always crave on cold rainy days and it's a great price for Newbury.

This cute spot has really nice ambiance. They don't have that many seats, but whenever I go for lunch, they are quick about serving us and the staff are always super friendly. My boyfriend likes his pho really spicy, so we brought a ghost pepper hot sauce once and they came over and asked my boyfriend if it was spicy. They asked if they could try some and took it to the back. Then the waitresses all came out confirming that indeed it was super spicy. 

I usually try to avoid the lunch rush by going at 11:30 or after 12:30 and I rarely have to wait. They also play the best music. I think I'd call it 'alternative modern pop'. I often make my boyfriend read the spotify playlist they have playing on the plugged-in phone so I can listen to it at home.
 
Overall, very cute place. Not the best pho I've ever had, but the people, presentation, and the feel of the place really makes this place special."
652,42,Beantown Pho & Grill,2 star rating,6/23/2021,"Two stars only for the gyoza. It was soft and tasted good even though it was delivered, but the entree was horrible. The chicken basil was supposed to be batter fried (the batter kept falling off) but most importantly, how do you over cook chicken so much that it's hard to chew? I understand delivered food suffers a little on quality and freshness but this was abysmal."
653,43,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,6/2/2020,"I came in for a quick snack and got the vermicelli noodle bowl with shrimp. The meal felt very clean and healthy, despite what I'm used to from traditional Vietnamese restaurants which could feel a bit heavy on the stomach. Loved the noodles but the shrimp was hard to peel for me maybe because I am clumsy. I got the egg roll for an extra $1 and it was delish. Definite great on the go food."
654,44,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,9/25/2019,"Delicious pho spot on Newbury! 

Consistently good pho, tasty wontons and friendly staff.

656,46,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,1/23/2021,Not the easiest place to find as the entrance is below ground level. It's great for a quick lunch. Decent pho!
657,47,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,8/13/2021,"Loved their tom-yum pad thai and beef skewers. However, the taste is not consistent. There were times when the pho was so bland or the pad thai was lacking seasoning."
658,48,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,5/16/2019,"TLDR: solid pho in back bay. 

You want pho, this place does a decent job. They are a little lacking on pho types (no beef balls) but it's a decent bowl. Also plenty of Thai food I haven't tried yet."
659,49,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,7/18/2021,"Fantastic casual dive with an extensive and creative menu, great flavors and the cheapest meal on newbury street!"
660,50,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,1/12/2019,"I had Beantown Pho with pork. It was pretty good. 
I think that this is not a real authentic Vietnamese restaurant, more like Asian fusion restaurant. From my experience in San Jose little Saigon area (been to lots of Vietnamese places), the soup is kind of different from real Vietnamese. Despite that, the soup was differently good, especially marinated pork was tasty."
661,51,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,12/20/2020,Love the home made tasting food and the nice people who work there. Very nice neighborhood restaurant that I'd highly recommend.
662,52,Beantown Pho & Grill,1 star rating,6/1/2021,"The food was flavorless. I also ordered the Pad Thai with no nuts ( said that twice in the order). They put nuts in my food, then had the audacity to argue with me about the request for nuts. It was very unprofessional and concerning. The lady that answers the phone had bad business practices. I will never go back. Thai Basil is a better restaurant."
663,53,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,1/26/2018,"This is my new favorite restaurant in Back Bay. After ordering takeout from here a few times (and being perfectly satisfied), a group of 3 of us made it in here one chilly Thursday night. We had originally tried to go to the ramen place down the street, but there was a huge line outside in the freezing cold..meanwhile, Beantown Pho & Grill was right down the street with delicious food and warm pho...with no wait!!! I hope people don't find out about how good this place is or else it'll get crowded. 

The menu has a huge variety of various Thai + Pho dishes, as well as dessert and drinks. Not sure if anything is authentic, but the diversity of the menu was enough to draw me in. The spicy calamari is the BEST appetizer you can get! Calamari was cooked perfectly, and I couldn't get enough of the flavor. The pho was quite delicious too; while not the huge steaming bowls I was used to in Philly, it's probably a healthy-sized portion with enough meat to satisfy. 

Finally, I was a big fan of the bubble tea (bubbles are very chewy) and service! Will be my go-to place to eat if looking for an easy meal when I don't cook."
664,54,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,4/3/2019,"Found it looking for a quick bite and even tho it's busy it is fast, and he prices are fair especially for this neighborhood.
The octopus appetizer was gone in about five seconds after it hit the table, and the main dishes came out in less than ten.
Honey chicken is crispy and delicious, the chau chau, if you ask for extra spicy, it WILL be extra spicy! Wow! Love it. It's so hard to find a good noodle shop!
Everything about the place feels fresh and on point. Lovin' it."
665,55,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,3/19/2019,"Maybe three stars is more accurate than the enthusiastic four stars I initially suggested?

I've now been three times.  The first visit with Pad Kra Praw was the best, followed by today's Spicy Chicken Gochujang, which had enough jalapenos to make my tongue sweat (not a complaint).  The middle trip with the Thai Red Curry was a little meager and lackluster, but to each their own.

One unfortunate experience that impacted the star rating is that on the middle trip, I brought a friend who hadn't been there before, and he asked if he could substitute extra veggies in lieu of rice, even if there were an extra charge.  They refused, which surprised us both.

I doubt that he'll return, which I understand.  That's disappointing because I would easily have invited other local colleagues to try it with me if it weren't for that."

667,57,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,2/15/2020,Ordered the crispy pad Thai and gyoza and both were tasty. Will certainly try this place again.
668,58,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,6/18/2019,"This place has great take-out pho. If you request something, they usually won't do it, extra sauce/lime for example. 
I have eaten here a lot, some things can improve.. like the Papaya salad, they don't seem to clean the shrimp as well as they could. If they could fix little things like that I'd definitely rate better. 
Great customer service otherwise!"
669,59,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,11/25/2020,By far the best Thai food and Pho is Boston. Came here for my bday last year with friends and orders a massive spread of food- everything was great!
670,60,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,3/26/2021,"quaint and underrated spot on newbury! the menu was extensive and had so many good sounding options that you don't casually find at other restaurants. i had a bun salad which was fantastic, will definitely be heading back here soon"
671,61,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,9/17/2018,"Perfect if you're a lone diner. Customer service is great, the restaurant is super clean. Come during lunch because of the lunch pricing. 

The only issue I had was that my Drunken Noodles with shrimp was very bland. I also only got like...3 shrimp that costed extra. Food is okay but nothing crazy. I would come again during lunch and try something else."
672,62,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,11/9/2019,"One of my favorite lunch spots around Back Bay. It's located in a cool little basement spot with a nice vibe. Minimal seating options so sometimes there's a little wait.

The food is great, good portions and fair prices. It also comes out fairly quick, so great for lunches during work days."
673,63,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,8/13/2018,"Take my review with a grain of salt, as I didn't get any pho. Perhaps the pho is their best item, but I was craving some simple pad thai and crab rangoon, so I can only rate those dishes.

The crab rangoons are possibly my favorite that I've found in the city in the 3 years we've lived here. Great balance of crispy wonton and the right amount of filling. I would definitely get these again!

Unfortunately, the pad thai was really bland. I know it's not traditionally a spicy dish, but there was zero spice, very little sweetness or sourness. Just the most flat-flavored dish I've had in a while, and the chicken was really overcooked. That said, it wasn't the worst pad thai I've had, but it just lacked interest. I would possibly try it again, but I'd try to ask for some spice and hope that was enough to bring the dish to life.

Otherwise, the space is really cozy and cleaner than many of the restaurants that I've been to in the garden level of buildings in Back Bay. There's also a nice, small outdoor patio. With the really pleasant staff, it's a relatively safe bet for a decent meal. I just wouldn't recommend the pad thai."
674,64,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,10/23/2020,This is my local favorite Thai place. The soups with coconut base are yummy. My go to is drunken noodles and Thai basil fried rice.
675,65,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,6/22/2018,"So you want some Pho? You want some fresh veggies? Quick service? Actually tender protein and whole meatballs? I have found your ""other"" Pho restaurant in the Back Bay Area of Boston... I only waited for my Pho like 10min, if even that long... The five spice broth was really super tasty and actually better than another Pho restaurant I visited prior... These are all of my upsides...

Now the down side... only one size bowl on the Pho so come hungry or you are leaving food on the table... The protein was a little on low side in quantity but see above about the meatball... and I had some gristle... I always have the tenderloin and meatball... veggies were fresh and crunchy but mostly bean sprouts, some cilantro and lime wedges... so if you missing some jalapeño or anything else you may have to ask... They may have been having a slow night but I only saw a few tables come and go while I was there... 

I normally only rate a restaurant after I have been there at least twice but as this was a business trip and it was delicious, I had to post... 

By-the-by, I was at another Pho restaurant the prior night, they are neck and neck..."
676,66,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,8/30/2018,"I've eaten here at least 2 dozen times. Food is consistent, service is friendly. Lunch special updated set is a good value for $2 extra. Great pho, fresh rolls and sa ot."
677,67,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,7/27/2020,"Order the fried chicken wings and pho dac biet. 

Chicken wings were juicy and crispy. I think they battered the chicken lightly with flour before frying. Would order again. 

Pho was ok. The broth had a strong cinnamon and star anise flavor but could have been beefier. 

Everything was packaged nicely and employees were wearing masks and gloves when I went to pick up. 

Would def order again from here!"
678,68,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,4/28/2018,"I've ordered from Beantown Pho & Grill twice now! I usually get the crab rangoon, pad thai, and of course, a Thai iced tea. I've heard great things about Beantown, and it always seems packed when I go to pick up my order. 

The crab rangoons are uniquely shaped, but don't worry, they taste scrumptious! Crispy on top, filled with warm cream cheese and crab that bursts in mouthfuls. 

The pad thai was wonderful. Umai is usually my go to for take out in the area, and I think Beantown just supplanted it!"
679,69,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,2/18/2020,"Ordered delivery on Sunday night, took about 45 minutes via Uber Eats. Food still arrived hot and in good condition, we were excited for the meal! 

Like most Chinese / Japanese restaurants, I got chicken fried rice. Overall, taste was good although the size of carrots and broccoli were a little too large for my liking. Additionally, the quantity was slightly lacking as I was still hungry after eating the entire meal. 

Really not too much else to say, given I don't enjoy the cuisine too much but one of the better Restaurants in Boston I've tried. 

Disappointed with no fortune cookie or tiny cracker sticks. Love those at these types of places! 

Overall, 4/5 and likely more of a 3.5/5 if I was able to give half stars. Would order again, but not necessarily my go to."
680,70,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,10/3/2019,"So delicious after a long day! Had the tofu and veggie soup followed by the beef pad see ew.  Spot on and fresh.  Staff is pleasant.  Looks a bit shady from the outside but just trust me and go down the twisty stairs, tasty treats await."
681,71,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,6/12/2018,"Awesome little place to grab fairly affordable lunch on Newbury Street. We sat outside on the patio, which was great since the weather was sunny and the live band across the street was playing music. The service is great with our waiter checking in with us and always making sure our water glasses were filled. I wanted to try their pho, but it was a little hot, so I opted to try the cold vermicelli noodles with shrimp. The waiter did mention the shrimp isn't peeled, so I just had to peel it all before I mixed everything together to eat. The sauce is very faint and light, I wished it was a little more flavorful to add to the dish. The noodles were great, not bunched up or anything and the vegetables added a nice crunch to the dish. I'll definitely be back to try the pho and the mango sticky rice next time!"
682,72,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,8/17/2019,Good food in the heart of beantown. Was staying in the hotel across the street. Called in an order over the phone from the room. By the time I walked over it was ready.
683,73,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,9/28/2019,"Delicious food!!!   We had the Pad Thai, wonton soup, Vietnamese fried rice, and a Thai iced tea.   All so tasty and so reasonably priced!

Small spot but cute.  Great location."
684,74,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,3/31/2018,"I've been meaning to try this place since the reviews are good, and stopped in on a Saturday night around 7pm. The place was pretty full but we got seated for 2 immediately.

They have a wide menu, but the drinks also look interesting. There is a chalkboard menu above the counter to check out. The interior is cozy and comfortable, not too loud.

We ordered the pho dac biet and the mi haisan. Both were delicious and the portions are a good size. I had the mi haisan, and I liked the clear, light broth with the nutty flavor of the sesame oil. The basil and sprouts on the side were fresh. I also got the jasmine limeade, which was delicious! The first one I've tried where you actually get a hint of the floral jasmine flavor. Service was fast and friendly, and prices are decent.

I'll be back here for sure whenever I need my pho fix in Back Bay."
685,75,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,9/18/2017,"At first glance, this place seemed teeny tiny. There were maybe 4 or 5 outdoor tables and most of those were 2 seaters.  If you look closer, there is a relatively spacious indoor seating downstairs also. It is basement seating and probably a little stuffy in the summer. 

The food is authentic and probably considered good by Boston standards but we've  had much better Vietnamese food in NJ and PA. The portion size is smaller than what we are used to. I ordered the beef with vermicelli entree. The beef is not the standard thin, barbecue marinated slices that I usually get. These were sliced chunks more akin to a Chinese style dish. 

We waited for an outdoor table and it was well worth the wait. People watching on the busy Newbury St made for a great atmosphere."
686,76,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,4/2/2018,"My friend and I went here for a late night bite in the city. We have had Pho' before but when we saw on the menu, a Sweet and Sour Pho' we were like what?! 

So naturally we decided to order that with no expectations of how it may taste. After my first bite I was pleasantly surprised, it was delicious! Needless to say we both finished our bowls and I can confidently say I'd certainly go back again!"
687,77,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,5/23/2019,3.5 rating. Great for a quick bite during lunch. Decent portions and good lunch deals.
688,78,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,1/6/2019,"What do you do when hungover in a new city? 

Find the closest bowl of pho. 

I've been spoiled by Los Angeles for sure but unfortunately the pho at beantown pho and grill left me wanting more. First of all, they only had pho dac biet, pho tai, and pho ga. Where are my combinations? Pho chin nam? Pho chay? Plus there was a lot of Thai food on the menu. Not bad but not what I expected from a place that had pho in its name. 

The broth itself is aromatic but wasn't beefy at all. I like a balance between the two flavors. They gave 5 chewy beef pieces. Huge portion of noodles and broth though!

Probably a combination of the area I was in and my expectations. Perspective from someone who has lived in Atlanta and Los Angeles and has become accustomed to authentic pho."
689,79,Beantown Pho & Grill,3 star rating,5/8/2018,"Came after 5PM on a Monday and the restaurant had plenty of seating. There are tables both inside and outside. 
The pho here is served in a light, fragrant broth. The broth smells quite strongly of star anise, so may not be for anyone irritated by strong smells. The broth does not have the depth of flavor that some other Vietnamese shops offer, but it's quite good value relative to Boston prices. 

Service was rather slow, we waited 30 minutes before a server came despite the restaurant being quite empty."
690,80,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,12/5/2017,"If you are craving something hot and soupy after a long day of shopping on Newbury street on a cold winter's day, this is the place for you!

While I have walked along Newbury street dozens of times, I have never noticed this restaurant until I discovered it on yelp. I am so happy to discover it because the food is good and affordable! 

This place offers a mix of Thai and Vietnamese cuisine with a pretty typical selection of dishes. The husband and I opted to try the duck noodle soup and coconut tom yum noodles. The duck noodle soup was served with a generous amount of sliced duck, thin yellow noodles and the broth was quite sweet with subtle flavors of five spice. The tom yum noodles were not as spicy as I hoped they would be, but nevertheless, it had a good broth and quite generous amount of chicken and shrimp. It was served with flat rice noodles, and if I had to be picky, the noodles were a slightly overcooked and were broken in tiny pieces.

The wait time was surprisingly only 10 minutes when we arrived at 6.30 in a Saturday, but the line got longer and longer as it got later. So come slightly earlier if you want to avoid the wait!

The prices of the dishes were extremely reasonable and affordable especially since this is Newbury street we are talking about! For two people, our bill was less than/around 25 dollars including tip. 

The service was efficient and minimal, don't expect small talk.

Overall, I am really glad to have found this place. While I would not commute here just to eat at this restaurant, this will definitely be one of the options for me when I am around the area."
691,81,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,4/16/2018,"Visited Beantown twice while in Boston for dinner on a Saturday night and for lunch on a Monday. Sat night we had to wait about 15-20 mins for a table to open up to accommodate our party of five. The restaurant is small as are more restaurants on Newbury but it's cozy and comfortable.

The staff was very nice and patient with us as we made up our minds on our dinner options.

We had the fresh spring rolls, shrimp shumai and the takoyaki for apps- all delicious but the shrimp shumai was def my favorite and worth coming back for alone! 

I ordered their pho dac biet soup which comes with a combo of five different cuts of meat and a delicious broth! It was delicious. 

Next time your on Newbury do yourself a favor and check out Beantown!"
692,82,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,10/5/2019,"Has a small, but nice cozy feel to the restaurant. Service was pretty good along with a great menu to choose from. I ordered Pho and love it. Also there are good vegetarian options for pho too."
693,83,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,9/5/2015,"Came here for a family dinner and enjoyed every minute of it! It was actually a very special laid back dinner. Good ol Yelp helped me select this place and we were extremely happy we dined here! The menu is a mix of a Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, a bit of everything. Our meal was outdoors on the patio as it was a humid summer evening but we wanted to eat and enjoy outside on a nice summer evening. We came here for Thai food and it was awesome. The meal was what you expect from Thai food. Spicy in flavour with some sweet, creamy and salty. Overall exceptional. 

Items ordered:

Thai Iced tea- creamy and with lots of ice. The perfect accompagniant to a spicy meal. 

Fresh spring rolls- crisp lettuce, fresh and delicious as an app. 

Spicy calamari- tender crispy calamari with chopped jalapeño and fried peppers and onion with some chilli seasoning. Outstanding. 

Chicken curry- creamy orange in colour. sweet and exactly how we enjoy it with beans, broccoli and carrots and thinly sliced chicken

Beef drunken noodles- probably the slightest dissapoinment dish as not as sweet and spicy as preferred. But still fragrant and tasty. 

Pad Thai w crispy chicken. - chicken seasoned very light but crispy and delicious. 

Service was attentive and pleasant. A good choice if you are staying in the area. Definitely would return again!"
694,84,Beantown Pho & Grill,4 star rating,11/6/2018,"The food:
I had the pad thai w/ beef. Serving size was decent, and the noodles were delicious. The beef was very moist and the whole dish had a lot of flavor and nuances. It wasn't overly sweet like some other places. Will definitely be back for more!

Service is great. It's packed during dinner time, especially on the weekend."
695,85,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,3/11/2018,First time having real Vietnamese food and I am a new fan. Sweet staff and delicious food. The restaurant itself is a little hard to find which makes it more intimate. Chicken pad Thai and the vegetable rolls tasted fresh and made to order. Highly recommend anything on the menu. Leftovers can be taken home so don't worry about over ordering.
696,86,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,4/17/2019,"Been here multiple times. Very consistent and very good. I used to travel into C-town to get great cost food. But I usually stay in the Back Bay Area and this spot is just so convenient on Newbury. 

They have a great Pho and they have some selections that are ok for someone with gluten free allergy or celiacs. You have to ask the wait staff to be sure because the menu is not 100% clear, but they usually clarify and confirm your concerns. 

If they updated their menu to provide clear guidance and gave celiac patrons a gf menu, that would help a lot. 

Either way 5 stars for the food, location and service."
697,87,Beantown Pho & Grill,5 star rating,2/20/2019,"Oh my! The fuck noodle soup is out of this world.

 Order it now!!!"

Staff was attentive; ambience was very cute and cozy; drinks and food came out very fast; everything was super yummy.
I had the Saigon salad (shrimp and shredded chicken salad) and it was a perfect light meal.
Also all the drinks came in cute glass mason jars which is always a plus.
The one thing I would note is that the bathrooms could use some maintenance... 
But overall a very positive experience and the bill was less than 80$ (before tip) with 5 entrees and 4 drinks!!"

We hit this place up before a show, note the seating area is very small, so we had a little wait, but never fear. There is an awesome harry potter store that may or may not have taken up our time and money while waiting on our table. The wait staff was very nice, and quick with service. I'll definitely be back here the next time i'm in Boston."
700,0,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,4/3/2022,"10/10 would come back to Boston just for Luke's!!!!! 
The 3oz lobster flight was an amazing way to try all the different sauces added. We got the butter flight (truffle butter, hot honey & garlic butter). Each bun was warm and toasted to perfection and the lobster was amazing!!!!! The original lobster roll was also great! stuffed and over flowing with lobster. 
The lobster bisque was served piping hot with chunks of lobster in it. This was my first time having lobster bisque, so I don't have any comparisons but it was good! 
The blueberry lemonade is a Luke's special, it had a nice pucker to it. Personally am not a fan of blueberry but I didn't mind it."
701,1,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,4/9/2022,"Great spot with enjoyable food ! 
New Yorker visiting for a weekend, i automatically would love to try MA crowders and sea food rolls! We googled top in the area and Luke's Lobster was the winner. 
We got the Lukes Trio that comes with mini sea food rolls (lobster, crab and shrimp) and a small soup which we went with Clam Crowder. 
We also got a large of Lobster Bisque and have to admit I've had better."
702,2,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,2/27/2022,"This place was amazing. Only slight negative was how long it took for the food to come out but I think that was mostly due to hanger and all the amazing butter smells in the building lol.

The lobster roll... wow. I seriously haven't tasted anything so amazing. The bun was perfectly toasted, the lobster was so moist and buttery. Also, everything stayed so well together in the bun... how?????? 

Clam chowder, so thick and creamy. 

Definitely check them out if you're in the area."
703,3,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,3/30/2022,"Wow! So yummy and fresh! I had the sandwich trio which included a 2oz lobster, carb, and shrimp roll. They were amazing! You can tell the fish was extremely fresh. My favorites were the lobster and carb. One of the workers recommended I try the spicy hot honey and OMG what a difference. It really gave the sandwiches an extra kick! Highly recommend!"
704,4,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,1/26/2022,"We had no clue this was a chain until we arrived. The clam chowder was suburb and the lobster trio was delicious. We also got the shrimp roll which was extremely generous with overflowing shrimp. 

The quality was not what I would have expected for a chain, it was just as great as some of the top line restaurants we went to in Boston. Definitely recommend.

One con was they don't offer any free water for customers so be sure to buy some water bottles when placing your order."
705,5,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,4/11/2022,Truffle  butter  lobster roll. I love a Maine lobster roll. I'm sooooo glad someone thought to use TRUFFLE butter. This lobster roll was magical and absolutely made my day.
706,6,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/12/2022,"Wow, did not think a little 4 oz meal could blow me away. Yet Luke's did just that. I got the 4 oz lobster roll with a gluten free bun and my husband got the regular 4 oz lobster roll. We were both impressed by the amount of lobster on the rolls- perfect ratios. The flavoring was perfect and the lobster meat was SO fresh. They even have a board they update daily with where the the seafood is sourced from. The lobster when we went was from Maine. 
I will definitely make a point to be back every time I am in Boston."
707,7,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,2/18/2022,"I wanted a seafood place for my last day in Boston and came across Luke's.  It's very clean, sufficient seating and easy to see menus.  You place your order then get your drink and find a seat.  I couldn't decide so I ordered the lobster roll trio which was lobster, crab, and shrimp rolls.  They were delicious!  I don't know which I could say was my favorite and each had a unique taste.  I wish I had been able to try the lobster Mac N cheese, guess I'll need to return."
708,8,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,11/21/2021,"We popped into the place for Sunday lunch

Decided on the trip of lobster rolls and a clam chowder 

I liked the lemon butter the best 
Hubby liked the truffle the best 

But all three were really good 

The let down was the clam chowder, it was good but needed seasoning as badly as Fergie from black eyed peas needs singing lessons. And it felt watered down."
709,9,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,3/25/2022,"This was the perfect place to try my first lobster roll! Served chilled on a toasted roll, the lobster had good flavor with the butter herb marinade. It also comes with a side of more butter as well. I got this to go with a cup of clam chowder and the pickup was so easy and convenient. The inside was very nice and clean as well so there is no problem ordering in too!"
710,10,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,1/23/2022,"Ordered: Lobster Roll, Clam Chowder

The lobster roll was just okay, nothing special. Maybe it would've tasted better if the lobster was more flavorful and the bun was toasted more. The clam chowder was also disappointing. The consistency wasn't thick enough and the flavor was subpar. Overall, wouldn't recommend as there are better places in Boston to get a lobster roll and satisfy your seafood craving."
711,11,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/10/2021,"We're in Boston, we HAD to try a lobster roll.  Fortunately, after a day of touring Boston, we were able to get delivery!! Sweet!

Our whole group ordered 4 oz lobster rolls, 9 of them.  The rolls were on a bun the size of a standard hotdog bun.  Initially, we were underwhelmed with the size but after digging into it, it was plentiful and filling.  It came with melted butter and was well seasoned.  

What an experience! I loved every bite! My first lobster roll did not disappoint!!"
712,12,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/14/2022,The food was incredibly fresh and the service was great.  Don't let the small sandwiches fool you.  They are filling.
713,13,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,9/25/2021,"I think the lobster in this lobster rolls is really fresh! The size of the lobster roll is relatively small, but because it's fresh and yummy, I'd still recommend you to try it out. 

I personally think the lobster rolls from Pauli's (Boston Little Italy) and from here are the best!f"
714,14,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,8/28/2021,"There rolls are a must! The price was super fair and well worth it for the amount you get. The bread is buttered and tasted sooo good. 

The lines are constantly long but it goes by quick. There's both indoor and outdoor seating. 

Lobster roll was $24/4oz and crab roll was $16/4oz."
715,15,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,12/21/2021,"Nothing but awesome things to say about this Lobster joint! Was just a short 4 minute walk away from my family's hotel and was very easy to pop into for a quick bite. It was also my girlfriend's first time trying a lobster roll, she loved it! They did offer the lobster roll to be served New England Style, only Maine style. Nonetheless, still some quality lobster meat! The Clam Chowder was also very good. I recommend the Luke's Trio because you get to try out some great Crab and Shrimp in addition to lobster. Definitely hit this place up for an amazing lobster roll!"
716,16,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,12/6/2021,"Roll was delicious, spicy honey butter was addictive, it does what its supposed to and service was great."
717,17,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,8/26/2021,"Luke's Lobster was delicious! 

There is a 4oz and a 6oz Lobster roll, if you're hungry go for the 6oz. The Shrimp, Crab and Lobster combo was delightful although the rolls are about 2 inches in size so you get enough to taste but leave wanting more. 

Clam chowder was really good too."
718,18,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,8/25/2021,"My family and I wanted a light lunch before exploring Boston and when in Boston, you get a lobster roll. We originally were going to get the Luke's trio with clam chowder to share but the worker was like ""Just one for the 3 of you?"" and told us it was really small. We ended up getting 2 orders to share and good thing we did because those sandwiches would've been the smallest bite to share between 3 of us!

I was the most excited for the lobster but the crab ended up being my favorite! The seafood is fresh and I loved the buttered roll. The clam chowder was hearty and warm and the perfect accompaniment for the rainy weather outside. Probably would get the crab combo if I'm in next time around and I want to try their mac and cheese since it seems to be quite popular."
719,19,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,12/16/2021,"I was very steadfast on trying Luke's Lobster when I visited Boston lol. Now thinking back I really didn't understand why as there were many Luke's Lobster in other states. Anyways the lobster roll was good. The lobster was pretty fresh and retains it's good texture. There were not much sauces nor any veggie in the roll, allowing you to fully appreciate the taste of lobster, which I really liked. The clam chowder was full of ingredients. Taste wise it's better than the ones you would get as complimentary dish in hotel/restaurant but not that much better."
720,20,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,2/20/2022,"A friend suggested this place after a night of drinking (ha!) and my boyfriend and I wanted to indulge in a few more lobster rolls before we head back to Philly. Man, I didn't realize lobster rolls were so pricey! But compared to the lobster rolls we had the night before at a higher end restaurant, these lobster rolls were IT! The buns were toasted perfectly and the lobster tasted great. The roll was FILLED and they didn't skimp on the lobster. I just wish this chain had more of a chain restaurant price list. My friend ordered the clam chowder and said it was pretty decent. I would come again for a quick lunch!"
721,21,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/31/2022,Food is greeeeeaaaaat.  The lobster in the lobster roll is fresh.  The deco is also very cool.
722,22,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,1/22/2022,"The bun... is very good and the lobster is better. Pricy but what roll Isn't. If ur gonna get a decent roll here's the place to do it.

Lobster Roll Clam Chowder"
723,23,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,11/29/2021,My husband and I were doing some Black Friday shopping and wanted a lobster roll. This place did not disappoint! It is a small place and tables fill up! Both of us had the lobster trio. We loved the variety of flavors. Our favorite was the spicy honey. The balance of heat and sweet of the lobster was a perfect marriage. The other two weren't as balanced or flavorful. The lobster corn chowder was tasty too. However it had way too much corn and potatoes and tiny bits of lobster. Overall we loved the take on the traditional lobster roll and it was in a great location!
724,24,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/21/2021,"is it possible that a place is soo good... that you convince yourself to have it twice in one day? Luke's Lobster Back Bay is!! started with a quick soup of the day it was lobster corn bisque, delicious and hit the spot. ... took a quick walk to the gym around the corner and right after for our 2nd visit - went all out, got the lobster trio [ highly recommend it! ] 

I particularly like the chill laid back atmosphere, small and cozy with this ramp that goes on for days if you need to use the bathroom and metallic so everyone will hear ya when you are walking on it... overall great service cool people and delicious delicious new england lobsta rolls!! buttery, soft but crunchy, and tons and tons of meat!! can't wait to visit again!! 

thank you Luke's Lobster Back Bay!! love it all!

725,25,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,11/4/2021,"My favorite lobster roll in Boston! Roll was great, chowder was great, sofa was great! Service is always awesome!"
726,26,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/25/2021,"Juicy, fresh, superb! Luke's trio is an awesome choice if you're undecided and want to try everything Luke's has to offer. The size of the trio comes to about a 6inch roll (and the price, at $20, is comparable to the lobster roll at $18).
But the rolls are AMAZING and they're quite generous with the fillings.
Lobster was definitely a favorite followed closely by the shrimp.
The chowder is also great and satisfying(no pork bits, So it's halal)"
727,27,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,10/14/2021,Simple and good. The lobster was fresh and we really enjoyed our meal!! Good portion sizes and we liked that you have the option to get the 4oz or the 6oz lobster roll. The white truffle butter added a nice flavor and we loved it!
728,28,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,10/11/2021,"Tried the lobster roll and clam chowder while visiting Boston and it did not disappoint. The lobster was so fresh, light, and tender! The roll was the perfect complement to the lobster as it was buttered to perfection. Clam chowder was good as well. 

The only knock I have is the price. Felt it was too small of a portion for the price, but overall I'd still recommend because it was that good."
729,29,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/16/2021,"As a celiac I never thought I would get to eat a lobstah roll ever! This place brought the goods! They have a separate grill for the bread and were so accommodating! They even had a Gluten free chowdah! The lobster was so fresh and I love that it's sustainable. Love everything about this place - It was $80 for two of us to get a roll a soup and a drink. Don't get me wrong-  it was totally worth it- but at these prices it's more of a splurge occasional meal than one I could enjoy more often. Either way- thanks Luke's for having safe celiac friendly options and an outdoor seating area,  I know I really appreciate it!!!"
730,30,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,9/1/2021,My boyfriend and I first meal when we arrived in Boston. It was close by at least 10-15 minutes walking distance. There was no lines when we arrived to Luke's. Best lobster and crab rolls ever! A must try if you are ever in Boston! Decently priced for both rolls.
731,31,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,9/26/2021,"The place is a bit out of the way in Back Bay and I never would have run across it if I wasn't looking for some seafood places I hadn't tried. It's a really small space with not a lot of seating so I ended up getting my food to go and food a nice spot to sit along Boylston to do my taste testing. All three were great, but I do think my favorite is still the crab roll.  The rolls all tasted really fresh with just the right amount of butter on the bread and seafood so nothing was drowning but had a great flavor."
732,32,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,9/3/2021,"It wasn't the best lobster roll I had. Felt like I was eating butter bread like for grilled cheese with the seafood on it. It was a nice way to try lobster roll, crab, and shrimp roll all at once for a quick grab and go bite. Decently priced for the amount we got to try. Definitely more like a fast food chain."
733,33,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,2/13/2022,We stumbled across this place after ice skating at the front pond. My husband and daughter got the grilled cheese lobster (absolutely amazing) and the lobster Mac and cheese. I got the spicy lobster roll (I didn't like it but that was my mistake because it clearly said spicy on the menu) and the clam chowder. The clam chowder was great. We got some cold  tea drinks from refrigerator which was ok nothing outstanding. Overall it was decent little place. Super casual and not a lot of seating but we went there was just on other couple. It appeared clean and the staff were very friendly. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but if I was area I would go back for the grilled cheese lobster and clam chowder.
734,34,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,7/21/2021,"I've got lobstermen in my family, so I can be kind of a snob when it comes to this kind of place. The fact that it's downtown without a waterfront view made me a little nervous (even though most of those places serve subpar seafood).  I tried this place and WOW this is the best lobster roll I've had south of Maine.  Staff was clean quick and friendly. Amazing."
735,35,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,1/27/2022,"First time in Boston and our first eating spot was Luke's. Their rolls are AMAZING! We tried the trio which came with 3 2oz rolls(crab, lobster, shrimp) and ALL were delicious. The bread was toasted just the right amount and was drizzled with butter. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. Stayed in Boston for 3 days and ate at this pace twice because of how good it was!"
736,36,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,1/8/2022,"Kinda Pricey. The rolls are cold.
The service is good thou.

They have a winter menu

Clam chowder and lobster Mac is a must try!"
737,37,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,9/1/2021,"It melts in your mouth! sooooo good! 
At first I was a little shocked by the small menu. But when you know what you do well, you do it! 
Luke knows what they do well!!! Holy Cow those are some good rolls!!"
738,38,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,4/26/2021,"I had avoided coming to Luke's Lobster as I am not a fan of cold lobster rolls which is what they are known for. However, closer inspection of the menu showed that they sold lobster mac and cheese and most importantly they delivered via Door Dash. Wanting to satisfy my lobster craving without going to the usual busy, touristy spots I decided to give them a try and order delivery.

I was quite satisfied with the mac and cheese. Food came warm and there was plenty of lobster in the dish. Yes, the serving is on the small size, however it is sold at a much lower price than at the other places and it was sufficient for a meal. Would definitely recommend if looking for another place to eat more lobster."
739,39,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,11/4/2020,"The food here is SO good. Got it delivered and wasn't able to eat it hot but every single roll and the Mac and cheese were still phenomenal! I especially enjoyed the crab and shrimp rolls, lobster was a very close tie. They were all buttery and seasoned very well. This was sufficient for 2 people with a moderate appetite. 

I'd come here more if the portions were a bit larger or if it came with more filling side options. I know seafood is expensive but would love having a simple but filling veggie side to make it a bit more affordable on the regular."
740,40,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/21/2021,"Amazing! That's why we go to the east to have crab, lobster, and shrimp!! In fact they have the little sampler roll on the menu where you can get 3 mini rolls of each lobster, crab, and shrimp! Highly recommend trying this! They also had a corn crab chowder as their special of the day which was very flavorful. My favorite was probably the lobster Mac n cheese side, it was so fun to get a big chunk of lobster meat every few bites. Service was pretty efficient being able to order at the counter and then picking your seat. A must try in back bay"
741,41,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,11/6/2021,A counter-service place specializing in lobster rolls. I personally don't like the mayo kind of lobster roll but if you're into that they have several that are good. They do have specials and had a truffle lobster roll warm with butter that was amazing.
742,42,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/8/2022,"First time having a lobster roll, it was delicious. My friend had lobster mac and cheese and was thoroughly impressed. They had good inside seating and a good aesthetic. 10/10 recommend"
743,43,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,10/8/2021,"I really wanted to love this place based on the great reviews I read. This was actually the first place I visited on my weekend trip to boston from NY. However, I was a bit disappointed in their lobster roll. The lobster was fresh but the size of the roll is way too small for the price. I also felt that the pepper taste was a little overwhelming. My friends also got their clam chowder and the Luke's Trio which includes 1/2 crab, 1/2 lobster, and 1/2 shrimp. I believe they liked the crab the most out of the bunch. The clam chowder was decent but wasn't too impressive. We enjoyed the clam chowder at Atlantic Fish & Co way better. In all, I probably wouldn't come back here if I'm in Boston because there are other spots that are better."
744,44,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/13/2021,"We got this door dashed and I did not get another lobster roll in Boston because this one was so good. Be forewarned, it is small but SO worth it. The lobster was incredible and the bread was so fresh. I could have eaten a million of those lobster rolls."
745,45,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,12/23/2021,"We enjoyed quiet setting after busy day of shopping. Lobster was so delicious but buns were cold. I wish they warmed it more. We got Luke Trio , lobster, shrimp and crab sandwich. And regular lobster roll if the bread was warmer, it might been better."
746,46,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,7/25/2021,"We come here from Florida and make this our first stop.  The lobster is so fresh and the service is great.  

Can't wait to go back!"
747,47,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,1 star rating,2/22/2022,"We went and tried quite a few items. The rolls were ok, cold and would have preferred warm.  The clam chowder and lobster bisque were also lukewarm and had not many clams nor lobster in it.  Luke's trio and lobster Mac n cheese is just enough food for 13yo. The boys were still hungry afterwards. All the food were prepackaged and just heated up and toasted (like Starbucks) and not made in site. We wanted to try rolls and chowder in Boston but quiet disappointed to pay so much for cold prepackaged food that was not enough..  this post"
748,48,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/19/2021,Best lobster I have ever had and best lobster roll I have had in Boston so far (I've tried 3 so far).  Friendly and not too packed.  The lobster chowder was also to die for!
749,49,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,7/23/2021,"First meal in Boston I & my first lobster roll. It was really good!  Light dressing on the lobster roll & plenty of big, succulent pieces of lint. Not a bunch of fillers. The poppyseed cole slaw was fresh, but needed more dressing. All in all a great welcome to bean town. Got a spicy ginger ale & it was a great accompaniment to the delicate lobster. I'll be back!"
750,50,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,1/26/2022,A little more pricey than I expected but everywhere is raising prices. Fresh food and the clam chowder was excellent the day I came. It wasn't busy during a January lunch hour so stop by!
751,51,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,7/2/2021,"Stopped by on a rainy afternoon while visiting a friend in Boston, and we met up here at their suggestion. Ordered the family pack of 6oz. lobster rolls for everyone, along with a large clam chowder. The food is excellent, the rolls are FILLED with yummy lobster--slightly more than advertised, and the soup is hearty and substantial. I'll make a note that I despise cole slaw in all forms, but the side provided here at Luke's is actually quite decent."
752,52,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,6/13/2021,Just moved to Boston and my goal is to find the best lobster roll. I got the 6 oz lobster roll...go big or go home. I added on their special that day which was truffle butter. The lobster was fresh and tasty! The roll wasn't doused in butter and didn't over power the taste of the seafood. This place tops it for me so far!
753,53,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,11/18/2021,Our first night in town and we were exhausted! So we ditched our into all dining out plans and ordered in from Luke's. The lobster roll was mouthwatering
754,54,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/1/2021,"Not that many people on Thursday night. No reservation and walk-in only. The Lobster roll tastes fresh and great! Lobster Mac & Cheese is also good, but I might just order the lobster roll when I come back."
755,55,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,11/17/2020,"*NEEDS CUSTOMERS SERVICE TRAINING*
Perhaps I went in on a bad time for the staff but my visit left me with a ""I don't know if I'll ever come back"" thought. I was so excited to try this spot, the lobster rolls are truly AMAZING. I entered Luke's happy, I said ""hi! Good afternoon"" to the 2 gentlemen who where behind the counter, none of them answered. The man who took my order was very short and overall looked as if he was in a crappy mood. There was no welcoming feeling, no ""hi"" no ""thank you"" nothing. A straight ""what are you going to order"" & ""your total is etc."" Would I come back? Maybe, (the rolls are delicious) but if I do, I will order pick up and save myself the awkward service."
756,56,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/10/2020,"I've been to Luke's lobsters now two times and we decided to go to the one in Back Bay for dine in because the other locations I believe are either temporarily closed due to covid and aren't accepting dine in services which makes sense because they are much smaller compared to the back bay location. 

The staff here was super nice and food came out in a reasonable time but we did order a lot so that's understandable. The food was super good and my partner is visiting from Arizona and loves the lobster rolls from here so I have to take him here everytime he is in town. We got the trio which was like half of a regular roll and was good and ended up ordering another roll because we were still hungry. I got the shrimp roll and he got the crab I believe."
757,57,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/11/2021,"Since we were visiting from California, Boston lobster roll was a must try dish on our list! We came across Luke's Lobster Back Bay as one of the most recommended places on yelp besides Pauli's in the north end. We decided to stop by for a quick lunch before heading to Cambridge across the bridge. I believe it's located on the street right behind Boston Public Library. We ordered 2 Regular size Lobster Rolls and they were so good!!! The lobster was cut in chunks coated in their flavorful seasonings along with melted butter on the side that made everything so delicious! The lobster was fresh and comparable to the ones we had in Maine. I have to say the best part was the bread/bun they used for the lobster rolls. It was so crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. We were totally impressed with the way this place made their buns. I highly recommended anyone who is visiting Boston to try this place! Unfortunately, we didnt get a chance to take pics because the lobster rolls were so delicious that we literally inhaled them in less than 15mins :)"
758,58,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,7/23/2021,"Truly enjoyed the Luke's trio (wow-- the shrimp was great). Priced fairly for the amount. Sadly, minus one star for the air conditioning not working- it was ungodly hot and very uncomfortable inside even with the doors open."
759,59,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,12/27/2021,"There are lobster rolls to be had all over the place (albeit much more expensive).  
Special here: I love their Jonah Crab roll.  A delicacy.  Reminds me of Dungeness on the West Coast.  My only issue is the two sizes seem indistinguishable, imo.  
I submit that they would get a lot more customers if they somehow made themselves more visible to Boylston St, just the other side of the Lenox Hotel.
ETA: Almost forgot because I live nearby: There is live parking at most.  But almost everyone I see there is walk-in.
One last thing: Testimonials to them are the brown bags with tags lined up on the counter."
760,60,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,11/13/2021,Best Lobster Roll in the world. Get it with truffle butter. Pass on the chowder though. Sorry but not so much.
761,61,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,9/28/2020,"Came here on National Lobster Day to try their lobster rolls. We overheard the person ahead of us order their roll with extra seasoning and decided to go down the same path and I'm really glad we did. The roll with extra seasoning was so tasty. We also tried both the bisque and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was rich and had a distinct seafood flavor that I liked. 

I've also listened to a podcast episode with the founders about how Luke's Lobster is supporting their workers like fishermen during this pandemic and I have to say they're doing an amazing job adapting and helping as many people as possible."
762,62,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,4/2/2021,Excellent chain in Boston and we love it here . Had several lobster and crab rolls and also had some soup as well. So good and we will for sure be back. Service was friendly and prices were reasonable.
763,63,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,11/1/2021,"Solid lobster roll and clam chowder. As with most chowder, this could use more meat but it has a good flavor. I'll deduct 1 Star for the price.  $41 (including tip) for a small roll and chowder/no drink, is a little much considering it's basically a fast food joint- meaning not much atmosphere for eating in. Sure tasted good though."
764,64,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,10/5/2021,I used online ordering which was a breeze. This was my first experience having a lobster roll. Luke's did not disappoint. And to my surprise the lobster Mac and cheese was even better than I would have ever imagine. It's a must try.
765,65,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/6/2021,Wow! This place was amazing! I was in town for the day and can't wait to come back. I couldn't believe how much lobster was in my roll. Lukes's doesn't mess around! The clam chowder was also incredibly yummy! The slaw was great but after the chowder and lobster roll I had no room left for the slaw. Service was fast and very friendly! I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.
766,66,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,3/3/2021,Amazing! Best place to grab some great lobster or crab rolls. Very clean and friendly service.
767,67,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,11/20/2021,Delicious food and very friendly staff!! Definitely a must visit when in Boston. :) I highly recommend the lobster grilled cheese but the rolls are good too!

Below is a quick explanation of my rating mechanism:
1star: Absolutely horrible and will not come back under any circumstances 
2 stars: Way below my initial expectation with very few highlights. Will only come back to order specific courses if my friend strongly insist.  
3 stars: Average with some turn-offs. Might give it a second chance to test more dishes out. 
4 stars: Meets expectation with a couple highlights. Will come back. 
5 stars: Exceeds my expectation by various aspects. Will come back quite often and also recommend the place to my friends. 

An overdue review for my first lobster roll experience after moving to BOS this summer. It will prob serve as the benchmark of the many more lobster rolls to come in the near future. The restaurant offers limited dine-in and outside seating options. The credit card reader is placed on a stand in-between the customers and the cashier to create additional social distance. 

The interior of the restaurant is almost as simple as you couple imagine, which directly draws your attention to the menu above the open kitchen. The menu, again, is quite straightforward, which includes Lobster Combo, Crab Combo, Shrimp Combo, or Luke's Trio (which includes 1/3 of all the three options). One highlight is that for the drink included in the combo, you can pick whatever is available in the fridge (flavored sparkling water, soda, and other non-alcoholic drinks) with no additional cost. 
 
Luke's Trio with Coreslaw ($23): RECOMMEND
I have to say that it has exceeded my expectation (built from my limited experiences with lobster roll in other cities) for a chain restaurant. The rolls are loaded with seafood with minimum seasonings (sale, pepper, and butter on the interior of the rolls). The seafood all tastes fresh and sweet and no scent of fishy taste from the shrimps at all. The lobster roll is my personal favorite among the three, so I will likely get a full-length lobster roll next time but really you can't go wrong with any of the three. 

My only complaint would be the portion size as I feel I can easily finish another roll for lunch. Other than that, it's been really everything I can expect from my first lobster roll experience here.  Will certainly come back again."
769,69,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,1/9/2020,"One of my to go spots when I'm in Boston, they are good quick and delicious. Every time I have visited Boston I come to Luke's. They don't disappoint. They have a good atmosphere and centrally located. The quality is really good as well, and the staff is amazing, sweet and helpful! 

If you're looking for a quick bite but also something that good and very delicious this is the spot. I usually get the hot lobster roll because it's buttery and delicious and my boyfriend likes the cold lobster roll which is also mouth-watering. Their clam chowder soup is also one of my favorites with a side of chip I am in heaven, writing this review is making me crave them and want a roll. Soon I will be back!"
770,70,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,12/9/2019,"I came here twice within three days. 
It's a little pricey but they really give you a lot of lobster  meat in your lobster rolls. And they're freaking delicious. 
You order and sit down and they bring out the food for you. 
No fountain drinks- just bottled drinks. If you ordered a drink with your meal, you just grab the drink in the fridge. 
I really wanted to try their three sandwich combo but I can't eat a lot so I just stuck with the lobster roll combo. 
Whatever you do, get the soup and sandwich combo. I tried both the bisque and the chowder. Chowder obviously has potatoes and clam in the soup but the bisque is just the soup itself with nothing else in it. 
The second time I went, they made a mistake and brought the wrong soup and the server was kind enough to bring me the right one. Ended up not eating it because I found hair :( 
Anyway- definitely worth it if you're in town!"
771,71,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,8/29/2020,"I wanted to like this place so bad! I have tried two different locations in New York City and I had always thought they were pretty good. I mean to give them credit, we had just gotten lobster rolls and clam chowder from Quincy market just a few hours earlier.

Their lobster rolls are all right, But my favorite from Luke's lobster has always been their crab rolls. Don't get their lobster bisque! It is way too salty and rich."
772,72,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,7/27/2020,I went in there and it was shockingly quiet due to the effects of covid. it was just simply empty and they had a couple of pickups you're in there. But I went in with my family and ordered the $65 lobster roll special (four lobster rolls) and clam chowder. It was so good and it's always been a very busy place so I never really bothered coming in. but I'm happy to say that the food was delicious and if anybody's around the back Bay they should pop in. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.
773,73,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,12/25/2019,"Great quick spot when you want a fresh bite. Stopped here with my parents after enjoying the library and they loved it. We had the clam chowder, lobster rolls and the Mac and cheese. All super good and well worth the price. My dad said he usually doesn't like lobster, but loved this! Way to go! Must of been the toasted bun they served the lobster on. Toasted to perfection. 
Service was fast and super friendly considering it took us a while to decide what to get. Glad for their patience. 
And the bathrooms were nice and clean-thank you! Definitely will come back."
774,74,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,6/4/2021,I got the Luke's Trio! I'm gluten free so I asked for the Gf Bread (which was honestly one of the best GF breads I've ever had). They asked at the counter whether it was an allergy or a preference as they would put it on a separate grill depending on if it was an allergy.
775,75,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,2/2/2020,"Really cute place! Came here to get the classic lobster roll, and it was pretty good! Well toasted bread, butter, and fresh lobster. We also got the combo and tried both the lobster bisque and the clam chowder. Both were decent, but I liked the clam chowder better. 

The service here was really great though! I also liked how the combo came with cute drinks (I got a blueberry wildflower honey lemonade). I feel like definitely a staple for the Boston experience."
776,76,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,1/25/2021,"This place is awesome! The service is a little slow but the attention to quality and presentation makes up for it. As an Arizona native I never knew what a good lobster roll tasted like until I took a trip to Boston. Luke's is easily the most delicious, pure, and simple seafood restaurants that I have ever been to. The ingredients are light and they really let you appreciate the natural flavor of the seafood."
777,77,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,8/27/2020,"Apparently I've never had a ""real"" crab roll because this was one of the tastiest rolls I've ever had.  The seasoning was perfect, the crab was so tender but definitely not overcooked and the butter roll that it was on was so buttery.  I really wanted a second one but that would have been greedy.  I also had the lobster bisque.  My only complaint is that I would've loved a little more lobster in my bisque but the flavor was perfect.  We also had the shrimp roll and slaw.  I'd recommend this place to anyone who loves a good seafood roll.  I'll definitely be back."
778,78,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,5/18/2021,The food was pretty good. I think the atmosphere was a little bit awkward. I chose this place because of their reviews & I'm not totally sure I was steered in the right direction but it was good enough.
779,79,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,9/17/2019,"Hanging out around the Fenway area, I was looking for a Lobster roll, so my friend recommended Luke's which was his go-to. After going, I can see why. The concept is simple where you just order and within several minutes your food is ready to go. I'm okay with this since I don't need to go to a nice place and pay extra when I'm just eating a sandwich. 

With that being said, I think Luke's offers a reasonable price for Lobster rolls especially for the area and they also offer different sizes that are priced accordingly. The lobster meat was juicy and succulent and was just what I needed. I also went with the clam chowder which was pretty good, but honestly kind of expensive for a small cup.

Nonetheless, I liked the quick service and fresh seafood options so I'd recommend it to anyone in the area who's on a quest to find a great lobster roll."
780,80,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,6/4/2021,Had a craving for lobster rolls and this place really hit the spot. We dined in and the place was clean and spotless. The person who served us was patient and nice while we figured out what we wanted. The food came out very quickly too. I ordered the lobster roll with the chip and drink(got sea salt chips and root beer) while my boyfriend ordered the crab roll. Both were amazing and we can't wait to go back to the trio roll!
781,81,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,3 star rating,9/11/2019,"Ok.. When I write this review, I am not trying to be rude or anything but I really did feel confused when I came here. 

Our trip was coming to an end and thought we would swing by here since it had such good reviews. We've been in Boston for 5 days now and we have already tried two different Lobster Rolls at two different spots. Both spots did not impress us at all since we've heard nothing but amazing things about these lobster rolls that are famous in Boston.

I walked in and thought the decor was very inviting. I took a look at the menu and there wasn't much there to read, only a few items to choose from. I ordered the Lobster combo (comes with a side of Soup and a drink), price was $27. There was an option to upgrade to the ""Jumbo Roll"" for an extra $6.50. My wife never likes to eat an entire sandwich and thought it would be perfect for us to split (she would eat half and I would eat the other). SOOO I upgraded to ""Jumbo Roll""... Man, was I disappointed with what they brought out. They brought out the same size sandwich I had at the other two spots. So, of course I had to ask if this was correct. They told me that was in fact the ""jumbo roll"". I kept thinking to myself, no way in the world this could be it, it was the same damn size. 

What it boiled down to was the ""normal"" size is about half the bread and only 4 ounces of Lobster. The jumbo size (normal to me) was the normal size bread (about two inches bigger), and it comes with 2 more ounces of meat, totally 6 ounces of Lobster. No where in this place is this explained nor are there any examples of sizes for which these come in when you order. My wife and I would have never ordered the jumbo if we had even the slightest clue. 

Lesson learned I guess..... Wife ended up ordering a large portion of Clam Chowder for $10.. $10!!!! I understand Boston is known for the sea food and such, but hot damn that was expensive for a little bit larger than a cup of clam chowder. Either way, she ordered it and ate it. It was good (I had the smaller portion with my combo). 

We ended up spending $47 for what appeared to be a semi-fast food restaurant. I am not too worried about the money but wasn't expecting that what so ever. 

I gave them 3 stars because even though the sandwich wasn't what I considered to be ""Jumbo"", it was the best one I had in Boston!!

I just feel maybe they could be a bit better in explaining exactly what ""jumbo"" means on their menu. And I feel their prices are a bit higher all around.  

If you're looking for Clam Chowder, order it at a restaurant and its going to be better quality and a couple dollars cheaper (depending on the dining place of course, fine dining which Lukes Lobster is not, it will probably be around the same price or more). 

If you're looking for one of the best Lobster Rolls I've tasted (that's a total of 3 my entire life LOL), come here and get the Roll ONLY!!"
782,82,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,7/17/2021,"Excellent lobster roll and bisques.  Good size and price, and the taste was excellent.  Nice combo meal options as well, and an option to increase the size of the rolls."
783,83,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,5 star rating,9/20/2021,"I've been to this location a few times now and it's always been a pleasant experience. I go for the Luke's trio which is so delicious! The portion size is a bit small and it's a bit on the pricier side, but the food melts in your mouth and you can tell it's great quality seafood, so it's worth it!"
784,84,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,7/4/2021,"Delicious food, friendly staff, cozy setting with 4 tables, and bar table against the wall, about ~20 people at full capacity! Only point taken off was due to higher price, Lobster/crab/shrimp trio $23 ( small 1/3 roll each with a lot of meat) clam chowder large $9.5, plus taxes and tips, I spent $40 for 1 person. Yet the experience was pleasant nonetheless!"
785,85,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,1 star rating,1/23/2022,Sorry- the people were nice but food was really horrible. Tasteless.. lobster Mac and cheese was horrible.
786,86,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,9/24/2019,"I have been on a journey to find Boston's best lobster roll. I had to stop at Luke's.

The ambiance is casual but you will see various professionals who stop in on their break to have a lobster roll. The service is great and the people are very knowledgeable about their menu.

I had the lobstah roll, clam chowdah and a raspberry lemonade. I read a review where someone said the clam chowder wasn't great. My tip is to ask for a sample before you buy. I tasted it before I ordered and it was amazing! The lobster roll was ok, not my favorite. I'm not sure if there is a 'warm' option but I didn't particularly like the cold lobster roll taste paired with a very warm chowder. 

I would go again, but not for a cold lobster roll."
787,87,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,2 star rating,10/29/2021,Ordered two crab rolls and it looked like cheap crab meat from a can. Not even mayo... what happened Luke?!?!?!
788,88,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,4 star rating,7/31/2019,"Great Lobster Rolls and soups right off Boylston in Boston. Despite being a more commercialized national chain restaurant, the quality at Luke's was very impressive. 

Came in for lunch and went with a lobster roll and lobster bisque; this combo came with a soda but was a bit pricey at around $25. 

The lobster roll was delicious, full of nice chunks of lobster, flavored nicely and with the bun buttered perfectly. My lobster bisque wasn't bad either and my wife's clam chowder was also tasty and highly enjoyed. Luke's has some cool bottled soda's as well, with the Blueberry Lemonade being my recommendation. 

Luke's prides themselves on offering ""traceable"" seafood and display where the current crustaceans originated. Staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean and most importantly the food was good quality."
789,89,Luke's Lobster Back Bay,2 star rating,9/22/2021,"I don't think their seafood is fresh. The lobster roll has shredded meat, unlike the other places which normally have lobster chunks. The Mayo and seasoning covers any lobster taste."
0,0,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,5 star rating,5/14/2016,"I feel obligated to give Kipos 5 stars because there is no way on Earth (or any other planet for that matter) that it deserves an overall rating under 4 stars. 

After reading all the reviews for Kipos, I was very apprehensive to check it out. 1.5 stars, really? It can't be that bad. If it wasn't for my close proximity, I probably would've just skipped it, but I'm so glad I didn't. 

First off, when I walked in the door, the sweet older gentleman and his presumptive wife were in there, MAKING THE DOUGH FROM SCRATCH! THIS IS NOT A TYPO! This alone should warrant a couple stars! You don't find your local Dominos putting in this kind of effort. 

They have a pretty extensive menu, but being primarily a pizza joint, I decided to try a calzone. I got the chicken parm calzone and let's just say this thing was a monster. For 11 bucks, you get a monster calzone that barely fit in the box! 

Once I sprinted home to sink my mitts and fangs into this monstrosity I had to cut it in half because it was so darn big. This allowed me to get a cross sectional view of all the delicious insides of this beast. It was loaded down with cheese and sauce and chicken, and I mean loaded down. Everything tasted so hot and fresh, I feel like what I got was in a different universe from that I was expecting after reading the previous reviews. 

There's no doubt I'll be going back, and now not just out of sheer convenience but because Kipos is awesome! A local place like Kipos that has been around in Charlestown for a while is right in my wheelhouse for places I love. Support local!"
1,1,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,5 star rating,11/5/2020,"Pizza is not great honestly but the guy serving the pizza was the man! Tight knit neighborhood spot you can tell, wish I could've tried more food."
2,2,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,2 star rating,10/27/2018,Chicken fingers or tenders they are the  same thing and sorry to say they continue to disappoint. I liked the Fry's but it's been a while since I had them. I get a Coke or a frappe there once in a while. They seem to be nice people.
3,3,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,1 star rating,11/23/2019,"It's been a long time since I have ordered hear but I recently ordered from here and they was rude so I said to myself just let it go.

6,6,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,2 star rating,2/18/2018,"Tasteless pizza ... Legit. Subs are ok , calzones are like meat encased in a heavy brick of dough, cold cuts are good , the fries are probably the best thing they have , chicken fingers are gamey and rubbery tasting.  The clientele is mostly young kids which probably explains its surprising longevity in the area."
7,7,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,1 star rating,7/28/2010,"Stop. Just stop right there. Who are you people? They USED to have bad pizza? 3 stars? 4 stars?!! Stop it!

Look, this isn't about pizza snobbery. I've had good pizza, and I've had mediocre pizza. But I love pizza in nearly every form. Those little frozen pizza bagels are fantastic to me! Even the greasiest late night bar crawl pizza is still tasty because it's pizza! People groan about Hi-Fi in Central Square, Cambridge. Sure it's not GREAT pizza... but it's still pizza and it's still tasty. Soggy, crispy, deep dish, thin crust, burnt, greasy, rubbery... I've endured it all and I've gone back for seconds. I love pizza. Who doesn't?

Kipos should not exist. This was, by far, the worst pizza I've ever had in my entire life... fresh... frozen... or otherwise. I couldn't even understand it. My brain simply could not fathom how a business could sell this and call it brick oven pizza. How can a business sell this and maintain a customer base? How are they making their money? Somebody has to explain this to me!

First of all, the establishment is a wreck. Ceiling fans hanging by wires, chairs and boxes piled up in the back like they're on their way to the dump, but they're not... they're covered in dust. It's as though this is some sort of sorrowful tribute to a bygone era. There's even an arcade machine sitting unplugged and covered in dust.

I ordered a large cheese pizza. The most simple of pies. They reached under the counter... shuffled a bit... and out came a pie, in mere seconds. It looked frozen, perhaps... I honestly can't say. But it was not made from anything fresh. My thoughts? Even frozen pizza is kind of ok... so I'll go with it.

I'm not the type of person to refuse to pay for an ordered meal... but man, in this case I wish I was. This pizza was awful. Thin little slices of  cardboard with crusty cheese on them. You could hold the slice vertically and nothing would move. You could throw it like a frisbee (I actually made the motion vigorously with a slice) and none of the ingredients moved. It wouldn't bend, flop, slide, or drip. This is NOT pizza. It reminded me of that scene in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation when the turkey explodes... and they're all sitting around eating these little nuclear bits of crispy flesh.

Seriously guys... maybe it's run by a family of good people. But don't support this mess. They're not even trying. These good people need to move on and run something easier like an ice cream stand. They do sell ice cream here. Maybe that's where their bread and butter lies."

My son had the pizza, didnt even want to finish it, they use the microwave for heating and cooking most of their food (no! ) they have to customer service skills to save their life. After i ordered for delivery once i said never again the lady knocked on my door and i told her more then once to hold on because i was in the bathroom and i know she could hear me (small house thin walls) she had someone bang on my window to get me to rush and come to the door"

10,0,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,4/3/2022,"I don't reside in Boston, so my reviews tend to be of the places I love.  Caffe Vittoria is such a place.  A visit to Caffe Vittoria is a bit like stepping back in time to the 1930's.  It is also assuredly an opportunity to enjoy the best cappuccino in the USA.   

Service is not always consistent, so don't be in a rush.  It's ok to take your time and savor things."
11,1,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,1/12/2022,"Best. Cappuccino. Ever. 

I visited Boston from the SF Bay Area and really enjoyed the ambiance + coffee here. The powder on top elevated the drink a lot - subtle chocolate flavor lightly sweetened with the frothiness of the milk. 

Super yummy and would be such a great spot for a date or a drink with friends!"
12,2,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,12/16/2021,"I visit the cafe whenever I walk through the north end and it was a cute place! There were no issues being seated, but do expect indoors to be loud and crowded on weekend evenings. If you'd like a quieter experience, I recommend visiting earlier in the day. That being said, The BEST tiramisu in town. The espresso martini's are good, as well as the cappuccino.

Some things about the cafe:
-Have cash on hand
-it seems to be open pretty late, which is a plus factor.
-I'm not sure if it's because the building is old but there's an almost smoke like smell engrained into the building and walls. It reeks, almost like cigars, but there's no smoking allowed indoors so I'm not sure where it comes from. It's the biggest factor of why I don't like being in there too long. I eat my tiramisu and martini and leave asap.
-Due to the nature of the building being old, it seems they haven't renovated their bathrooms. There's holes in the walls in the bathrooms, which is creepy to say the least. 

Overall, they can preserve the buildings history while still making upgrades that would help out the cafe tons I'm sure. Still, good food and drinks and worth a stop when in the north end."
13,3,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/21/2022,So cute. Old school vibe with lots of locals. Friendly service -- all the espresso perfect for after a hearty Italian meal. almond milk cappuccino was perfect and the tiramisu was gone in 60 seconds. Perfect balance and not too sweet. I hear they have the best espresso martini :)
14,4,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,4/4/2022,Wish they had more options for non-coffee drinking customers. They only take cash only so be prepared for that.
15,5,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,3/13/2022,"Stopped in for a drink and to get out of the rain. Fun Italian vibe. Drinks were good but pricey, then again it is Boston and the North End. Service was great. Did not eat anything but the pastries looked good.  One day of my companions said it is the best espresso martini anywhere - could be fun to find out for yourself!"
16,6,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,11/28/2021,"A pretty cool ass cafe. Cafe Vittoria is a place to sip on some coffee or something more strong if you prefer a liquor. It has a pretty small menu of classy pastries and expensive things. Everything isn't extremely expensive though but it's more costly than a typical bakery. They also have desserts like sorbet. 

It doesn't have that much of a menu. Mostly it seems to be desserts and few things in the way of entrees and such. This is pretty much where to come after you've already eaten out and lie about being too full for dessert there. Coffee is a beverage of choice. There's also plenty of the classy hard stuff. I'm a Ladies Man so I get my Courvoisier. Please tell me you got the SNL reference there. It's $10 for a pour. They also have a Lemon Sorbet. It's $7 for a cup. This is fluffier than most sorbets. It has a light tartness that's not overwhelming or bitter. The only bad thing is it melts pretty fast so eat fast. 

A good place for classy desserts. It also has coffee and cognacs to sip on. The sorbet is the best palette cleanser so get it to finish up."
17,7,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,11/7/2021,"Stopped in for a cappuccino and walked out with a smile!

This CASH ONLY cafe knows how to do things right here. Their artistic creations brings happiness along with your drink.

This place is located on a very busy street so the crowd tends to shuffle in and spend some time enjoying the menu items."
18,8,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,12/5/2021,"Stopped by after dinner in the North End for some desserts and drinks on a Saturday night. This place was packed, but thankfully there are several floors so we were seated pretty quickly in the basement level.

Their menu is pretty expansive with a full bar and pretty much every coffee drink combination you could hope for. I got a mocha and flan for dessert. Upstairs vibe was loud, eclectic cafe x bar energy. Downstairs felt more like a pub with dark lighting, booths, woodsy interiors, and fewer people. Service was a bit slow, but to be expected due to the time.

Mocha was great and flan was rich and dense. Nice place to chat with friends and stay warm post dinner if you're not ready to head home yet. 

As a heads up, they were closing the basement level around 9:30pm on a Saturday and pretty much ushered us out (or we could have gone upstairs to wait for another table where it was really crowded). Something to keep in mind if you want to go chill here for a while. Also was cash only."
19,9,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,2/9/2022,"I absolutely love this cafe! This is a cash only place, and like most of North End establishments, it is pretty small so it can be a tight squeeze seating-wise. The inside is so cute, it's like being in an antique shop (in the best way!). Not to mention, their sweets are soo good. The tiramisu was perfection - not too sweet and had the right consistency. The limoncello mascarpone was on the sweeter side and also incredibly delicious."
20,10,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/15/2022,"BEST TIRAMISU EVER!! Come here after dinner for an amazing dessert. Its so light and fluffy, we had to order a second one it was so good."
21,11,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,11/12/2021,"Splendid.

Even though I do not drink coffee, I can tell their drinks are rich in flavor. They are also whimsical in appearance, fair in price, and vintage in name.

Whether you are going for an early morning pick me up, or that late night hopper, this is unparalleled value. Hard working ladies will ensure that you enjoy your hot beverage against the backdrop of 1940's and 1950's crooners swooning you with old favorites. It was a really special and unique experience that you can have too if you bring cash (sorry, no credit cards here folks). 

The best part was seeing customers recycle in and out. It seems people always want to be a part of something special here.

No wonder, because this cafe is something special."

Be aware that it is cash-only, tables are very close to each other, and the staff wear their masks under their chins (and do not respect personal boundaries, even after we asked nicely that they keep a little bit of distance). There is no excuse for being rude to customers and I'm sure there are other cafes with good cappuccinos in the area. (visited 11/7/15 and 12/31/21)"
24,14,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,9/6/2021,"By far my favorite cafe in North End! SUCH a cute shop with gorgeous interior design-- I love how they have old coffee machines/grinders and rustic framed posters. If you catch a spot by the window, you can get some natural sunlight and people watch. I came here 3 times during my one week Boston trip! 

Over three visit, I've tried their famous cappuccino, cannoli, tiramisu, iced latte, and americano. My favorite drink is the cappuccino and favorite dessert is the tiramisu by far. No complaints about the cappuccino-- the portion size was also quite large! Although the cannoli was very delicious already (especially dipped in the cappuccino!), their tiramisu is the best I've ever had. The flavor was so rich and I could really taste strong espresso in the soaked layers of cake. 

A perfect place to chill with a book, journal, or catch up with a friend, highly recommend!"
25,15,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/29/2021,"OMG! This has become my favorite haunt in North End. 

My friends and I all agreed that this place boasts the best tiramisu we've ever had. The first time we came, we split one slice and collectively finished it in about 30 seconds lol. My friend said he really liked the cannolis here too.

My favorite part of this shop is how their menu complements each other. I'd recommend pairing their pastries with a coffee drink with no sugar added, as the natural bitterness of espresso acts as a great palate cleanser in between bites of their sweet, creamy pastries. 

I was also a big fan of the venue, with seats next to their street-side windows. The natural sunlight here in the morning is great. 

Just be warned that this cafe, like most places in North End, is cash only, so come prepared! You definitely don't want to miss out."
26,16,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,12/18/2021,"Super cute place (very in the Christmas spirit when we went), very busy on a Saturday night, and they are CASH ONLY (but very fairly priced). We only tried the gelato which was delicious. I would love to go back and try their coffees and pastries as they also looked really good."
27,17,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,9/24/2021,"100% recommend!!! This was a highlight of our trip. To sit at a small Italian cafe (in the heart of little Italy) and be surrounded by individuals speaking the language helped us realize we were in for a treat. 

We ordered cappuccinos along with a slice of tiramisu. WOWOW... my mouth is watering thinking about it."
28,18,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,7/19/2021,"A quaint little spot to grab an Italian coffee and pastry. I especially loved seeing all of the espresso machines that the caffe has collected to display.

This caffe really reminded me of being back in Italy. You could walk into a bar, grab a quick coffee, say hello to friends, and then run off to continue your day. At Caffe Vittoria, much of the same was happening. Locals were stopping in to say hello and get their morning coffee. 

We stopped in hoping to enjoy breakfast pastries and a coffee. We have young children, and this isn't an ideal place to stop if you're worried about getting them something to eat also. The pastries are all rather dessert-like, except of course the biscotti. 

We ordered a cappuccino, americano, and a Napelatano. The pastry was yummy and very rich. The coffees were perfect. It's definitely a great place to stop for a coffee break and to have a seat and watch some of the world go by."
29,19,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/3/2021,"Located next to Mike's pastry. FYI do not eat your pastries from Mike's  if you order drinks etc. Not allowed. 

Nice service and we enjoyed our coffees."

31,21,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,7/6/2021,"This was a stop on a food tour and was the ""star of the show"" - cannoli in the opinion of the host was best in all of North End and after having one I could not disagree.  These are not mass produced like some of well known offerings on Hanover.  Not to say they aren't worthy of a stop but each city has those stops that are ""iconic"" but to locals you will find that better offerings are there for the taking (think cheesesteak in Philly, BBQ in Texas, Meixcan food in SoCal - there are well known spots and then the spots that the locals go to have that offering.  

Caffe Vittoria is that place for cannoli - the roll is crispy and not soggy due to pre-filled cheese.  The ricotta cheese is piped in AFTER shell is baked as it should be.  Best bite I had in Boston over the July 4th weekend.  Best sip you ask?  Oh why it was the cappucino here as well.  It was perfect temperature, silky and luscious with each sip.  I will definitely go back here next time around because of this cannoi and cappucino - it was that memorable - an easy 5 stars - don't even have to think about it - the mind doesn't come into it at all - just the taste."
32,22,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,7/17/2021,"My favorite place I visited while in Boston. This quaint, authentic cafe left nothing to be desired. We needed an afternoon pick me up, the cafe Vittoria delivered. We got iced lattes and a scoop of ice cream.

My favorite ice cream is Spumoni and only the authentic Italian places have the good stuff. I was delighted when I found out they offered it. It was so delicious and they drizzled a cherry sauce on top. The iced latte was just what we needed to continue our day - delicious, creamy and topped with coffee beans and chocolate shavings. 

Do yourself a favor and stop in here and enjoy one of the best places I've been to in a long time."

36,26,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,11/8/2021,"Wonderful cafe in the North End. Solid gelato and coffee choices, as well as some alcoholic beverages. We tried the Caffe Mocha and it was wonderful. Service can be a little slow, but definitely worth the stop for an afternoon pick me up as a place to stop and rest before heading out again."
37,27,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,4/11/2021,"My friend and I came on a weekend morning for a sweet treat. The main room was full when we arrived, so we were seated in this back room with a perfect view of the trash barrels outside . I was surprised that the menu didn't have any prices, which made ordering pretty annoying.

We ordered an eclair and tiramisu to share. The eclair was nothing to write home about. It was cold, and the shell was kind of rubbery. The tiramisu, however, was absolutely delicious! It was actually the best tiramisu I've ever had! There wasn't an overwhelming amount of powder on top, and it was the perfect sweetness and texture! 

The service wasn't great though. The waitress barely came by. We wanted to order a second tiramisu, but literally an hour passed since she last checked on us. We literally had to ask for a check while she was finishing taking another table's order - or else who knows when she would come next. She also gave us the wrong receipt.

Overall, we loved the tiramisu and would've gladly gotten a second one. The poor service made the overall experience an okay-ish one. I doubt we'll be back to dine in - I'll try to grab a tiramisu for take out next time."
38,28,Caffé Vittoria,2 star rating,10/17/2021,"This was a definite miss for me. We had mediocre service, it was cash only, and my hazelnut latte was flavorless. 

It doesn't have a cute vibe or anything to make up for the downsides, so I'd look for another place for coffee instead."
39,29,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,10/9/2021,"Arrived on Saturday evening and instantly regretted it because this place was packed. We tried to find a table inside (failed) and then walked out disappointed. I find it curious none of the staff indoors let customers know that there are more seats in the other side of the cafe, which has its own separate entrance, counter, AND bathroom (you could easily mistake it for a restaurant next door). People often enter the side closer to the big white rectangular sign, see the tightly packed marble tables, and walk back out but I can assure you that right next to that entrance is another entrance that will lead to an entirely different lounge with bigger tables. 

I'm giving one star this time because after we failed to find a table for 4 indoors, we took a patio table. Someone came by to take our order while I had left to view the gelato flavors, but afterwards, no one came to take our order again. We tried to request a wait staff from the inside know that our table as well as all the other patio tables were ready to order. When I spoke with the counter staff to see if they could communicate someone to come outside, they stated they would be out but still no one came. We must've waited 20 minutes until we discovered the other lounge and sat at a table indoors yet again. Still no one came, even after it was obvious we had just sat at the back lounge. I spoke to 3 separate staff members to take our order, but it was not until I really took ahold of one by the counter, explaing that we had been waiting a while, that they finally sent someone over to our back table to take our order.  I most definitely understand the struggle of being shortstaffed during peak times and especially during the pandemic, but come on.... there was no apology. There was no ""Thank you for your patience."" Not acceptable. The gelato also came out half melted (not pictured), which was such a contrast to the gelato I was served when I first visited (see photos). This second visit left such a sour taste in my mouth that I don't think I'll be recommending this place to my friends and other locals again."
40,30,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,4/4/2022,"Horrible service.  Servers have an attitude, walked past us more than once to stand and take out their phones.  No smiles, which if you expect a tip you've got to earn it. Disappointing as I had heard so many good things about the espresso martinis.  Beverage itself was good, but didn't get positive vibes from the wait staff"
41,31,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/17/2021,"The ancestors would be very glad dropped by to be frank. It's old school in a good way. Staff is friendly and with Covid I'm sure they are having a time. You can use the QR code for the menu.
I'll tell you this kids I could sit here all day and try all the sweets. I got here before noon cause no true Italian has cappuccino after noon time as it's a breakfast drink. It's beautifully made and hits the spot. The tiramisu was just right not too much of it a nice slice actually if I were you and you were with others order ones for each of you. Most places in the states done really know how to make it.. here it was smooth and creamy.

The inside is lovely it reminds me of this spot I use to go to in Rome. You see the huge copper looking espresso machine.

A FEW THINGS

1)DO NOT BRING STUFF FROM MIKES NEXT DOOR 

2) CASH ONLY

Parking are you for real...it's Lil Italy you can't park right here but it's a 10 walk from the North Station Commuter Train"
42,32,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/17/2021,"This is right next Mike's pastries. The entrance is a bit hidden so just look closely. 
They could improve on their advertising by having their name in a big easel board in front of their store. Also, they need to showcase their pastries better.  These are homemade pastries! To see what they offer, i had to go near the bathroom and take a look. They are inside a fridge and it is not well lit...sigh!! Much can be improved. 
The coffee, hot chocolate and lobster tail was delicious! So yes, i do recommend this place."
43,33,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,1/19/2022,Cute little spot in North End.  Easy ordering at the tables.  We got a couple of hot chocolates to escape the rain and really loved the decor and the drinks.  Will be back!
44,34,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/12/2021,Busy! Cappuccino macchiato and cannoli. We sat outside. Perfection ! Only thing that could use improvement? The way you get an outside seat. It's not clear if you wait or ask.
45,35,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,1/28/2021,"Hot chocolate was just what I needed today with all the snow flurries! My roommate and I love exploring new places in Boston and after coming to this cafe, we will definitely be returning. What's really cool is that it's Boston's first Italian cafe! The decor inside fits the vibe perfectly.

My roommate and I both tried the 'Sleigh Ride' which is hot chocolate with Godiva chocolate and Baileys. It was delicious! The one down side to this cafe is that it is cash only and we didn't know this before we left the apartment. I never carry cash on me, but luckily my roommate had just enough for the drinks. If we had known, we would have brought more cash and tried some of the pastries!"
46,36,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,9/24/2021,I came here at night for the espresso martini and a cannoli. The martini was super good and strong as well. The cannoli filling was sooo good. Service was very fast. Definitely a great place to go for drinks and dessert after dinner. Pro tip: it's cash only
47,37,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,1/13/2021,"Covid review:

I came here in August. 

Cash only !

I love the decor so much.  The coffee and cannolli are basic. Sorry ill say it. The cannoli cream is home made but I can get better down the block. The coffee was okay.  We had some grappa, which was so nice !  Good service too. Overall its a cute spot to sit down and relax for a minute, take in all the cute decor and history."
48,38,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,2/6/2021,"Went to Caffe Vittoria to try their famous limoncello cake slice and it was a hit! This beautiful Italian cafe takes you out of Boston and immediately transports you to Italy. Everything in the caffe makes you feel as if you are somewhere in Europe. The decor and old  coffee machine scattered around the cafe are entertaining to look at. This place is also HUGE I thought it was small, but if you walk to the end of the hall there is a loop that takes you to a different room with more tables and old decor. I would say this is an experience type of coffee place. 

The limoncello cake was a fluffy decadence. It was moist  and the mascarpone icing blends well with this moist cake. I loved the experience!"
49,39,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,6/15/2021,My companion and I were walking through the North End section of Boston and decided on a whim to stop in Caffe Victoria for a cappuccino.  It was the best decision of our day!  We loved the authenticity of the cafe.  There were people chatting in both English and Italian....which added to the experience.  The cappuccino was by far THE BEST we've ever had.  Perfect!  A must when in Boston!
50,40,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,12/13/2021,"This cafe was one of the highlights of our trip. Delicious coffees and desserts with cute vintage decor. We especially enjoyed the cappuccino and tiramisu. 
They only accept cash, so make sure you bring enough to buy different desserts! ;)"
51,41,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,6/13/2021,"Cash Only. When I went here I felt I was teleported back in time, it has a very old-time classic European cafe feel. Everything is very affordable, we got two teas (they use hot water and tea bags) and tiramisu, both very good"
52,42,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,2/4/2022,"Stopped here for hot cocoa during a rainy day. Delicious cocoa and great presentation. They also had the most appetizing desserts. Remember, it's cash only! Also important to note that this place is open late, which makes it the perfect slate night dessert spot"
53,43,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,11/19/2021,"Latte was good, ambiance is good as well. The back part not so, only because it smells like cigar, other than that, the vibe is very Italy! Less a star since they only accept cash and wont allow you to eat anything else, like the cannoli in the picture. As a tourist, we are disappointed."
54,44,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,9/28/2021,"Delicious coffee, dessert and very kitschy atmosphere that makes you feel like you're in Europe. Very nice spot for after dinner. I highly recommend caffe coretto with Fernet Branca. Cheesecake is gluten free if you don't eat the crust, and quite good. Reasonable prices, cash only, service is very casual, so don't be in a hurry."
55,45,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,4/2/2021,"Love Vittoria! I am in the neighborhood a lot, and this is the place we bring folks who are visiting us or we will go just because!  My favorite drink is the hot coco, hands down.  The pastry is always fresh and delicious and would rather be seated at old world charm Vittoria than any other coffee place in the N. End.  Suggestion is that the app menu have a full menu listing of what is offered and have prices of what is offered.  Staff are pretty nice and the place can be extremely busy. It is cash only, prices and full menu please."
56,46,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,8/22/2020,"The espresso martini was good. Tiramisu was only ok nothing more( although we heard amazing reviews on it).
The hazelnut ice cream was good but the pistachio was really not good, it didn't have the flavor of pistachio. This place takes only cash. There are seats inside and outside. I would give this place 3/5 also for social distancing."
57,47,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,1/25/2022,"This place was such a vibe. The whole place was packed with groups of people and the ambiance was super loud. We had to seat ourselves and wait for a waiter to approach us to take our order. For me this place wasn't much for the desserts or drinks they offered but the ambiance, although their desserts are pretty great too. We had so much fun just sitting there and being as loud without getting eyed by people and enjoying our treats. I loved the tiramisu, cotton candy gelato, and the cannoli. Only downside is that you'll probably have to wait forever to get your order taken and getting served. We went on a Monday night and it was full to the point that people were waiting outside in the line to get in."
58,48,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,1/17/2022,Honestly? BEST latte I've probably had from any restaurant. Just add one packet of sugar (obviously your preference) and your set. The place is small but definitely has such a Italian coffee shop vibe. Will continue to go back over and over (:
59,49,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,7/3/2021,"My wife and i ate here this afternoon for the first time. I had a Cappuccino, my wife a regular coffee. For a pastry i ordered the Chocolate Gannoche and my wife had the Tiramisu. He dessert didn't have the rum fflavor typical of Tiramisu and it was small. My dessert was pretty good. So was the Cappuccino. The total was $16.00. The only thing we were not satisfied with was the waitress. Our waitress walked over and just looked at us with a blank stare. We were the ones who had to engage her. She did not smile and was extremely impersonal. A real drag."
60,50,Caffé Vittoria,2 star rating,5/17/2021,"My wife and I were in the area and were looking for a little pick me up before our tour started later in the afternoon. We walked in and stood near the doorway before the waitstaff acknowledged us and finally told us to have a seat at any table. I ordered the cappuccino and my wife had the chinotto (Italian soda). It didn't take long for us to be ready to go, but the waitstaff never came to check on us again after being served the drinks. It got to the point where I went up to the counter to get the bill and pay just so that we could leave at a reasonable time. It was not a busy day, and I could see several waitresses playing on their phones instead of ensuring their customers were taken care of. While the drinks were tasty, if this is the typical experience Caffe Vittoria has to offer, I'd recommend taking your money elsewhere."

We bought some cannolis at Mike's Pastries and came inside with them and were ready to order.  We said we'd like to eat them outside and asked for outside seating, then were told to go outside and wait to be served. Fifteen minutes later we still had no one helping us so we went back inside and then were told again to go outside and wait to be served. Over ten minutes later no one came. Another party who came was instantly served when they sat down. By the time they came to us we had been waiting 30 minutes.  Upon asking for our order we were told there was a policy against eating outside food.... We should have left after waiting ten minutes but the reviews seemed very good.  In any case we were very annoyed at the lack of attention and just decided to leave."
64,54,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/28/2020,"Coffee in America has been morphed into a fast food experience where you wait in a line and receive a paper cup bearing your misspelled name. Coffee was meant to be drank in leisure over conversation while digesting an exquisite meal. The coffee should be meticulously crafted with quality ingredients and served in a cup that's not destined for a recycling bin the moment after you've taken your final sip. It should be enjoyed in an environment that is both lively and without a trace of precipitancy. The right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have, and a wonderful place to spend it is at Caffé Vittoria with spectacular coffee and companionship."
65,55,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/3/2021,"After searching for a aesthetically pleasing coffee shop online, I stumbled upon this one as well as a friend recommending it. It was a busy spot! But was such a cute shop to grab an iced coffee and dessert with some friends."
66,56,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/8/2020,"An old school coffee shop in Boston's North End.

Narrow inside with a few tables, along with outdoor seating. All old school coffee machines, some of which they still use! Service is fast and there is always a barista on hand to take your order. All drinks can be made iced, which is a selling point in my book. No extra charge for soy or almond milk, which is another selling point.

Definitely more of a grab and go type place with excellent coffee and even better prices. Two iced lattes with soy for $4!"

68,58,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,9/4/2021,"We walked in and were coldly greeted with the most unfriendly, dead-mackerel-eyed waitress. The café was not very busy but she obviously hated her job. And humans. She ignored us until we left without giving this place our business. Extremely rude."
69,59,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,7/6/2021,"I come here whenever I bring guests to the North End. It's a cozy, aesthetic place on the popular Hanover Street. 

The gelato is really rich, very delicious. The flavor is concentrated goodness. Everyone always enjoys the gelato. They give you tiny spoons so that you really savor every tiny bite. The drinks that I've had are also great, particularly the iced mocha. 

If you order an ice water, don't expect it to come quickly, but service is otherwise pretty fast. Cash only. I don't think they have prices for anything on the menu but everything drink or gelato that I've had is $4-5."

Tiramisu was very good and the latte was great as well. Not too pricey but note that this place is cash only!

The inside has a louder than coffee shop chatter but lots of seating and really like how they set this place up.

My only caveat here is that the
moment we entered the cafe and while sitting inside the staff were a quite aggressive. Perhaps it was because it was the end of the night and they were ready to close, I don't know but that was not exactly the cafe experience I expected."

GET THE TIRAMISU!

I've had many tiramisus before and have also tried making it myself before too. Lemme tell ya, it's hard to perfect! This place holds #1 for the best tiramisu I've ever had. I tried to pace myself but it was gone in 5 minutes. The cappuccino was great too. Smooth, velvety, foamy on top with a decadent chocolate sauce on top. 

When you enter you can sit down wherever you'd like and someone will help you with your order. After you are done with your food/beverage they will give you a bill. This place is cash only so make sure you have some cash on you!"

I was told this was a must visit if you were in Boston. Coffee is decorated really uniquely, but tastes like your typical coffee. Smooth and not too sweet. We got the cappuccino and mocha. Only downside was that service was very slow, and no one really gave us a heads up about that. We sort of just sat and waited for twenty ish minutes. Also, they don't take card, only cash."

Caffé Vittoria is a North End gem. Step in and you'll be transported to an old-timey Italian coffee shop that looks straight out a movie. The walls are lined with vintage memorabilia and oldies play in the background.

The price point is about right. I usually go for the cappuccino (dusted with cinnamon) and the tiramisu (fluffy and decadent). I tried a bite of my bf's strawberry cheesecake which was good (but surprisingly salty).

Half a star lost for service. Often times, it can be hard to flag down somebody to take your order."
85,75,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,6/19/2019,"A Large Hot Coffee from Caffe Vittoria. Extra Strong. The Stuff will put you on Mars... $3.50 well worth it.

I will have to go to Caffe Vittoria the next time i'm in the North End and try some of their Baked Tasty Goods.. Oh Yeah..!

Caffe Vittoria is also Wheelchair accessible although there is no power door. There is a steep Ramp to the door, so you will need help.

Inside be aware Caffe Vittoria space wise is a bit tight. But there is enough for a wheelchair to navigate the Space and the Staff is very accommodating. 

Note: Caffe Vittoria also has a Hidden tiny Vintage Coffee Museum in the back of the dining room. It's Cool.!"
86,76,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,12/20/2020,"I definitely enjoy caffe Vittoria for the ambiance and location. I prefer other local spots drinks and desserts more, however sometimes you just want a cute spot to sit after dinner and have an espresso and treat. When that feeling hits me, this is my go to spot. The service is fine - unremarkable. The prices are a little high for what you get, but that's probably due to the high rent on the location. Overall, it's definitely worth a stop - I'll leave it up to you if you work it in to your normal rotation."
87,77,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/15/2021,Still the best place for cappuccino or Espresso martinis ... or both.. we opted for both!
88,78,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,12/31/2020,"Must come!! Delicious hot chocolate. Cappuccino, Canolis, and chocolate martini. Every time I come to Boston I have to pass by here. Love the antique look of the place and the service is great too."
89,79,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,1/2/2022,"Best cappuccinos ever!  They were short staffed, so you do need to wait a little, but well worth it. Highly recommend! Servers were very kind."
90,80,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,5/3/2021,"BEWARE! None of the desserts are made in house. This place is a giant tourist trap. I sat and watched as they got a delivery of numerous boxes of Costco pre-made cakes and pastries. I also saw tons of frozen strawberry topping and nesquick. I did a quick google search and saw they won ""best  hot chocolate in Boston""... You all must really like nestle nesquick haha!! You have been warned"
91,81,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,2/14/2022,"We have been here probably 5 times over the years and here are my thoughts. So the 3 stars are for the desserts, everything else here I can do without. The desserts are undeniably the best part of this place. The downside, hectic, extremely noisy, and the tables are on top of each other. When you come here on Friday and Saturday nights it is not well organized when seating people at tables. There are 2 entrances and they allow people to enter in both. We walked in and were taken to a table by the hostess only to find that someone else seated people there or they walked in the other entrance and sat themselves. Service is hit or miss at best, never what I would consider good or great. Along with the service issues I have never met a friendly waitress. No smiles or exchanging pleasantries here. The drinks to me seem to be on the small side and weak. I have never had  coffee drink that I could taste a hint of alcohol. On top of all that it's cash only. If you want a better experience go in the afternoon or week days, avoid the weekend nights or take the desserts to go."
92,82,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,8/13/2021,"Good every time I come here.  I got tiramisu, and it was a little frozen but I understand that they are busy and probably have to cook in large batches and freeze.  Eclair and rum baba were good as well.  It was very busy so service was kind of slow, but again I understand that.  Highly recommend!"
93,83,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/25/2019,"There's something magical about a perfectly made cappuccino. The dusting of cocoa as you take a giant sip and the fluffy foam followed by a strong caffeinated river going down. 

This is the place for a pre dinner capp. Everyone comes to the North End for old school Italian grub. It's an absolute madhouse. You have to be prepared to wait. I would recommend having an espresso beverage before the dinner. While we were there the dinner crowd came stampeding in. 

So happy we got a table towards the front. Perfect for people watching and enjoying the cafe atmosphere. I wish we would have had room for dessert. The cannolis and the tiramisu looked mouth watering. 

I don't know what happened to modern day cafes but the legit old school Italian joint are unbeatable."
94,84,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,5/10/2021,"If you really want to die, go to Caffe vittotia. We found mold in our dessert! Mold!! How long was it there for? We don't know but our experience was so unpleasant that it almost made me vomit. The waitress offered an apology and she was ok. It was not her fault. However, the manager's attitude was like 'meh.. this happens frequently' ... he got this off the bill and we still paid for the other desserts and drinks we had. Are you kidding? We will avoid this place like the plague. What a disgrace."
95,85,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,11/30/2020,"Cafe Vittoria is a consummate Italian cafe with decorations spanning decades. The staff are very helpful and friendly, and the food is absolutely amazing!"
96,86,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,1/22/2020,"BC I'm basic and follow Thrillist like the bible, I succumbed to their recommendation to visit Cafe Vittoria. They describe the front door as almost a teleport, transporting visitors to a cafe in Italy itself. Well, I like to travel. I hope customs isn't strict bc my passport is currently in the possession of the USPS for renewal. 

There is a slight culture shock inside the place. The decor is unusual and quirky. We took a seat at one of their little cafe tables near a nook which has a mural of some Italian scene on it. I didn't inspect it because I was facing the other way and there were tables against the wall so that felt awkward to me. 

The menu has a ton of cafe beverages, as you probably expected. I, again being basic, ordered a cappuccino. The gelato case near the entrance put the idea of ice cream in my head and I conveniently remembered that it's been AGES since I've had sorbet. We went with mango. Finally, my GF brought their pastries to my attention. Lobster tail caught my attention. What the fuck is that doing on a pastry menu? I then received an education and for the sake of completion, had to try it of course. 

The waitresses were a bit bitchy, NGL. I took one for the team and ordered everything so my little lobster tail only ordered a glass of water which classically never came. 

The cappuccino was incredible. One of the best I've had in a long time. It was incredibly creamy and rich with a hint of chocolate (unless I'm hallucinating). The sorbet was very sweet but smooth and DELICIOUS. The lobster tail crust was flaky and crunchy. The cream inside was thick without being too heavy with a touch of sweetness. I couldn't decide whether I wanted to eat the dough or the cream more. I kept becoming overwhelmed with the richness of the pastry and halting my consumption but I kept coming back for more. It was actually so intense that I had planned all week to go to Magnolia later for one of their infamous banana puddings but literally had zero desire for any further dessert for the rest of the day. 

This is a GEM. Every trip to Boston requires a visit to this place and the espresso beverages are a must."
97,87,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,5/27/2019,"Boy do I wish this place existed for me back home. I absolutely LOVED the ambiance and setting of this cozy cafe. The space is small, intimate, and bustling with happy diners enjoying amazing pastries and coffees. You must try the cannoli - it is to die for. Best I've ever had! 

The spot is cash only, so be prepared!"
98,88,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,12/28/2019,"So I came here to just a slice of teramisu to go. First off, the customer service was a little rude. We were standing by the bar to order, and no one was paying attention to take our order. When a waitress finally asked what we wanted, she told one of the kids behind the bar to give it to us and take our payment. This kid wasn't even paying attention with his iPod buds in his ear. I waved him down at the counter and asked him what the cost was. 

He gave me the wrong change so I asked him what the cost was again showing the change, and he just stared as if I was crazy. After going back and forth multiple times, I ended up just letting it go. 

The teramisu wasn't very impressive either. Never coming back here again.

Don't think it's worth coming here."
99,89,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,7/3/2021,This place is as Italian as it gets! Authentic cappuccinos/lattes and pastries. Nice touch with adding cocoa powder to the top of the cappuccino. Fantastic.
100,0,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,11/24/2021,"Really good spot on Hanover street. 
This wasn't the first place I wanted to try when I moved to the neighborhood. I think this was because the sign kinda looks like a Mexican place and then it's Italian so my brain was a little confused. 
Well... it was delicious. My bolognese was so good and we got a nice bottle of red to split as well. Our waitress was so nice and the place is adorable on the inside. 
Awesome spot for a low key Italian dinner in the north end!"
101,1,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,2/27/2022,"Tried Cantina Italiana for dinner a few weeks ago and was excited by the reviews! The service was decent, just wanted to give a shout out to the waiters that refilled our waters, they were really on top of it and I don't think my cup ever went empty. 

We got the Nutella martini, the bolognese and the salmon pasta dish. For the Nutella martini it was interesting but I feel like the alcohol in it was a bit overwhelming and the cocktail was a bit messy in that it was dripping on the side of the cup and my hands got really sticky. 

As for the pasta dishes the salmon was well cooked and the pasta noodles were also well cooked. However the sauces were very subpar, the bolognese didn't really have that meaty flavor that I was hoping for.

Overall the experience was decent but I'm not sure that the food taste and quality measured up to the price we paid."
102,2,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,2/4/2022,"I wasn't blown away by this place but it's nice in the inside, has a nice bar area and my food was good enough to be a 4. My issue was the service was terrible. I'll admit I was in for an early dinner, like 4PM, and they all seemed distracted by setting up for the dinner rush than paying any attention to the couple early customers they had already, including me. Not sure the issue but every step was slow, getting me a menu, getting me a drink, ordering, my food coming out, refilling my drink and getting my check when I was done. Everything was slow it was like I was invisible. At one point I just wanted another drink and I literally couldn't even get the bartender to glance at me for 10 minutes. 

The food, albeit a long wait, was solid. Nothing spectacular and plenty better in the North End but good. I especially liked the pasta fagioli soup I got before my meal. Again, had I gotten a little attention in the service I probably would give it a 4. Maybe just an off night as far as that goes? Unsure."
103,3,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,11/16/2021,"Scored a 6pm reservation for 4 for a celebratory dinner. When we arrived we were quickly seated at a small booth. Luckily we were able to move to a slightly more spacious table towards the back, though be prepared to be in close quarters with other parties. They really want it to feel like you're eating at grandma'a house here, so try to get comfortable. 

We started with a few spritz cocktails and the calamari and the prosciutto mozzarella appetizers. The drinks were tasty and not too strong. The calamari was a verrry small portion for the cost, but pretty tasty. The prosciutto and mozzarella was pretty basic. Just exactly as described. The waiter was frequently asking if we were ready to order entrees, so we appeased him and did.

For mains, we all ended up with bombolotti dishes. Mine included the lobster tail, shrimp and tomato sauce. Pretty tasty, though not very spicy as he warned. The shells were on both the shrimp and lobster. The pasta shape is a fun treat, but overall the portions weren't big enough to satisfying the hungry men in my party. 

Overall not a very classy celebration I hoped for, felt rushed by the waiter, but was fun to try a historic pasta dish in the North End."
104,4,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,9/23/2021,"We popped in here for a drink and an appetizer. 
If you're looking for an amazing bruschetta and a refreshing cocktail, this is the spot. 

I loved their outside dining, but we sat in the bar for a cool down. 

I'm so glad we picked this spot."
105,5,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,12/13/2021,"This was a great place to go on a Saturday night for some great italian food. I loved this place! The service was great and the pasta was very authentic. I also got an espresso martini and that was perfect. You have to make a reservation or else you are not going to get a seat. I made one about two weeks prior so I definitely recommend getting in your reservation ASAP!
Ambiance is great and it was fun to be in the North End."
106,6,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,6/4/2021,"We specifically chose this restaurant due to its long standing history in the North End and are happy we did.  We landed here 2/3rds into our Freedom Trail walk.  It was early afternoon on a weekday so not too busy and we were probably all tourists!  We were seated immediately and brought water (score).  It is hard to explain, but bringing me water right away always sets a positive tone to my dining experience... might also have been that we had been walking for a couple hours and I was thirsty!

We ordered some Calamari, a Caesar salad and a couple of dishes -- the Cioppino and Gnocchi al Forno (with shrimp).  SO delicious... ALL of it.  I absolutely loved the Caesar Salad -- when done right and with homemade dressing that is not too heavy it is perfection and they nailed it.  We had the Tiramisu for dessert and that too was fantastic."
107,7,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,11/8/2021,"Fantastic  food wine and service in a building that hasn't been remodeled in decades. Remember your here for the food, not the ambiance - everything came out fresh and delicious! Our server Omar was a pro and handled everything with ease!"
108,8,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,3/5/2021,"Food was average or slightly above among north end restaurants.  We added $7 or so for half portion of the truffle gnocchi, which turned out to be the best (both taste and value). 

What was concerning was the practice during the pandemic.  MA and Boston requires 25% maximum capacity and 90min limited dining time. Cantina is for sure not enforcing either."
109,9,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,1/31/2021,"Dined here last night. Fatima helped us--she's very nice and provide great recommendations.

Cantina Italians is advertised to be the oldest restaurant in the North End--we'll take it. Worth trying considering the ease of reservation and decent reviews on Yelp, as well as on other platforms. 

Food was delicious. See pictures. 

As for pandemic handling (12/30/2021) - One concern we have is whether the restaurant actually comply with the 25% max capacity. We were one of the first guests, but when we were done, almost every table was occupied. It did not look like 25% max capacity to us. They might've overbooked or did not turn newer customers away when arrived.  Place was, I must say, really crowded. Menu should be switched to 1-time used paper menu rather than reusable plastic menus. Plus side, there's hand sanitizer on every table."
110,10,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,2/5/2022,"Good authentic Italian North End spot! Great food, reasonable prices and out standing service"
111,11,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,11/1/2020,"After living out of state for the last two years I was really excited to return and enjoy a meal in the North End. The experience is a little different now due to the increased outdoor seating on the already crowded streets, but generally the good food and old-fashioned italian vibes are still there. I enjoyed my meal at Cantina Italiana aside from a few small hiccups, including a large party of loud birthday-celebrators (which was not the restaurant's fault but stricter limitations on group size/noise level would be appreciated). In general I was a little surprised at how close together the tables were inside the restaurant, given the current social distancing guidance.

Not every pasta dish on their menu contains pasta handmade on site (understandable given their size), so I specifically tried the Bombolotti Alla Buongustaia because it was described as their signature house-made pasta with handmade sausage. All the flavors together were SO tasty and that house-made bombolotti was in fact bomb. Definitely would get this again!

I also tried the Scialatelle with Salmon, also described on the menu as house-made. The pasta itself was good, but unfortunately the sauce was lackluster. It was salvaged by adding salt to bring out the mild flavor that was there, but really could have used some more robust seasoning."
112,12,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,1/4/2022,"We had a great experience at dinner tonight with our server Omar! He was fun and very polite! We have came here several times and he always is very nice and personable with us, even when it is very busy! We would definitely come back here again. The food is amazing as well as the service!"
113,13,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,4/11/2021,"This is not the place to be if you're looking to get martinis. Started with a cosmopolitan that came out sweet and nothing like what it's supposed to taste like. Espresso martini was on the lighter side with almost no espresso just a lot of baileys. 
They need a better system put in place for hectic weekend nights. I watched our appetizers be brought to multiple tables before getting to us. 
The truffle fries & prosciutto and mozz were the only things I would recommend getting. 
As plates were being brought out, the cacio e Pepe looked yummy but actually was the opposite. Noodles were too hard and the plate was warm so the cheese was getting sticky. Little to no taste, would not recommend."
114,14,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,10/24/2021,They made me a custom spaghetti and clam sauce a mix between red and white. It was so good better then I expected i would highly recommend it. my waiter Manny was excellent
115,15,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,9/6/2021,"This review is about the very messed up person who takes reservations and seats you, we didn't even make it  inside the restaurant because of her aggression towards us. We didn't feel safe going in because she was physically aggressive. If you catch her on a bad day she might end up ruining your evening so bear that in mind while making a reservation at this place. There are multiple reviews calling her out and I've never been treated this horribly anywhere so am gonna take the good money I was about to drop here, to so many other incredible places in the area.

We went there on a super busy night were walking to the check in counter outside the restaurant on the pavement when I saw a crazy lady yelling at the long line of customers waiting patiently and adhering to social distancing. *she did not have a mask on and was yelling so much her  spittle was flying at people*. She was unraveling and clearly needed to be sat down and taken care of or given a break to collect herself as she was abusing everyone at the restaurant and creating a huge scene outside ruining the experience of the people who had gotten in and were looking for a nice evening. 

We walked up to get to check in and instead of explaining the next steps and where to wait she started yelling at us without understanding that we were just looking to her guidance. I am still shaking and can't make sense of anything that happened. We just walked off after she started spitting at us because my family's health is paramount and no meal is worth contracting covid."
116,16,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,9/25/2021,"We made a reservation for 8:15 but weren't seated until 9:00pm and weren't fed until 10:00pm. Pasta was good and portions were large, but the wait was too long! If there weren't a wait, it'd be a 4.5/5 instead.

PS - ambiance is homey but loud"
117,17,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,3/20/2022,"So far the worst place we have been to in the North End. We had a reservation, but there was no table for us (~30min wait outside). The worst, however, was the food: the least authentic pasta carbonara with cream (why?!) and almost no bacon for the amount of pasta, and the cacio e peppe was basically just plain pasta with a few ungrounded pepper corns. But that was not all. The wine (Barbera) was undrinkable and the prosecco was completely flat like a white wine. How on Earth can this place survive?! There are so many gems out there in the North End (Carmelina's, Giacomo's, Neptune, ...), just don't waste your time or money here..."
118,18,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,12/27/2021,We dined at Cantina Italianna on Christmas Day. I ordered Saltimbiccq Chicken - pan seared chicken and sautéed with foraged mushrooms in a marsala wine sauce topped with Prosciutto di Parma and mozzarella. The dish was great. Bigger portion compared to those served in New York.
119,19,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,11/27/2021,"We had a reservation, they told us that reservations are first come first serve. Sorry what is the point of a reservation? This place is a fucking scam why do you have reservations if they're not reserved for people who actually made them. Host staff is just as useless and unaccomdating. We were one minute late after getting a text that said our table was ready and by the time we got there they already gave our table away. Their  host was laughing at us. I hope you all choke on your meatballs."
120,20,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,11/27/2021,I would give them 0 stars if I could. We had a reservation at 7:30 and we got to the hostess stand and the hostess said our reservations don't necessarily mean that you will be seated at that time and that we would have to show up within ten minutes once we were notified that our table was ready... we waited patiently for the table and were texted that our table was ready and when we walked over within 30 seconds... they gave away our table. This restaurant has the most unprofessional hostess who also chose to laugh at the situation when we were waiting in below freezing temperatures for over 30 minutes.
121,21,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,6/17/2021,"I literally have never been as disappointed as this meal.   The location was recommended by locals, and even our hotel.  
Each sauce tasted the exact same (alla vodka / spaghetti sauce) and the noddles were over cooked and mushy.  
We hoped for fresh hot bread at the table, and that was not the case.  
It was the ONLY meal during our five days in Boston that we regretted.  It still upsets me that we spent $145 for a family of four on what we hoped would have been our favorite meal."
122,22,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,7/12/2021,"This was amazing restaurant as the meal was full of flavor, and cooked perfectly. The device was attentive and joyful. Highly recommend this great place. Also not overpriced, worth every penny!"
123,23,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,7/6/2021,"We thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience here! Was it the best Italian food I've ever had? No, but it was incredibly delicious and everyone was happy. We had the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer, lasagna, fettuccine carbonara, vodka sauce and spaghetti in my group. Generous portion sizes! The service was excellent too. They were out of bread but then told us they called local bakeries to see what they could find for us. It just showed they cared. Some of the outdoor tables were slanted and I saw two different cocktail glasses slide off the table and shatter."
124,24,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,9/18/2021,We got there not too long after they opened so there was no wait. All of the staff was very friendly and attentive. Our waitress was funny and enjoyable. The food was delicious and did not take long to get.

The ultimate goal - find the best Italian food in the north end. We succeeded. Cantina Italiana was, quite literally, the best I've ever had. And we have to give the goddess who makes this place run so beautifully SO MUCH love. Maria Delvecchio is an absolute queen. She made our visit so incredibly special. We love you, Maria. We'll see again you soon, Cantina Italiana!"

128,28,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,10/10/2021,"WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!

This is only my second review, so bear with me...  No reservations and while second in  line, we witnessed a bitter, old hostess/owner berating a server and then complaining about her to the first in line customers.  We were told 10-15 minutes for a table.  After 30 minutes of people watching (the location IS great) and hearing the hostess saying there was no wait, I asked and we were immediately seated. My first WETF.  The berating continued...  Imagine eating at a ""quaint Italian restaurant and hearing yelling from the hostess, ""YOU GOTTA KEEP THE AC ON!  YOU GOTTA KEEP THE AIR FLOWING!  Or ""WE GOT A PARTY OF 13 COMING IN!  DO THIS AND THIS AND THAT!""  My second WTF.

I was embarrassed for myself.  Why didn't I speak up?  ""STOP OPENLY CRITISIZING YOUR STAFF TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!  WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENJOY A NIGHT OUT!  And/or ""COULD YOU KEEP IT DOWN WHILE WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENJOY A MEAL OUT?"" 

The food?  Poor at best.  Maybe it was what we ordered.  The $35 veal was dry and tasteless, the pasta was overcooked and miniscule (isn't pasta cheap?) and the sauce tasted burnt.  My ultimate WFT.

Other than our server, EVERYTHING SUCKED!!!"

130,30,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,11/3/2021,My wife and I got lucky when we chose this restaurant! This is a true North End gem. The restaurant is very authentic and the food and wine were excellent. If you are ever in Boston make sure that you go there for a nice dinner!
131,31,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,9/19/2021,"Service was delayed but food was solid! Waited 30mjn past our reservation to be seated and 35 minutes after ordering for food (nothing too crazy on a Saturday night). Mariana our server was friendly. Hostess definitely was not, but she was able to manage the large amount of folks waiting for their tables so it was effective. For the price and atmosphere, maybe I'd try somewhere else when I return to the North End, but being able to make a reservation was a plus."
132,32,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,12/8/2019,"The North End is filled with its hits and misses, sprinkled in between the classics like Mike's Pastry and Vittoria Cafe, but Cantina is a total home run in my carb-loving book of Best Italian Eats. I came here for my birthday dinner and it's like being transported to old Italy -- you walk into the sounds of Italian being spoken, smell the comforting zing of tomato sauce, and imagine someone's nonna cooking up a homemade pasta dish for you. There's a certain charm to the whole place that I haven't really found replicated in any other restaurant in Little Italy. 

Maybe it's the booths -- being seated in one puts you in a little world of your own, where despite it being super busy / a packed house, you feel like you can have an intimate conversation with your table, and savor over all the dishes you ordered together, sharing pieces of your dish with your friends and family, just like you'd imagine a homey Italian dinner.

We were on a time crunch with tickets to a show, but somehow our (amazingly efficient / sweet) waiter was able to work with the kitchen to get our dishes out quickly and impeccably cooked. 

I had the Bombolotti alla Buongustaia (Bombolotti pasta, spicy Italian sausage, fresh basil, marinara sauce, parmigiano), while we shared a few apps I can barely recall since we devoured them so quickly. I had never had bombolotti, but this was hands down my favorite of everything we ordered. The pasta was cooked SO perfectly, and that sauce! Suffice to say, I'll never train for a sprint or a marathon, but I can proudly say I can devour a multi-course Italian meal in under 45 minutes. Which should be record-holding, in some country, I'm sure. 

It's generally impossible to get my niece to a) eat her dinner or b) talk to any strangers, and she literally left hi-fiving the waiter and saying how amazing the spaghetti was, so home run it is:)."
133,33,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,9/26/2021,It won't let me leave a 1/2 star but these people SUCK SUCK SUCK Had us wait 40 minutes for a table then after an hour of waiting for our food they came to us to say they lost the ticket and no one made our food. AND they wouldn't rush it so it would be another 30-40 minutes and suggested we go eat somewhere else!! I literally hate you people.
134,34,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,8/29/2021,"Not a great experience. For starters, none of the waitstaff nor the hostess were wearing masks. They didn't even acknowledge it when we all had ours on. The Covid test positivity rate is 6.4% in the North End right now...
Beyond our fears that we were contracting Covid, we were disappointed in the service and the food. The drinks came quickly enough, but we waited a full hour for our food. The pasta fagioli soup had nearly any flavor. We never got the parm cheese we requested. The spaghetti and meatballs were very average and the spaghetti was slightly hard. The worst part, however, was the gnocchi. It was undercooked and the insides were powdery and dry. We were definitely disappointed overall, and the bill was huge and felt entirely not worth the $. Sad because it was our last big night out in the North End and we wished we had gone back to Monica! Next time..."
135,35,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,11/25/2021,I haven't been there since I left Massachusetts the food it was delicious the service was fantastic the place brought back so many memories.
136,36,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,12/27/2021,"For being an Italian restaurant in the North End this was just ok. I ordered penne arrabbiata, the sauce itself had fine taste but it was not spicy at all and there were slices of jalapeño peppers in the dish. I love jalapeños but the menu said nothing about them and they're not traditionally in an arrabbiata sauce. I'm giving our waitress the benefit of the doubt and assuming based on service she was very new. She only listed 1 special while the table behind us heard 4 specials from their waiter, she told us there was no more soup and we watched multiple tables (who were seated after us) get delivered the same soup we asked for...maybe it was just an off night for them. If you're looking for an old school Italian feel this restaurant definitely has that vibe."
137,37,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,12/17/2021,"Originally, they were accommodating and took us 20 minutes late from our reservation. The food was great and we had a great time. As we were finishing our drinks, we were told we needed to hurry up and were rushed out of the restaurant. Did not appreciate the lack of accommodation to us finishing up our drinks and dinner."
138,38,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,10/16/2021,"Quite the crowd outside waiting for a table at 7 pm  Dined here last night while vacationing in Boston.  As good as any place in little italy in NY.  Very good apps, pasta and veal entrees and attentive service."
139,39,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,10/26/2021,One of the best Italian restaurants we ate at on our recent trip to Boston. Delicious food and their fresh soft pasta is always a plus.  The hostess was hilarious and the ambience was relaxed yet refined. Cannot wait to return to get more pasta
140,40,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,7/18/2021,We went here for my wife's Birthday and while the food was great the overall experience was not great.  The woman working at the outdoor desk told me check in for the reservation was at the bar which it was not it ended up being at the outdoor desk. The same lady came up to me when I was going back to the check in and grabbed me very inappropriately. I asked for a manager and the worker I asked introduced me to Omar as a manager.  Omar was very apologetic but the lady seemed to not care at all. When we finally checked in for our reservation the workers out there were apologetic. My point is if you are going to spend $$$ on a nice night out don't roll the dice on possibly getting a lady who is going to be rude with unwelcome touching.  It's sad because for special dinners this was our place for the past 6 years and now it's not.
141,41,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,7/31/2021,Do not order from this restaurant on any food courier app. The food was absolutely appalling. I never knew salmon could have a rubbery texture until I ordered from here today. The food was not packaged correctly therefore it did not taste fresh nor did it look appetizing. I ended up trashing $80 worth of food. Don't waste your money.
142,42,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,7/12/2020,"It feels great to be back in the North End!  Came here for a Friday night meal with some friends and we loved it.  Come while the weather is great and grab a seat outside.  

I was with a group of three, and we started with the Polpette meatballs and they were fantastic.  Conveniently they came with three, one for each of us in the party.  The food comes out quickly and hot.  For my main dish, I ordered the Cacio E Pepe and it was fantastic.  I'm a bit biased because this is my favorite pasta dish, but WOW!  Not only were they heavy on the cheese, the dish had whole black peppercorns in it.  I went halfsies on Pappardelle Bolognese with my friend, and again, that was also great.  The pasta was fresh, light, and cooked perfectly al dente.  

Great spot to hit with family or friends.  They have a great cocktail selection (they make a mean espresso martini), and a good assortment of Italian wines.  All the waiters were in masks, and they had hand sanitizers at each table.  Overall great experience, can't wait to go again."
143,43,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,11/27/2021,hostess was horrible. Reservation didn't mean anything. laughed in our faces as we waited patiently

145,45,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,7/11/2021,"Seats were all broken, one cheek on concrete, one cheek in an abyss of loose, ripped leather. Watered down drinks, as in you order drinks and receive water. Pathetic risotto, and oil drenched spinach. Salmon was crispy and good, but that's only if you're willing to wait an hour for food. Disappointment of a lifetime. Would rather eat plane food, which is actually good these days. At least it wasn't too expensive. Don't waste your time."
146,46,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,7/4/2021,Horrible spaghetti and even worse lasagna. It was the worst  Italian food I've ever had.  Long wait as well.  I sent back the lasagna to the kitchen. There are better options for Italian. Avoid!
147,47,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,6/14/2020,"So excited to dine in the North End again! Props to Cantina Italiana for serving their full menu, both food and drink, despite the reduction in tables from the pandemic. The outdoor seating is a little closer than other places I've seen due to limited real estate on Hanover Street, but I felt and that everyone out was keeping respectable distances.

The staff was fantastic, our waiter was very attentive and gave great recommendations. They gave us fresh bread and oil for the table. I ordered a Harry's Bellini to drink and the Bombolotti alla Buongustaia pasta dish for my lunch. I would recommend both, I was completely satisfied with my meal. The pasta is a heavy dish that came out in a sizzling hot pan with layers of gooey goat cheese and spicy sausage baked in. I'll definitely be back!"
148,48,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,10/2/2019,"Delicious food but unfortunately also an extremely long wait to get said food!

I came with two friends on a Sunday night and we were seated immediately, but our food took more than 30 minutes to be served. Perhaps this was exacerbated by the fact that we sat right next to where the food comes out of the kitchen so we were disappointed many times as servers came out with food but it wasn't ours.

In addition, my friend somehow got a half order instead of a full order. The bad news is that as a result the full order took an additional 10 minutes to come out (the other two of us were almost done with our food by the time his full order came out). The good news is that the waitress was able to get him an extra large order as compensation.

I had the shrimp scampi and would definitely recommend it to anyone who comes here. The noodles are well cooked and the sauce is well flavored -- not too salty or oily but still flavorful.

Besides food taking a long time to be served, service was good. We had complimentary bread and our waters were refilled promptly throughout the meal.

I would give this place another try but only if I have a lot of time to spare and good company to come with."
149,49,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,6/4/2021,"Don't go here. Super unsanitary, lipstick stain on the glass. Told our waitress and she said it's happened 6x this week!! Food is mediocre at best, I can make it better myself and I'm not even Italian. Don't go here."
150,50,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,7/8/2020,"This was one of the few restaurants that was not packed in North End on a weekend night! For that I am grateful, the pasta was good although the service could be better. We were seated in a place that was hard to see, so it wasn't too big of a deal. The flavors weren't too strong, but I didn't mind and overall I would come again!"
151,51,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,8/25/2021,"Good solid offering in the North End.  We were a group of 4.  We arrived around 5pm on a Tuesday.  We were able to get an outdoor table.  

In general, service was good, other than not clearing away the appetizer plates before the main course arrived, which made us do some gymnastics with plates.  Otherwise, we were provided bread, water glasses were regularly filed, drinks/refills from the bar arrived on-time.  The waitress checked on us often as expected and meals/courses arrived hot.

Food was very good.  Portions were appropriate.  Nobody in our group left unhappy or hungry.  

I would certainly return.  Nothing significant to complain about.  Perfect, no, but very good yes."
152,52,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,10/17/2021,"I couldn't decide whether to give this place 2 or 3 stars. We had an 8:30 reservation on a Saturday night. After telling the hostess we had a reservation, she pointed at a line to stand on. After about 20 minutes, we asked how long the line will take. The same hostess said there were no lines and we had to check in, after pointing us to a line and not asking to check us in before. Later on, without any provocation, she tells me I am acting rude and that will not help her get us a table any sooner. It's good to note at this point there were 2 girls who had been sitting with their check waiting for someone to collect their cards for about 30 minutes. Right in front of the hostess's face. Anyway, after another few minutes on line, the hostess came up to me and started telling me it's not her fault the restaurant is packed and then she grabbed both my cheeks and pinched them. (Covid?) Again, whatever, just trying to get inside and enjoy some food. 
We finally got seated in the way back of the restaurant right next to the kitchen. The kitchen door slammed loudly about every 45 seconds. It took forever to get our wine and the prosciutto and mozz was nothing special. My main course of steak had a sauce that tasted exactly like this chicken sauce I make that I found online. It's a good thing it's a delicious sauce! Our dessert drink, a Nutella martini, was delicious. The pasta dishes were creative shapes and cooked perfectly, but the vodka sauce was nothing special. Throughout the meal, the hostess who I imagine is also the manager, would walk throughout the restaurant rearranging tables. When talking to a server she dropped a very loud F bomb while yelling at him. When they would rearrange tables, they paid no mind to the patrons sitting around, bumping into them with the chairs they were moving. Our waitress was very sweet though. On second thought, i don't know why I even thought of 3 stars. Definitely 2 stars. Terrible service and atmosphere, but the food was pretty good."
153,53,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,12/29/2021,My experience was terrible. My water glass looked as if someone's lip prints were on it. The service was terrible. I'm still waiting for the bread to be brought to my table. Part of the ceiling looked as if it was going to fall. My chicken dish had a ton of oregano. It is definitely off my list.
154,54,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,12/27/2021,Amazing food and drinks but the service was super slow - still will go back though!!! Highly recommend anything with truffle or their house made pasta!! Loved the espresso martinis!!
155,55,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,3/31/2021,"We are so glad to have happened upon this spot for dinner with our family of four. They were incredibly accommodating and welcomed us (even with two young children) warmly. Not only was the service attentive, the food was excellent. Even a simple pasta with marinara for our children was wonderfully seasoned and you could tell the sauce had been cooked down for hours. The salmon was a hit with the entire family and our starters of broccoli and mushrooms were some of the best we have had. We highly recommend. It made our North End evening (and it's right down the street from Mike's, which was a score)!"
156,56,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,3/28/2020,"Excellent dinner all around beginning with the service.

Everyone's meals ranged from very good to terrific. I got the terrific one!  Mine was fusili boscaila (pardon the spelling) - pasta with sausage and greens. The overall dish came together in a fine combination of flavor.

This restaurant features a healthy wine list ranging from about $35 a bottle to $150. Dinner ranged form about $20-$35 but mostly in the low 20s. 

Did I mention the large dessert drink selection? Love it.

I would absolutely come back!"
157,57,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,10/17/2021,We had reservations for 8:30 didn't get sat until around 9:20. Would not recommend for someone who would find this irritating or inconvenient.
158,58,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,3/28/2021,"Worst experience I've ever had in the North End. Don't bother making a reservation because they won't honor it.

We had a reservation for 8 pm and had to wait outside because of Covid rules (not a problem). The hostess was rude and unprofessional and was taking people based on how big their party was - saying they could seat a party of 6 that just showed up because that was the table size they had available (we were a party of 2). She wasn't using any of the party names and it was visibly confusing to everyone waiting outside. It made no sense and was basically first come first serve. So we were sat around 8:45 pm.

The reason we came here is because the website showed they were serving the Dine Out Boston menu even on Saturdays. Our waitress said they weren't, and when I told her they had been advertising it she said she ""didn't really know"". 

Their Covid procedures are also spotty. We were in a corner RIGHT next to a party at the bar. Capacity limits have been lifted in Massachusetts but tables are still supposed to be six feet apart. Most here weren't. They also let us order drinks and leave without ordering food (which we were happy about because we didn't want to order off the regular menu) but that's also illegal.

There are plenty of places in the North End you can get friendly service and great food - so don't bother with here."
159,59,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,3/20/2021,"Worst experience I've had at a restaurant in the North End. 

Overall, the staff seemed quite nice, but the managers were not, and the restaurant itself seemed incredibly poorly run. With all the great options in the North End; I'd say to avoid this one at all costs.

I planned on coming here for Dineout Boston. My girlfriend checked ahead that they had their Dineout Boston menu available for Saturday's, and the website confirmed they did. So, I booked a reservation for 6:15. We got there for 6:10 with a conglomerate of people standing outside waiting. I thought, ""Oh, good thing I made a reservation before had."" But, when I went to check in with the manager, she told me, rather rudely, to step aside and step-down as she wanted to get a group of people in after essentially scolding me for nothing. She apologized, then went inside. The kind woman at the front desk then checked me in. 

We had to wait until 6:45 before FINALLY getting the 6:15 table I reserved. As soon as we were seated, we told the waitress we wanted the Dineout Boston menu. She then had to walk over to the same manager from earlier, and we heard the manager say they weren't doing that menu tonight. We then discussed with a separate manager how the website specially says the Dineout Boston is listed as a option today; only to be told tough luck. So, we left. 

We have a sneaking suspicion that they purposely overbook people and had that Dineout menu listed even though it wasn't available, just to get people in the door and force a Sunk Cost fallacy on them to stay and order far more expensive food."
160,60,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/19/2021,"I booked a business dinner for 16 out of towners.   I have heard nothing but raves about the experience and the food.    The staff is very attentive and every detail was taken care of.   This was the perfect ""North End Experience"" without a crazy, over the top price.  

Thank you!"
161,61,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/17/2021,The service was amazing and very quick! The food came in large portion sizes and were very flavorful. Highly recommend the pasta dishes along with the calamari! There are both indoor (with open windows) and outdoor seating.
162,62,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/17/2021,"Delicious food! Our waitress was lovely but a little slow with service but the food was outstanding! We started with peach bellinis, cosmos and the bruschetta. Both cocktails were amazing and the bruschetta was some of the best i've ever had. Each piece had individual balls of mozzarella and the tomatoes were marinated in a touch of balsamic and olive oil. I ordered a dish with pesto, burrata and pine nuts served in a pan. It was delicious!! My friends ordered the carbonara and chicken parm. Both equally delicious and the carbonara was my favorite! We will be returning, hopefully soon!"
163,63,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,10/12/2021,Well what can I say. You would think that I. Little Italy in Boston you could get good food. Not at this place. Service was good but my bolognese had absolutely no flavor.  I make a better sauce by far. My husbands scampi was bland also.
164,64,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,9/12/2021,"I rarely write reviews unless something is outstanding.  This was such a bad embarrassing experience that I am making an exception.

We were visiting Boston and wanted an authentic Italian dinner in the North End.  The hotel concierge made reservations.  We had guests - Close family friends who've been in Boston for 2 years for law school with a 7 month old.  Three of us got out of the car to let them know we were there for our reservation and let us know where my husband could park the car - as we didn't know there was no parking - we are from out of state. When we walked up the Hostess was screaming at two waitresses - belittling them in front of all the restaurant guests who were sitting outside.  After a few moments we asked her where to park and she chewed our heads off.  We said here for our reservation and she yelled at my guests for standing on the sidewalk being in the way of her waiter.  If the restaurants around us hadn't looked over crowded and we hadn't had a 7 month old with us, I would have walked away.  She continued to berate staff throughout the evening and continued her absolute rudeness to us through out.  When our waiter did not come back for almost 30 minutes we asked her to send over our waiter and she screamed that we sent him away.  Which we did by asking him to give us a minute to look at the menu but not 20-30 minutes.  

Once we ordered and the food finally came - all of the dishes were bland and the sauces all tasted like the same dish.  The ""homemade"" pasta noodles were gooey and somewhat stuck together.  And the noise was so loud we could barely hear ourselves talk and had to keep asking the waiter to repeat himself.  The cost for this rude experience and mediocre food was about $180 for four people with no alcohol ordered.  Just 4 pasta dishes, 1 salad, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert. +$24 to park at the Waterfront.  I asked the kids who had been living in Boston - is this an Italian thing, a Boston thing, or is this lady as rude I think.  The answer -  Just her - VERY RUDE HOSTESS; VERY OVERPRICED; VERY MEDIOCRE FOOD. DON""T WASTE YOUR EVENING."
165,65,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,3/28/2021,"Nothing special going on here . They try , service was good , but it's the type of food you get at a pizza joint . Had to pay $25 to park , which is probably what my dinner was worth ( for two people). Had the Pesto ( very dry ), caprisse salad ( mozzarella and tomatoes cut way to thick )and cannoli. Don't believe the hype . They are trying I give them that ."
166,66,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,1/25/2019,"WOW! What an amazing Italian restaurant located in the North End of Boston! We found this place after doing our research on Yelp (of course!), and we are glad we did! I would definitely recommend reservations, as they are pretty busy on most nights. We did have to wait a little bit even though we had a reservation, but it was worth it. 

The host really made us feel like we were in an authentic Italian restaurant. He was very friendly and his accent was everything! We sat in a cute little booth that had coat hangers on the end (a first for me, being from Florida). Our waitress was little flustered, but we didn't take it personally and still enjoyed our meal. 

I enjoyed a glass of wine, while my boyfriend tried their mule and a bourbon spice. He said he wouldn't get the bourbon spice again, but the mule was great. I ordered the gnocchi, and let me tell you it was the best one I have ever had. It was made in house and the sauce was just to die for. My boyfriend got the spaghetti with red sauce, and he said the fresh pasta was perfect. 

We were too full for dessert, but they do have a promising menu. Overall, amazing Italian restaurant with authentic cuisine. You can't go wrong with this place!"
167,67,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,8/28/2020,"4.5
Very well spaced outdoor dining area (considering the whole situation with COVID-19). The food was phenomenal and the waiter was very attentive. My only issue was with the portion size: the plates were huge which made the actual food look tiny. The gnocchi that I ordered was fantastic but seemed way too little for 26 dollars. Other than that, everything else was amazing, I highly recommend visiting!"
168,68,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,8/22/2020,"I made a reservation in advance for 8:30pm on a Friday night for a special occasion. Upon arrival we were told to wait in line as it was ""First come first serve"", according to the manager. We ended up waiting for half an hour, in the same line with people who didn't make a reservation at all. (I wasn't even asked for my name for verification) 
After waiting in the heat for 30 minutes, the evening was pretty much ruined.
It is very wrong and misleading for a restaurant to make themselves open to reservations, when they do not appreciate them. 
The food was average and the service was remarkably slow. 
I personally had a very disappointing experience here, which had nothing to do with COVID-19.
I would not recommend this place to anyone."
169,69,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,6/27/2021,"We had gnocchi with calamari, eggplant parm, broccoli rabe, shrimp arriabata. Everything was divine! The summer Sam Adams brew was refreshing on a hot day. Excellent service."

172,72,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,8/25/2021,"Horrible flavor.
I grew up in Italy and generally avoid Italian restaurants in the U.S. because I find that they often do not replicate the authentic flavors I'm used to.
I ordered a salad and a special, Risotto Milanese, a favorite of mine.
The salad was a unceremonious mess of iceberg, thick cucumber medallions, cherry tomatoes, pickled onions, and some creamy dressing.
The risotto took 30 minutes to arrive, although risotto tends to have a prep time of 15-20 minutes. Either they were struggling or inefficient in the kitchen. As soon as the dish arrived, I knew it was a disaster. The butter had split from the mixture to form this pool, failing to stay contained within the emulsion. The rice was both overcooked and undercooked, not al dente at all. There were thick slices of Parmesan on top, which do not help with the flavor balance. The risotto was too pale and lacked the appropriate amount of saffron. The dish ended up tasting bland yet thick and greasy.
Service was great though. I let the servers know I wasn't happy and they took the risotto off my bill and offered to make me another dish. I refused, not wanting to waste any food, but I appreciate how gracious they were about the whole thing."
173,73,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/21/2020,"Absolutely amazing from start to finish!! The waitstaff is so attentive, love the authentic atmosphere, and the food...omg the food!!! The bread was unbelievable on its own, but dipped in the olive oil was even better!!! We had the Arincini  balls as an appetizer. I've never been a big fan of these and now I know why...they weren't made properly!! But Cantina made them so delicious!!! I won't eat them anywhere else ever again!! We had their specialty pasta with sausage and goat cheese. Absolutely awesome and so filling!!! You will NOT leave this place hungry!!

176,76,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,8/16/2018,"Dined here with 8 colleagues on a Wednesday night during a recent business trip in Boston.  Though noticeably busy, the hostess said she'd seat us ASAP.  After 15 awkward minutes of standing in the narrow entryway, our table was ready.  The dining room walls were plastered with Zagat awards from decades gone by.  I noticed there were none in recent years, then experienced why....

Our server was a nice bald Italian gentleman but was very inefficient.  After sitting unattended for 10 minutes, he came to the table, mentioned restaurant week specials then disappeared for 10 minutes before returning with that menu.  I had a hard time finding anything I was interested in eating, so I went with a salad. 

It took 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive and another 20 minutes for appetizers and bread.  The calamari was sub-par, very greasy and rubbery/tough.  Multiple order errors resulted from him not writing anything down:  2 people ordered the same beer but received 2 different colored brews, still he chose to deliver them.  A salad came out incorrectly and at the wrong time; I chose to just eat so I wouldn't have it reserved to me stale.

Long story short, our entire dining time was over 2.5 hours, not by choice.  Skip this place and try another Italian restaurant in the same 2 block vicinity."
177,77,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,6/27/2021,"Came here for dinner. It was good that we were able to make a last minute reservation. However, the meal did not meet our expectations. The bread wasn't very good.  I expect better from an Italian restaurant. The Arancini was good, but the temperature was inconsistent. The bolognese was good, but the pasta wasn't cooked enough. The gnocchi was possibly the worst I've had in my life. The sauce was good, but something was wrong with the pasta. The service started out good, but as they got busier throughout the evening we ended up waiting over 20 minutes for the check. I found the ladies room to be a little dirty for my liking."
178,78,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/22/2019,"This place is so good! While there were lines elsewhere, I was surprised that there wasn't one for this restaurant. Everything was great.

+Food: Be sure to get a dish that has the HOMEMADE pasta. 
-Arugula Salad: So fresh and a great way to wet your palate. Comes with lots of Parmesan cheese
-Bolognese: Ugh so good. I love these classic flavors. I got some cheese shredded on top. Very hearty. Couldn't finish and had a little bit left to bring home.
-Gnocchi: Honestly, some of the best gnocchi I've ever had. It was so soft and not stale tasting or overpowering in any way. I can't remember a time I've had better gnocchi than this.

It was Christmas Eve and packed house, so was willing to give them a bit of a break. We made a reservation for 8:30 pm and arrived at 8:15. We were there to celebrate my parents' 48th Anniversary. 

It was disappointing that despite our reservation made earlier in the day, we weren't seated until almost 9:20 pm.  

Luckily the kind waitress/bareback/all star put on the BYU/Hawaii football game! 

Also, two groups of 4 people who walked in after is and did not have reservations were actually seated before us! 

I think it was because of the end of the night, but the food just wasn't up to our usual eats at Cantina. I ordered veal Gino, but was served chicken Gino and told it was veal she. I inquired. I decided to take the high road and eat the chicken! 

We also ordered antipasto that never arrived. 

We will come back and I'll post a new review next time.  Hoping it was just an off-night. I did notice the manager Chuck was off duty and the owner didn't seem to be around either. 

I will say the 2 ladies behind the bar did an excellent job entertaining guests while waiting for their tables. 

It was bad the off night cane during our special family celebration, but my parents still had a good time."

It was a quick bite. We weren't too hungry and needed to save room for desert. I would have loved to have had a large long meal here. Maybe next time...."
184,84,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,5/14/2019,"I guess we should have known when we called and sought a last minute reservation on a Saturday night and this was the one place that said they had availability that it was unlikely we'd be seated anywhere near our reservation time, but a wait of an hour is really pretty obscene.  And, the host kept assuring us we were ""easy"" or ""close,"" rather than just being honest or answering us when we checked in repeatedly to ask how many parties were ahead of us or how long of a wait we could expect.  In fact, when we called to make the reservation we were specifically told, ""we're running on time and expect to continue doing so, so please be on time.""  

The waiting area is packed as could be and the bar where you could have a sip and wait is so slow and borderline rude.  It took about 20 minutes to get a beer poured, more for a cocktail, and while you wait, no acknowledgement that your order is next or there's a long backup.  

The food itself was fine, but unremarkable, especially when all the other places on Hanover are pretty much fantastic.  Honestly, nothing justifies the awful service.  It's clear that this place dupes diners by making reservations they can't really accommodate.  It's unconscionable and destroyed our evening.  

Cocktails here are overpriced.  A negroni was $13 and it was overly iced and nothing special.  

The antipasto appetizer special of the day which had several burrata, slices of proscuitto, and grilled artichoke, was the highlight of the meal.  No complaints there.  It was solid.  The meatball appetizer which came with three very large tender meatballs was quite tasty.  The arugula salad was boring but okay, topped with slices of parmesan cheese and a few tomatoes.  The bolognese was okay but the noodles were really stuck together and it could have used a little bit more olive oil and a touch more flavor.  Nothing special."
185,85,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,4/18/2021,Host is extremely rude. They claimed to have outdoor dining on both the website and opentable but when we got to the restaurant it was indoor only and the hostess was extremely rude on the phone and when we were seated.
186,86,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,1/25/2020,"This is the first Yelp review I've ever written, which says a lot about this restaurant. With so many Italian restaurants to choose from in the North End, I am so happy we stumbled upon Cantina Italiana.

We started with the Fried Calamari and antipasti -- both were perfect. For entrees, I had the pesto with homemade pasta and my boyfriend had the Fra Diavolo. To finish, we had the tiramisu which was one of the best desserts I've ever consumed. To top it off, our waitress was lovely and attentive.

I 100% recommend this place to anyone in the area!"
187,87,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/4/2021,Yummmy! Old school Italian that is spot on with food and service. We had barely sat down when the bread basket with nice thick crusty bread. We started with calamari and it was perfect. My husband had lunch he chicken parmigiana plus a side of pasta and I think we could have split it and still had leftovers. My spaghetti and meatballs was awesome. Not a lot of sauce but still delicious. We were tempted by dessert but we were so full we had to pass. I would recommend to anyone.
188,88,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/22/2021,"My wife and I went here with another couple last Thursday night, 19 Aug.  The food was outstanding. My wife ordered the grilled blackened salmon and she was raving about the flavor. Also, the skin was not cut off as my wife prefers the skin for the omega 3's. The other couple both ordered the veal saltimboca and both said it was excellent. I ordered the chicken piccata and it was delicious. We had fried calamari for an appetizer and it was prepared nicely with hot peppers and a marinara sauce and a lemon wedge. 
The ladies both ordered red sangria and they said it was one of the best with not too much ice. I had a vodka martini and my brother in law had the espresso martini. Both were prepared just right. A complimentary dessert of a cannoli, regular tiramisu and a lemon tiramisu ended our meal. This was unexpected and they were delicious.  Our waitress, Maria was very personable and helped us with our menu choices.  Truly a wonderful experience."

We enjoyed screaming out random words at the top of our lungs while the football fans cheered on their team. 

As for the food- delicious. We started with the nachos pulled pork- good- could have used some sour cream and salsa- but still good. 

For my main I had their chicken sandwich and fries- delicious! My niece and her bf also enjoyed their meal. 

Drinks are pricey here- but it's Boston so that's to be expected. 

Loved that they checked our vaccine status (I know that's required here- but as a visitor from North Carolina it was new to me- I wish it was required back home) 

Our waitress was friendly and attentive- would definitely return and recommend."

After being unable to get into a nearby bar that we had tickets for we were pleasantly surprised to find a indoor and outdoor seating along with decent size TVs to watch the game. Shortly after we arrived the place filled to standing room only. We had a booth and after initially having to walk and place our orders at the bar the bartenders were great and very attentive. Despite the place being packed they kept the drinks and food coming directly to our table. The food was your standard bar fare but again the service was great"

My husband got wings and i got a chicken sandwish with fries. The young adults loved the fries. My husband and i really enjoyed the sandwish and bun and dipping sause served on side. Sandwich and fries were served hot a big plus for me. I believe premium beers were $6-$8 for 16 oz. We had a new waitress who seemed very dedicated to getting everythg right. She was being trained by a petite blond who was also very pleasant and experienced. Of course the bar area was very loud but the few side booths and upstairs were much quiter. Bathroom was clean too!"
198,8,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,10/13/2019,"I feel like the restaurant is going through an identity crisis. The WiFi password is ""thebestbbq"", the yelp menu is all about BBQ, but the menu we got today was more sports bar-esque food. If they changed the menu, fine, but a little ""new menu!"" sign would have felt proper.

Service was fine. Our waitress was busy since we came in on a weekend, but she came around every so often. We had to flag her down a couple of times, but had no problem otherwise.

The food experience and price was what made the experience subpar. The kitchen needs to get better at figuring out logistics, because when our food came, my roommate's chicken was steaming hot while my beef was much closer to room temperature.

The fries (with beer cheese and bacon) were delicious and by far my favorite dish of the evening. Was it worth the $10 price tag for fries? Probably not, considering the portions were exactly the same as the side fries that came with my main dish. 

According to my roommate, the southern fried chicken tasted nothing like what you'd expect from ""southern"" fried chicken. It was just fried chicken, with none of the insane crispness that he was used to.

The hanger tips were good, but that's about it. The meat was tender, but somehow not juicy. I personally wouldn't get it again.

Lastly, the draft beer was $7, which is overpriced in my opinion.

All in all, a pretty forgettable place and experience."

Their website let us order (to pay at restaurant) and everything. We scheduled the time for 6PM today and headed over. Upon arriving, we see the restaurant has a sign saying that they're closed until 6/13. What professional establishment would not mention they're closed for a week (6/6-6/13) and not put it anywhere on their website or prevent people from placing online orders? It's a good thing I didn't pay while placing the order because it would have been a giant waste of $200.

Just based on this experience, don't come here and just reading some of the reviews on here, it's not even worth it anyways."

Attempted to order online and the online system did not work so I resorted to calling in my order. One meal in my order was for someone with a serious Gluten allergy. I made it very clear on the phone with specific directions that I needed a Chicken Caesar Salad with NO CROUTONS and GF Caesar dressing on the side. 

Embarrassing to go to this meeting to find that there is are croutons on this salad. This is the type of allergy where a containment like this is health threatening so to say I was disappointed was an understatement. Had to order an additional salad but made sure to get it from a different restaurant as I couldn't risk another mistake like this. 

All other food was good but overall experience was hindered because of this."
204,14,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,9/21/2019,"Meh. Short rib is no good. Burned as hell. Corn bread looks like pond scum surgically relocated to a baking pan and baked. Falls apart before it gets to the table. Salad was basically a vehicle for blue cheese, and overwhelming.

Service tip: When someone (sober) spills a drink, you replace it. Your restaurant is making so much money off of drinks. You can replace it. It was a mistake. Don't give the stink eye.

And you should offer to kill the audio to play a watch party's fight song. We were told ""the guy who does the audio isn't here."" It's not rocket science. Make a call. Figure it out.

Why are you in this business?"

As far as the food

The potatoes salad was ok 
The greens where hard and should have been cooked longer.

Tough brisket, ""pulled pork"" that was basically pork jerky, and every side was completely void of seasoning. I felt as if they tried making every dish we had for the first time. 
Order a beer if you want a fine enough atmosphere, but leave and go eat somewhere else."

212,22,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,12/15/2018,"If I could give this place a negative, I would! Worst food ever. Their ""smoked wings"" are a joke..smoke wings should fall off the bone and theirs....theirs...I can't explain. Not good! Cornbread...HA! Jiffy's taste better, cornbread should be warm and soft, totally opposite for them...cold and hard. Rice and beans...why did I ever order this because I kinda knew what I was setting my self up for. Let me just say...ONE (1) bite and it remained in the bowl/cup.  Absolutely NOOOOOOOOO flavor, not a pinch of salt...nada...zip...zilch! If I had to give something a positive one star it would be the brisket and that's before cutting all the fat off. 

My friend didn't eat his food either and he's not a picky person at all."

And what a beautiful night for this. I looked at the menu outside  and I was super surprised to find out that this was a BBQ joint & bar. The ambiance is dim lights and a few TV is around. In back is a  shuffleboard  and plenty of open Windows to see the people walking it's near the  TD Garden. We was greeted by a friendly Hostess that sat us  down at a table and she had our waitress come over right away. I ordered the brisket combo with mac and cheese and collars and hubby have the steak tip with rice and mac and cheese. I was hoping the mac was decent ,it was ok, bland but you still get that baked feel. The collards ,whoa ,super vinegar alert ! Not my cup of tea . Cornbread a little dry no butter around ,didn't wanna bother our now scarce waitress . The brisket was perfect. No issues there. Hubby had steak tips medium prolly shouldn't have because they were semi-dried out . Could have used gravy with it . Rice and beans were ok just plopped some beans on the yellow rice.  He didn't touch his Mac after I made ""the face"" he calls it . I was full off my brisket,big portions they give you. Music was on point so made my date night a good one here ! I recommend coming here you would enjoy it ! Just don't look for your waitress much after being seated ,lol . Getting the check is fun too !"
214,24,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,9/13/2018,"My boyfriend and I got the Tres Combo to share. We picked the brisket, ribs, and sausage along with chips and potato salad. We figured that, because this was a $30 plate of food, it would be enough for 2 people to share. We were very, very wrong.the cornbread was awful and crumbly (we didn't finish it). There was a small handful of chips which were good but it left only about 5 chips per person. One single sausage to split, 2 ribs, and thin slices of steak that were supposed to be brisket I think? None of it was good and it was VERY overpriced. 

We ordered a couple of IPAs off the drink menu but we were shocked that they were $10 each when we got our bill. We get it, Boston prices suck, especially for alcohol. But our total for one small place of mediocre food, 2 well whiskey and cokes, and 3 beers was $75 (without tip)."

219,29,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/17/2015,"Had the ribs. They were interesting. You could definitely taste the smoke but the texture of the ribs wasn't what you would expect from some slow smoked ribs. It may also be a result of the fact that the ribs were too big and the seasoning doesn't really get into the meat. 

My preference would be to have smaller ribs and to smoke them until they form a good ""bark"" on the outside and the meat will fall off the bone. 

Anyway, I'd go again for a drink. Just not fit the food."

It's a BBQ menu mostly, although you'd never get that impression by the blasé name, The Causeway Restaurant. Our server was nice, drinks were good, but the food was so-so. I had a chicken quesadilla and it was just okay---the tortilla wrap was very dry and cracker-crusty. I only ate half of it. Maybe I'll pop in again when I'm attending an event at the Garden....maybe I won't. Some of the other menu items sounded good, but then again, so did the quesadilla. We shall see."

Definitely check it out!"
225,35,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,11/5/2014,"No no no.  Nothing was good about this place.  I work a couple of blocks away and came here with some coworkers for lunch.  Let me list all of the reasons I will never return:

1. Food - this is the most important thing (obviously).  I ordered the spicy sausage with collard greens, fries and a piece of cornbread.  Why these sides?  Because this supposed BBQ place does not serve mashed potatoes or mac and cheese. WHAT?  

- Spicy sausage - the only edible thing on the plate.  I took it out of the too-hard roll.
- Collard greens - ew.  Barely warm and too mushy.  I had 1 bite.
- Fries - tasteless.  How do you mess up fries?  They had no salt.  My coworker next to me bathed her fries in ketchup.  I ate 3.
- Cornbread - hard and dry.  Why is the cornbread at Boston Market better than the cornbread here?  I took 2 bites.
- Drink - diet coke... with no bubbles.  The waitress said it was just their gun.  So why are you serving people sodas when you know it has no bubbles?  I had her take it back and had water.

2. Cleanliness - I opened up my napkin wrap to find a long brown hair.  Since I was with coworkers (and my boss), I didn't make a big deal out of it and just asked for another wrap (about 10 minutes later when the waitress appeared).

3. Service - besides the waitress serving uncarbonated sodas and taking a while to check on us, the thing that annoyed me the most is that she expected us to clear the table for her.  We were seated in a semi-circular booth and my boss was signing the check.  The waitress wordlessly held out her arm for us to give her our plates.  She didn't ask and she didn't wait the 3 minutes for us to leave so that she could clear the table.  I had 3 plates - food plate, bread plate that was already there and my cornbread plate.  She literally held out her hand for each one.  Why?  Just wait until we leave.  Or ask or something.  That was just so strange to me.  I don't want to clear the table for you.  Also, please note that this was a late lunch and there were literally 4 other customers (2 couples).  Its not like there were people waiting for our table and she had to rush.

Anyway - due to the terrible food and annoying service - I have no desire to ever step foot in this place again.  Too bad because it is close to my office.  I'll stick with Beer Works, Tavern in the Square or... pretty much anywhere else."
226,36,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,11/23/2019,"The woman at the door was very rude and sexually suggestive and made inappropriate gestures with her hands and eyes. She made everyone in our group, male and female, so uncomfortable that we left without refund or explanation. We will not be coming back."
227,37,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/21/2016,"Overcrowded inside, but no line to get in. $10 entrance fee. Great for a pre or post Bruins / Celtics game hangout. 2 floors which was pretty cool. First floor is more of the sit down at the bar scene, while the upstairs has room to dance and be more social. This place was packed when I went with some friends on a Saturday night. Very casual - jeans and a t-shirt will do. Mixed drinks and liquor were $7 a piece. 

What docks this place the 2 stars was how busy it was and the capacity. We waited about 10 minutes before we got the bartenders attention, and then after we got our drinks, no where to sit or move for that matter. Definitely regretted spending so much to get in and not getting our money's worth."
228,38,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,9/21/2014,"Wings honey buffalo black pepper - excellent. Smoked and fried. 

Rib tips - doused in honey mustard sauce - whole ribs, literally. Dey exterior but a juicy grey sample meat inside. 

Rib and pulled pork combo. Large spares - nice bark but needed to be finished for longer. Lacking moisture but not bad. Pulled pork was Lacking flavor and Unmemorable. 

Brisket sandwich - rubbery, tough , Unrendered fat. Not much smoke profile. Full slabs of fat all around.

Cucumber salad was fresh but interesting choice adding mustard.

Edamame succotash with crisp beans was excellent. 

Cole slaw was from Sysco, maybe?

A pleasant service but needs some maturity before I'd return."
229,39,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/20/2018,Been here twice and gotten two very different things. First the nachos which weren't that great and then today the platter of pork with coleslaw and mac and cheese and cornbread. The pork was ok. The coleslaw had no flavor and the Mac and cheese was that Mac and cheese you heat up as a child with some weird seasoning on it. Probably won't be going back for a third try- not worth it. Good music though.

231,41,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,8/23/2017,"Stopped on a Sunday because the sign said Boston's best barbecue, the title is obviously self-proclaimed.

In my experience good barbecue is juicy and tender, Causeway's barbecue is neither of these things and dry & chewy are more accurate depictions. We tried both the pulled chicken and the pulled pork (the former on a sandwich and latter on a salad) and it was pretty much universally bad. We asked for extra dressing just to make the meat more edible and give it some moisture. Barbecue sauce was nothing to write home about, the best comment we can give is on the fries which were edible! We received the bill after a very (VERY) long wait as well, so not too happy with service either (and this was at the bar).  Causeway was overall disappointing and a waste of time & money. We didn't even want the plethora of leftovers because it was that bad."

234,44,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,8/18/2014,"Oh jeez...what the heck happened...

I've been back twice since the soft opening and it's progressively gone downhill. The first time back, I'd dragged friends along to share my excitement. We ordered two rib platters and 3 brisket sandwiches. The ribs were so tough I ended up with a lot of it left on my plate. My friends' sandwiches remained largely untouched because most of it was bread. We ended up sticking around for drinks, but that also meant dealing with a waitress who was also too busy for us. EVerything took a really long time, and when asked about their alcohol selection, she had to run to the bar for every. single. question.

The second time I came back, I dragged the manfriend because I was afraid I was an unfair judge of bbq. We were told it was a 15 minute wait. Sure. Fine. Great. We waited.

15 minutes became 30 minutes before we were seated. Our food came out fast. I knew better than to get ribs this time so I got a pulled pork sandwich. Manfriend ordered a rib platter and left half of it untouched. It was just too tough and his rack of ribs just so happened to be the ones that were too well cooked...(smoked? bbq'ed? burned???). The sides all tasted like they were mixed in the same too-vinegary sauce. 

We live down the street, but last week when I craved bbq, I just ordered from some placed called L. L. Jay's bbq cafe via diningin. :/ Pity; I really wanted to like this place."
235,45,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,2/5/2017,"This was almost a 2 star rating!  The atmosphere bumped it up to 3.  I went on a Sunday and the music was loud, the place was crowded, and it was exactly what we wanted.  The food however, was awful!  The wings were big and tasted more like baked chicken.  They weren't like the smoked wings I'm used to but a friend of mine enjoyed the sauce.  The sides were worst.  The macaroni and cheese was not a crowd pleaser neither were the greens.  The red beans and rice were edible but lacked flavor.  Next time, I will probably stick with fries and a drink.  I would return for the vine only!  I will say that you may not be catered to by the host or hostess because no one helps you at the door.  You can however find a server that will help you."
236,46,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,11/6/2018,"Sad excuse for ""BBQ"". Came in and we ordered a brisket sandwich and a pulled pork quesadilla. Brisket sandwich was cold and flavorless, but our waitress didn't come by once to ask how anything was or to refill drinks. Quesadilla had hardly any cheese, didn't have any onions or cilantro like listed in the menu , and was as thin as two tortillas."
237,47,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,1/10/2019,Has a good atmosphere and good service especially for the location. Came in on a bruins game and got great service even though it was busy. Food was really good. Just not 5 star worthy in my eyes. You really gotta knock my socks off to get the ol' 5 star from me.
238,48,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,7/24/2016,"I have to be honest...  This is a great spot for a drink near The Garden / North Station, and the food is OK, but a bit of a disappointment after the glowing recommendation I received from a neighborhood local I met on the train coming home from Maine (shame on me for not checking out the Yelp reviews first).

I'd come back for a beer and an appetizer (it's the food that didn't impress), especially since we only share a couple of appetizers (and a few beers), but I'm skeptical (based on those apps.) . 

On the plus side, the service was great.  They ""checked our luggage"" at the for us, the bartender was great (wish I remembered his name), and the open-air windows were nice.  

If in the neighborhood I'd probably stop back for drinks, and maybe I owe them another shot on the food, but, as I said, I'm skeptical."
239,49,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,11/15/2014,"I'm split on this review because some of the food was good and some was straight awful. I would highly recommend the Mac and cheese, cornbread, beans, and potato salad. Their BBQ on the other hand was just no. The pulled pork was so dry I actually coughed, and the ribs were straight bones and barely any meat. The wings were somewhere in the middle. Not bad but not the best. Unfortunately, they really dropped the ball on the bbq food. 

Service was great though and everyone was really friendly!"
240,50,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,6/17/2018,"I made a account just to share how awful this place is. I went there for a night out with friends, and from the moment I entered bouncers and employees were being hostile. We reserved a table weeks in advance but they were ""getting ready"" for an hour..and never got us our bottle.  We had to fight our way upstairs to our reservation and the man at the bar almost took my real id. It's a shame this place is allowed to do business. Save your time and go straight to the Harp next door."
241,51,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,10/6/2018,Had the burger and is was tasty! Great place to grab a bite before a concert at TD Garden. Friendly staff and fast service
242,52,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,9/29/2018,Came here with my friends last Saturday night and had the best time! The staff was super friendly and we got free cover charge at the door. Will definitely be back before a game.
243,53,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,11/18/2019,"I make sure I go to Causeway anytime I'm in Boston! The food is excellent, the service is fast and the servers are polite and go out of their way to take care of their patrons. The bar is amazing with bartenders that actually know how to make drinks properly and they have a great selection of beers. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston Garden! Excellent atmosphere and music, hopefully I can get back to visit soon!"
244,54,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,11/17/2018,Probably the dumbest bar I've been to. You have an entire upstairs bar full of people for both teams for a football game you said you would show with volume. Multiple people ask to turn the strobe lights off in the upstairs section to watch the game and the response is to instead turn the game volume off and turn on the music full volume like a dance floor. Telling of a bar that not only ignores customers but does the exact opposite of what they ask.
245,55,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,1/9/2019,Pretty chill place  for Boston had grilled burritovetabke very good to eat relaxed and cool juice box playing very reccimand chill joint
246,56,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,11/10/2018,Great atmosphere and great fries. My alma mater hosts watch parties here and the bartenders are great; they're extremely friendly and attentive
247,57,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,11/7/2019,"I'be been frequenting Causeway since they have opened! Staff is amazing! New versatile menu (intelligently has evolved for the up and coming area)  is wonderful: pertains to people looking for bar food, people looking for a nice piece of steak/steak tips, or surprisingly vegetarian options! I love making Causeway my go to spot for events at the Garden. Fast food and accommodating service. Food, Drinks, Service won't disappoint, it will become your stable piece of the West End. Check it out!"
248,58,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,9/1/2018,"Atmosphere is nice, food is very mediocre.
Pro-tip: Chicken wings have been successfully & deliciously prepared without smoking them for over a half a century.  (I'm from Buffalo-you don't smoke wings!) With that, avoid their smoked wings-they are awful-and unfort the only option for wings here.  Other items we ordered-pulled pork BBQ sandwich, quesadilla, salad were fine-but nothing to write home about."
249,59,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,5/20/2018,"In a word: eh. Ribs and pulled pork were okay. Nothing to write home about for sure. Meat was a day or two old, as was the cornbread. The Mac and cheese was tasteless and the angry corn was much too flavorful. The spice overpowered the corn forcing me to wonder whether I had ordered the corn or just dry salsa. The broccoli and cheese was broccoli for sure but the cheese was so watered down, legally it probably shouldn't be called cheese anymore. Service was meh. She mostly had a smile on her face but was much more interested in chatting with the regulars at the bar.

TL;DR : I wasn't expecting much for BBQ in Boston and was still disappointed."
250,60,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/30/2016,"The place was pretty nice.. Good food (BBQ steak tips were excellent).  But paid $15 to watch UFC, only to find out (after, of course) they ""can't"" put the TV in front of me on with the fight.  Then the closest TV to me someone stood in front of and they wouldn't ask him to move. 

Good food but, not sure if I'll be back based on that."

Highly recommend."
253,63,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,9/28/2019,"Went here to watch the first Pats game of the season this year. Service was fine, but the food on their ""new"" menu is TERRIBLE. I ordered nachos, and they were disgusting. Soggy and breadlike. Not even sure HOW you can mess up nachos so horribly. I immediately called over the bartender and asked to take them away because they were so awful; she didn't even offer to bring out another plate of them, so they clearly knew they were terrible and couldn't make them better. She later brought out wings as an ""apology"" from the cooks, but as a vegetarian this did nothing for me, but my friends enjoyed them. Would go back for drinks, but would NEVER order food from them ever again. When someone else later ordered nachos the bartender literally asked ""are you sure? She ordered them earlier and said they were terrible"", so they definitely know how bad the food is..."
254,64,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,11/17/2018,"Absolutely worst bar I've ever been to!!!

Do not waste money at this horrible establishment. Go to fenway or Faneuil hall instead."
255,65,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,1/12/2019,"I hate this place so much. Everyone is so mean and they make you wait in line for this ""secret upstairs"". All I know is that Boston should close this place because all the vouchers are so mean to everyone. A drink got poured on me and my friend luke. Everyone boycott this place. It is evil. It doesn't let me to 0 stars but that's what I'm giving it. Actually -1000000"
256,66,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,2/6/2018,"On Superbowl Sunday, we decided we wanted ribs.  We looked around the neighborhood and found this just a block away after Googling ""Best Ribs"".  We ordered on-line for pickup at 5:15, just before the game.  We then got a call at 4:00pm asking why we hadn't picked our food yet, and reminded them it was a 5:15 pickup.  We were a little worried they might just keep our food under a heat lamp until then, but said, nahhh, no one would do that! Wrong!  Once we got the food home , we realized that not only did they they do this, and charged us $54.00 for a rack and 1/2 of ribs, we found the food completely inedible.  Heed this review:  DO NOT ORDER TAKEOUT FROM THIS PLACE.  We sent an email with what happened, and guess what?  No response, so they clearly don't have any concern for their customers.  Google, you steered us completely wrong on this one, the ribs were the worst!"
257,67,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,8/21/2019,"Among the worst meals I have ever had. Potato salad tasted as if it had turned, ""fiery corn"" also tasted ""off."" Pulled pork was just pulled pork with some sauce poured over it. Table did not seem clean. Yuck. Love BBQ, and was looking for a new place to try. Happened to be in the neighborhood so thought I would try it. Never again! The waitress said they were changing their menu at the end of the week and would no longer be doing barbecue. But with that kind of indifference I'm not sure changing the menu will help."
258,68,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,12/26/2016,"Went here for quick eats before a Celtic's game since all others were packed. I was not disappointed, it was less crowded here and the service was prompt.

Their fries are yummy and quesadillas also!

Would definitely recommend this place if you want to get away from the other super crowded spots on Canal St."
259,69,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,8/7/2018,"This place was recommended by two people, but it was truly disappointing. The guy who served us was great, but the food was horrible. I ordered the brisket platter. I don't know what it was but it wasn't brisket. It was more like really thin steak that was cooked so well done it felt like I was eating a belt. It was covered with an ok BBQ sauce, which is how I was able to eat it. My beans and rice side had zero flavor unless cardboard is a flavor. My wife said her steak tips we're ok, but wouldn't want to eat there again. There were a few positives, the waiter was great, the angry corn was decent, and they served ice cold pineapple juice. That being said I wouldn't go her again. The only reason I gave it two stars was the waiter."

261,71,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,5/5/2015,"I love this place! I recently went before a bruins game and not only was the location ideal but the food was excellent. Real bbq is hard to find and Causeway really delivers. I especially loved all the different hot sauce options :)
I was also impressed by the service. Even though they were busy due to the bruins game they were attentive, friendly and quick. I'll definitely be back!"
262,72,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,12/23/2018,"food was absolutely terrible after i had waited forever. do not come here. disregard the comments about the racism rampant in this place and dont come due to the quality of food alone. 

i understand bars aren't going to have five star chefs in the kitchen but at least try!"
263,73,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,1/14/2018,"Fun bar, typical Boston prices, and located in the TD Garden area (a very active nightlife area). There are plenty of TVs if you are interested in watching any sports games while having a drink. Service is nothing to rave about, but is never lacking. Drinks come without any frills, the bartenders just want to serve you and move on to the next customer with speed in mind. Late at night, the upstairs is turned into more of club scene."
264,74,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,8/13/2017,"Echoing several other reviews, the service here is excellent and the food is a disaster. Very friendly, comfortable vibe! But man. The BBQ was stunningly bad."
265,75,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/5/2017,For a pub the food is ok. I ordered the brisket. It was cooked well and pretty tender but had lots of fat and gobs of bbq sauce. Fries were ok. Best thing for me was Mac & cheese.
266,76,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,7/5/2015,"Being a southern boy, I am always on the lookout for some tasty barbecue. The menu here does not disappoint. Any place that has greens, cornbread and a real smoker? Please! If you're hungry, order the platters. It's a lot of food!

The service can be hit or miss, depending on if you are upstairs or not. Ask to be seated downstairs. Service seems to be better there."
267,77,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,1/31/2018,"As a former waitress it takes a lot for me to be impressed.  Food is good here, and pretty fast...but the service from our server was amazing.  I hope Jennipher is rewarded for her excellent service. This is the hardest working person at this bar.  And nice too!  Thank you Jennipher!  You were awesome.

268,78,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,12/14/2014,"I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars for this place.  It's more like 2.5 stars.  I believe this is a newer place, right across the street from the Garden.  I came here after an early afternoon celtics game with my dad.  

Red flag #1 was the fact that this place was empty and people were bypassing it for a more crowded Harp.  That was a harbinger of things to come.  

First impressions was this place was a BBQ joint, though the menu had some odd items on it.  I went with the Cubano, which was average at best.  The problem was the sides.  Cranberry mashed potatoes?  Really strange tasting.  The baked beans were a disgrace to any BBQ place.  Watery and definitely undercooked.  My dad seemed to enjoy his chicken salad sandwich and clam chowder (with cornbread and olive oil.  Wtf?).  I'm not sure what the chef is really thinking with some of these combinations.

To make it worse, our server was slow despite having literally no one else to serve.  She even forgot what my dad ordered.  Twice.  

I probably will avoid this place in the future for food after a game."
269,79,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,9/16/2015,"Food was Superb  make sure you take advantage of the newly added ""Fried Mac n Cheese balls"" for an appetizer and the ""Chicken Quesadilla"" which was fresh well seasoned and crispy. Great job Chef Jeshua 

The service was 100% on point! The bartender poured and had ready a glass of water with a lemon on side and placed in front of me within a minute of sitting at the bar and proceeded to be very attentive and hospitable. Make sure to ask for Dave and say ""HI"" he is the man!

The overall atmosphere was great from the friendly staff, music and decoration/setup definitely a place you need to experience! 

Thank you Tim for a great time!"
270,80,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,11/4/2017,I would give no star if I could. Waited half an hour in line to get into Causeway and waited another hour to get upstairs to the club? Saw groups of people skip the line and get into the elevator to go up to the same club. Won't be back.
271,81,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,2/2/2015,"This review is long overdue.. I went to the Causeway when I was home just before Christmas.  The service was excellent, as were the wings.  It is extremely hard to find a restaurant in Boston that actually knows how to make Barbecue, and this place has NAILED IT!!

I went there with a fairly big party and we got plenty of items off of the menu.  Wings were unreal, wing tips were also a great appetizer.

I then got the brisket which was extremely tender and cooked just as if I was eating it down in the south at a BBQ joint.

I ended up staying there pretty late into the night and the place filled up with a great crowd of people.  Bartenders were very cool and mixed up some great drinks.  

Overall, I will def be back to this place the next time I am in Boston."
272,82,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,10/1/2017,"We checked out this bar/club after a concert at TD Garden. The wait was not too bad (~10 minutes) to get inside and a $10 cover. We had quick service at the bar and then proceeded to wait in another line for the upstairs ""club"" scene. Once inside, the music was really good- great mix of popular hits and throwbacks. The only down side was the lack of mats to prevent the floors and stairs from being so slippery from spilt drinks."
273,83,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,7/17/2017,"I was very disappointed with the Causeway. I went with a group of friends on Friday night because the line was short to get in, and paid $10 for cover. We got inside and got drinks only to realize that the real line to get into the dance area was inside, after you already paid cover. Sleazy move. Waited 50 MINUTES in line inside and still were not in the dance area. We asked for a refund on our cover charge since we just waited in line for an hour and were thenkicked out of the bar aggressively and swore at by the manager. Will never return and will tell everyone I know that this place is definitely not worth it especially given the other great options in the area."
274,84,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,3/14/2019,"Such a terrific spot in the heart of the sports world in downtown Boston! The service and friendly staff were only a part of our enjoyable evening. The food and bar service were excellent - they have a bacon cheeseburger w bbq sauce that is heaven!! Their apps are so yummy esp the truly exotic cheese plate, the shrimp, and the pub chips. Sam the bartender (shouldn't every bar in Boston have a Sam?) is great, with super suggestions for spirits suggestions. The chef came and visited with us which really topped off our night. Looking forward to our next visit FOR SURE!"
275,85,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,5/16/2018,"My husband and I stopped here to grab a quick meal before the celtics game. It seemed pretty busy when we walked in, but we were seated upstairs shortly. It was loud but what do you expect from a crowded restaurant. Our food came quickly and correct. Everything was so good and exactly what I wanted. We left feeling full and happy."
276,86,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,9/13/2015,"If you're going for drinks, especially beer, you're at the right place. They have a great list of beers on draft and have security which is a plus. The staff is really friendly and they serve you pretty fast. 

The kitchen closes at 10 on Sundays, which was a bummer. My friend had to order for me while I was on my way. 

It's not in the prettiest area but it works overall. Try not to walk over there at night if you're more than 10 minutes away. Not very safe. (Man or woman) 

This place is a nice and organized bar. I wouldn't consider it a restaurant per se although I must say that the food is great and affordable. Had a burrito on a plate and my friend had a pulled pork sandwich with beans and cole slaw. His portion was abundant."
277,87,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,1/19/2015,"Great barbecue! They have a legit smoker and you can tell. We have never had a bad meal here and they have a variety if beer. Its a hidden gem before any game at the garden. 

The quesadilla's are my favorite and the corn bread is spot on. The food is served quickly but with enough time to enjoy yourself. Baked beans were spot on, and the Cesar salad was vert different. They even give you complimentary home made bbq sauces in glass bottles. Nice touch. I highly suggest this new spot!"

Pretty good food, definitely tried to skimp on the syrup though but when we asked there was more. I had a drink called Bonita applebaum. OMG so good. Rumchata, some kind of apple liquor and caramel.

281,1,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,3/25/2022,"Of the clutch of coffee shops and cafes in Charlestown MA, incredibly, just this one - Zume's - no longer allows customers to use their bathroom, even in an emergency and after paying for items.  

So if you order at Zume's and gotta go, no luck ""because it's Covid""!? This is the end of March 2022 when Zume's management no longer requires masks. But they keep the bathroom locked behind a hanging curtain?! 

So best advice is go forth to Tatte, Starbuck's, Sorelle's, Style, and other local coffee shops that respect customers enough to maintain an accessible, clean restroom post-Covid."

283,3,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,2/19/2020,"So I have been living in Charlestown since September, but today was my first time to Zume's. I normally make my coffee at home but I'm out of almond milk and thought I'd stop here on my way to work. 

I brought in my Yeti cup figuring that maybe they offer a lower price for bringing your own cup (come one people, let's save Earth one cup at a time). Nope I was in fact charged for a large when I'm sure my 20 oz Yeti is most likely smaller than their large. No almond milk on the counter and I was in a rush so I didn't want to wait back in line to ask for some. Oh well. ""Large"" drip coffee medium roast and yogurt parfait for a whopping $7.38

This is not what bothered me about this visit. I get to work, have a couple morning meetings and finally sit down at my desk to enjoy my parfait. I open it up to find black hairs in the parfait. I would normally be ok and just say let's pull that hair out and carry on, but the more I dig around the more hairs I found. Absolutely foul. This is unforgivable in my mind. I would hope the employees making these parfaits would be wearing a hair net, but clearly not. 

I would love for a manager to reach out to me to resolve this matter. This is appalling for any food industry service. Yuck."

real COFFEE.
COFFEE with testicular fortitude even.
Tasted like coffee, not a warm brown undistinguished beverage.
Take a BOW, Zume's.

We dropped in just before closing time after a big walk / climb and exploring Bunker Hill Monument and museum in Charleston Ma.

Service issues alleged by other reviewers were a non event in our experience. Greeted warmly. Served promptly. WiFi worked, no passwords = no problemo.

Savoury quiche was passable nothing special.
Passing grade (barely) in the cleanliness department,
Soundtrack not in my sweet spot, a tad whiny, but hey......

A comfortable oasis on a day when our 1st choice in Charleston for lunch stopped serving at 3 pm and we didn't fancy 'bar snacks'.... and we kept walking.... 

was ZUME'S.

Mom n pop shop NOT a mean big green logo originating in Seattle = a plus.

Solid 4 star coffee house.

I'm all for supporting local. I walked by this place alot and it was always closed. I finally was around when open so i gave it a try. Man did I soon regret that.  looked at the menu for a bit, then once decided was still ignored,for a few mins. They finally notice me and I order. Got a hot salted caramel latte, even tho I ordered oded. Didn't say anything because i figured maybe I didbt say iced eveb tho I'm almost positive i did. Then I get the cup, its barely halfway full, AND its like salt water. So NASTY. Honestly, ill just stick to the Starbucks 2 more minutes down the road."

297,17,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,10/23/2019,"Went here for the first time this morning - I might be a regular customer from now on! Very friendly service, a great tasting americano (not acidic at all) and a very fluffy glazed donut. All in all a great experience."
298,18,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,1/15/2019,"I have been coming to Zumes for years as I love to support local businesses, but after a few recent visits that were below average I will now be finding a new coffee shop. Their iced coffee is one of my favorites, but that does not outweigh the poor (and often rude) service that I have received during my recent visits. There are not many things that can turn me off of a place I once loved, but rude service is just not appreciated, nor is it appropriate."
299,19,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,10/23/2017,"I sat here for about an hour or so to do some work, and I also ordered an iced chai tea latte, which was good, but this review is mostly about the service! I forgot my wallet, and didn't realize until about an hour later, after Zume's had closed! However, one of the baristas answered immediately, and when I mentioned the wallet, she said she'd put it in their safe after checking to see if there was any contact info inside. They were still closing, so she said I could come by and get it if I could be there in the next few minutes. Overall, she went above and beyond to help me, and I'm super grateful!"
300,20,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,5/1/2018,"Zumes has been a Charlestown staple for some time now.  The coffee and food appeals to a wide selection of tastes.

I love the display of local art (which is updated regularly).

The service at Zumes is friendly, well organized and efficient.

There is always a hustle and bustle adding to the friendly vibe.

I personally prefer supporting local business owners."
301,21,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,5/23/2018,"When Zume's first reopened, I was not impressed. But 5 years later (and 1 ""no strollers inside"" policy) my opinion of this place has really changed. I've seen a conscious effort from management over the last few years to be more welcoming and hire more friendly staff. They've also rolled out several new food options including a larger variety of pastries and quick to-go lunch options like burritos and sandwiches. 

I think this place has finally become what Charlestown needed - a great little neighborhood coffee shop for the locals. Here's hoping that people continue to come here and support Zume's in spite of the new Starbucks down the block."
302,22,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,9/13/2015,"Love that this shop is so near my home, though that has no bearing on my review.

The interior is a cozy mix of industrial coffee house - sort of an ideal presentation in 2015. That interior alone is nothing to write home about, though the original wall art is always a welcome display. (I just wish I could afford some of it!)

The stars of this place is the food and coffee - just what you'd hope for at a ""coffee"" shop.

I got an Americano and added a touch of cream and sugar. (I prefer it con panna, but I realize not all coffee shops have whipped cream. No worries, it was still a great tasting espresso.)

Baked goods are always hit or miss to me. Sometimes they taste old, and you're sad you even gave them a shot. Not these! The quiche are made, then frozen, then thawed for display - still relatively fresh. My bacon and swiss quiche could have easily been fresh. After heating, the crust was a bit dry and softened under the reheating, but the lovely inside bits made it all come together nicely. It's so easy to ruin a quiche when runny eggs or too much of any one ingredient. These tiny pockets were harmoniously made.

Then I got the key lime tart. My hopes of saving it for later were a failure. That flamed marshmallow topper and golden graham crust were too luscious to ignore after my quiche. My remaining espresso needed a partner with whom to go down gracefully. Wow! Crusts on deserts are my favorite part. Faintly buttery, crispy but soft, and just a little sweet. The filling was everything you'd hope for from a quality pasty - not the lime green stuff you find in a sad, pre-packaged box. The marshmallow topping hid that glorious secret (normal colored filling!) all-too-well. Sorry, tart, I just couldn't save it for later. 

Which is ok, since I hope to be a regular at this place.

And, lest I forget, the staff were friendly and helpful. Nice crew."
303,23,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,2/28/2019,"Great little coffee shop with friendly service and good snacks. Coffee is full of great flavor, molasses cookies are incredible and the service is friendly. They have good little seating areas with local art on the wall. Nice place to spend some time."
304,24,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,1/13/2019,Coffee is okay. Sometimes it tastes burnt. Ordered a breakfast sandwiches that was really tough to eat. The bagel was definitely not fresh.
305,25,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/27/2019,"Been living in Charlestown for 30+ years and this place is legit. If you have kids, it's perfect. The nitro coffee is amazing and all the food is delicious. All the ""poor service"" reviews are BS. Support local business!  Can't miss."
306,26,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,4/25/2019,"You'd be hard-pressed to find a better breakfast sandwich with an english muffin. I got the sausage egg and cheese and it was a total knockout. It's essentially a Portuguese EM, fluffy and moist. Incredible."
307,27,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,4/23/2018,"The 5 stars is for their version of an English Muffin . More often than not I have to use a condiment on breakfast sandwiches due to the bread being so dry . I have now gotten the sausage breakfast sandwich three days in a row and each day it has been consistent . I'm a simple coffee girl . I just like black iced and they provide that at a decent price and not tasting burnt . I just moved in around the corner so I will pick this over Starbucks , only minus is it's very limited seating and it's usually full"
308,28,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,8/29/2018,"I really want to like this place but I can't. 

On multiple occasions I have been treated rudely by staff. The least of which has been eye rolls when ordering as I am not completely familiar with the menu. The worst is when I asked for a ""regular"" coffee as many small coffee shops have a regular and large size and getting rudely asked ""well, what is a regular?"" The staff here could save a lot of time and energy if they weren't so rude. 

Another problem I have is their hours. If they were open later I'm sure they would have more customers. I would rather support a local business like Zume's but if they make it difficult for me I can just use my drip coffee machine at home."
309,29,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,11/8/2018,"My girlfriend and I were staying in Charlestown and this cool little place was right down the street.  The staff is great! We had some cool conversation waiting for my coffees.  The Incredible Hulk singing ""Thriller"" on Halloween made my day!"
310,30,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,6/25/2018,"I really can't wait until cafe Nero comes to Charlestown and runs this place out of town! I have been there 3 times since it is right down the street from where I live and the 3rd trip will be my last.  So, the first time I went to Zume's I wanted a cold brew which they did not have, even though every coffee shop in the city including Dunkin Donuts now has cold brew. The second time I slept in on a weekend day and was craving a breakfast sandwich- well this is the only coffee shop I've ever heard of that does not serve breakfast past a certain time( like after 10:30 or 11am). I decided to go back because i was excited to hear that They finally served cold brew. So I went in and ordered a medium- $6.26.  I honestly thought she was kidding. Needless to say, I will not be back . It's too bad because it is a great space in a great location!"
311,31,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,12/19/2019,I wanted to try this place for a while and it didnt disappoint! The coffee was delicious and fresh. I got a breakfast sandwich and it was great. I highly recommend Zume's!
312,32,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/8/2018,"Just Okay

We wanted a cup of coffee and a few minutes to relax, so we popped in here.  While there was certainly wrong with anything (except the wi-fi), there was also certainly nothing memorable the place.  The service was adequate, the coffee was decent, the seating was comfortable, and the wi-fi didn't work."
313,33,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/10/2018,Stop by today for lunch. Clean quiet atmosphere in this coffee house. Staff was very helpful and ready to take my order. I purchased a lemonade and black iced tea. It was awesome! The cranberry and chicken salad was also awesome except for the small bone that pierced my tongue.
314,34,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,8/8/2016,"Good coffee and the pastries are amazing really tasty and fresh not super sweet I think they have the right amount of everything, the staff is always nice and patient if you are trying to decide what to order, the vibe in the place is chill and it welcomes you to stay and relax I recommend it if you are around !"

Had to argue to get a simple drink the way I like it 
Not even a simple thank you

Coffee marginal at best 
Atmosphere okay and comfortable"

317,37,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/23/2016,"Zume's is the best.  Coffee is consistent and good.  Customer service is great.  I highly recommend their baked goods and menu items.  I enjoy the egg and cheese bagel- without cheese, add ham and extra egg.  It's under $5, what a deal.

The chocolate chip cookie is like crack.  Sometimes I wish I had never tried a chocolate chip cookie from Zume's.  But I did, and now when I want to treat myself I get them.  They are huge, about 3-4 times the size of a normal cookie.  I like to enjoy 2 at a time.  Soft chewy center, large chunks of chocolate, and they are huge."
318,38,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,4/25/2014,"This is just what Charlestown was lacking; a laid back place to sip your latte and read or chat with some friends. Aside from the delicious coffee, this place is aesthetically pleasing with it's modern industrial feel. The artwork adds character and shows the connection to the community.

As an animal lover, it is great to see everyone gather with their pups outside, as Zume's shows their 4 legged friend support! All and all,  I am a lover of independent coffee shops and this place does meet everything I like in them. 

The only thing I wish is that they were open later at night. But being in Charlestown, the foot traffic may not be worth the extended hours! 

Keep it up guys!"
319,39,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,6/9/2015,"This is a cool little neighborhood place, where the look, right down to the pastry cases, definitely is equipped like McBucks, but that is where the comparison stops. They have fantastic baked goods, and a sizeable hot breakfast and sandwich array that comes out of a kitchen, not a Star-Trek-Meets-Suzy Homemaker convection warmer.  The coffee?  Very very good.  The only reason I drop it a star is because they have a ton of people working there, but when the coffee bar is slammed, and it's slammed, management only has one barista on? The place is packed as it's one of the few good breakfasteries around, so tell Scrooge McDuck to come up with a touch more cash for another pair of hands on the bar, please."
320,40,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,9/15/2017,"Had a very negative experience at Zume's. Went in for a coffee and food with friends midday after stroller bootcamp at the monument. We had two strollers between the four of us for our 3 month old babies. 

After ordering we were told that the stroller situation has been a bit of a problem there. They have implemented a no stroller policy recently and next time we cannot bring our strollers in.  We drank our coffee and before we were heading out another employee told us that we had to go outside and we cannot stay with our strollers and there is even a sign on the door. I informed both of the women that this was discrimination and we will not be returning.

How is this right? There was plenty of room for other customers to get by. Who will they discriminate against next? 

We live in the city... would they be paying for a replacement stroller if it were to be stolen out front? How can they expect a mother with young children to get her kids and belongings out of the stroller and come in and order...that is not feasible. 

I am all for supporting small local businesses but not when they mistreat their customers. Good luck with Starbucks coming in right down the street. I am sure they would be happy to have the business of mothers with children."
321,41,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,1/30/2019,"They intentionally have no outlets, which as someone who works remotely defeats the purpose of a coffee shop. I totally understand not wanting people to take advantage, but having no outlets seems excessive and petty. Food is fine"
322,42,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,6/17/2019,Love the interior and the cozy cafe feel. I typically order a medium iced coffee and it is very good. The sandwiches are made to order and made with fresh ingredients. It's one of my favorite places in the Charlestown area.
323,43,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,4/26/2015,"Turkey wrap is awesome. Convenience of getting said turkey warp is not. My first visit, I attempted to order at 11:56 and was informed the kitchen doesn't open till 12. So I stood aside for 4 minutes so that I could get back in line to order. Second time I got there a few minutes before 3. Waited in line. When it was my turn to order, they said the kitchen closed at 3.

I would eat here again, but I will never go out of my way to do so. If I was starving between 1215 and 245 and happen to find self directly in front of zumes and it was too inconvenient to go somewhere else maybe I'd give them another shot. 

I have also tried the iced coffee. It's not really anything special."
324,44,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,12/16/2015,"I love this spot whenever I'm in the area and looking for a quick bite I like to stop by and grab the avocado turkey sandwich it's so delicious. I haven't tried their coffee but their chai lattes are really good as well if you are looking for an alternative. The staff is super friendly and loves answering questions you might have. 

This spot is quiet for reading and has comfortable lounge chairs, the only drawback is that they don't have outlets so if you are looking to get some work done on your laptop it's a great spot until your battery runs out of charge."
325,45,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,9/8/2018,"Love the products great coffee and breakfast sandwiches but super disappointed in the service. I asked for a shot of espresso over ice in a large cup. I'm pregnant so I nurse my coffee/caffeine all day and need to have sufficient water/ice with it to stay hydrated. They pulled a small cup so I said no bigger -- they gave me a medium and then tried to charge almost $5 for a latte!  I said the price/product was wrong when it rang up and long story short they charge by the cup size regardless of what's in it. They were completely inflexible with the policy, despite my pregnancy and urging, they would not budge nor would they explain the rationale behind the policy. I hate to write a bad review - blame it on the hormones - but this was very disappointing to me."
326,46,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,8/19/2018,"Unfortunately, I think this place is very over-priced. A large cold brew is 8.51 -- they told me it's priced so high because it's George Howell brand...however I went past the George Howell booth at Boston Public Market and a large cold brew is only 5.00."
327,47,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,8/23/2018,"I am a pregnant woman who has lived in the Boston area for years. I went into this coffee shop to support a local business, rather than going to Starbucks down the street. I ordered an ice coffee and sat at the counter and ate a chia seed pudding that I had purchased at a local juicery. Despite having bought a coffee, the owner kicked me out for having brought ""outside food."" Horrible experience, I will never be back and will not recommend anyone else to come here in the future."
328,48,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,1/11/2018,"I've been to Zume's many times and each time I go in I am always blown away. All the staff is polite. They have great non-lactose milk options for coffee. But, the best part has to be their breakfast sandwiches; specially their 'english muffin"". It's soft, dense and buttery, almost like a biscuit. My go-to sandwich is the sausage, egg and cheese on the english muffin. It won't disappoint!"
329,49,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/28/2017,I love Zume's!!!  I have been going there since they opened. The coffee is more expensive than Dunkin Donuts however the quality of the beverages and food as well as atmosphere make it something I like doing for me and my

331,51,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,12/15/2016,Tried this place today instead of my regular Dunkin' Donuts and was pleasantly surprised. Really good coffee and quick service.
332,52,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,1/3/2015,"Great hot chocolate! I come all the way from Roxbury just for it. This is one of those rare coffee houses where the employees know your name and your order as soon as you step up to the counter. Fyi, don't go during the day on weekdays looking for a seat, all the moms with their babies crowd the place. I almost got taken out by a stroller once. Get your drinks and go, unless its in the evening by then all housewives are home making dinner lol"
333,53,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/15/2015,"Things I love at Zumes: the cookies (the best in Boston!!), the breakfast sandwich on English muffin, the baked goods (great muffins), and of course the coffee.  

But I wish they had more sandwich options.  They used to have heated ones but stopped.  Those should come back (especially in the winter months).  And I wish you could get smaller sized smoothies (the one size is just too big)."
334,54,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,9/30/2016,Coffee was solid and the baked good options looked decent but not overly tempting. Good for a quick drop-in.
335,55,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,10/23/2018,"Love that it's a 10 minute walk from my office. Coffee and chai tea latte has always been consistent.

336,56,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,11/22/2017,"Espresso drinks are weak, service poor. After various purchases and complementing the owner/manger on the decor, I was treated rudely by her for a humble request (certainly no customer first attitude shown)."
337,57,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,10/30/2013,Wish they started serving lunch earlier for the working people. It can't be that hard. When the place is busy it is hard to hear them call your name. Food was good.
338,58,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,2/4/2018,"First of all, I support small businesses and want to see them thrive but Zume's customer service has been so variable - sometimes they are ok but more often then not (lately) they have been unwelcoming/rude- it def needs improvement ( esp now that Starbucks is open). As far as food items go, Some items are great (English muffin sandwiches, ice coffee) but some things are incredibly overpriced (iced cold brew). If you want to keep customers, improve your customer service!"
339,59,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,12/13/2017,"Great, warm coffee shop! Downfall is they don't don't have Apple Pay, outlets for a phone or computer charge and don't take Amex. I spend at the very minimum $50 a week for coffee and lunch while I try to do some casual computer work before or after work. Unfortunately they lose out on me as a customer and many more who are looking for the same. I wish they would add these amenities to stay in the game now that Starbucks is here..."
340,60,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,3/11/2017,"Solid and consistent coffee and food at every visit. I wish they had more seating, granted I go at peak times. My favorite are the Latte's, always on point and keep me going for the entire day."
341,61,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,8/27/2018,"I came here for a quick grab and go breakfast and gotta say they've got ONE OF THE BEST ICE COFFEE around!  I'm picky with iced coffee since I like it black and no sugar/added flavors, but this ice coffee has some good fragrances and taste making it so refreshing to have!  I would come here again just for the ice coffee.  And also the blueberry coffee cake :)"
342,62,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,4/12/2014,"I've been here a few times and have enjoyed their (excellent) desserts, (excellent) drinks - tea and coffee all seem creative enough and tasty, and (excellent) sandwiches.
This place is typical for a good local coffee house, nothing crazy. But it's cozy, I've always enjoyed my experiences, the staff, and the food has always made me happy."

Hoping to have a more pleasant experience in the future"
349,69,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,2/11/2016,"No wall outlets. But friendly staff. Decent coffee, decent food. The inside is pretty cozy, and every time I've been, there's plenty of seating. It's a very typical coffee shop feel to it. It's a hard choice between 3 and 4 stars for me, but it's not much out of the ordinary. I wouldn't tell someone not to go, especially if you're looking for a nice little spot in Charlestown."

They only serve breakfast until 12 on weekends so you late risers should get there before noon. The egg sandwich is simple and delicious. 

Definitely try them out if you're in the area!"
351,71,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/15/2013,"This is a sold three star joint!  

I live within walking distance of Zume's and I have found that I prefer their lunch options over Sorelle.  While Sorelle may boast a larger sandwich menu, I find that the choices I've made in the sandwich category have been quite good.  Three standouts for me have been the Cuban, the Turkey and Avocado, and Chicken and Goat Cheese.  For breakfast, I am partial to the egg sandwich & the salmon & lox on a bagel.  Breakfast options can be a bit steep in price, though I find that I am full for a long period of time.  

I don't tend to like strong coffee, so when I do get coffee it does tend to be iced coffee in the summer.  In addition, I am partial to the Crimson Berry Iced Tea.  That is a fave of mine.  

Generally I get my stuff and leave.  As others have stated, many people do tend to camp out (perhaps due to the free wi-fi) and there is limited seating.  Since the remodel was done, I feel like there is even less seating.  While on the subject of the remodel, I feel like it became more industrial and austere in terms of the atmosphere.  The remodel did strip the place of some of its character, in addition it feels like the public space is smaller.  While I am sure that the work environment may be better for staff, for me that was a recognizable difference.  Though, all this doesn't bug me too much as I am a ""to-go"" girl.  

I do give the place props for showcasing local artists.  There's always new artists exhibiting their art, and you can't help but to check out the walls each time you come in."

(refer back to preface)  Idk if thats good or bad but its now my coffee of choice.  Finally, I enjoy all their food.  Obviously its a coffee shop and should be graded more heavely on the coffee but again, i dont have a coffee palett so for me to critique on that aspect would be remiss, but I couldnt see it not being delicious as the the americanos seem to fly out the door."

Worth a try!"

I'm only giving 3 strars through as there are often a lot of ""campers"" who sit all morning. With minimal seating, this can be frustrating for people who do want to eat. I will say that I'm not sure there's much they can do about this though as I would assume asking people to leave is the worse of two evils.

The Roasted Vegetable Sandwich was pretty slimey too. Go with the Caprese!

Lastly, I think the renovations look great."

358,78,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,11/17/2014,"I've finally decided to bite the bullet and write a review. I've ventured to Zumes about 4 times over the last two months. Each time I have had the older lady or the older man which I expect are the owners of the establishment.  I have been less than pleased with their service.  They seem to be quick to judge and always huff and puff while they are working.  My latte was warm and was only filled about 3/4 of the way and the rest was foam. Sorry, but every latte I have ever had it was roughly 1/2"" to 3/4"" of the top filled and the rest foam. I told them to fill it up and they said, ""That is how we make them here."" I said, ""Well that's not how a latte is supposed to be. Can you please fill it up?"" And they grumbled. People are right. They appear like they are doing a favor to their customers.  We are paying YOU for a product, not for your attitude. 

The only reason this coffee place is still open is because of the local community's love for small businesses.  If it were not for the Charlestown crowd this place would have closed down long ago."
359,79,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,8/16/2015,"Excellent coffee here, some of the best I've had in the city of Boston. The only thing holding it back is that the breakfast sandwich was good, but not great. That being said, I love the coffee so I'll be there as much as possible."
360,80,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,2/29/2016,"The place where they know your name, and coffee order. 

There's something to be said for walking into a joint where the staff know who you are, and what you want. This place is filled with very friendly and welcoming neighborhood people. The coffee is much better than the Dunk's across the street, and at a similar price point as Starbucks. 

I've tried a number of the breakfast and lunch sandwiches, but my go to order when I'm feeling indulgent is the bagel and lox. Open faced bagel and lox sandwich with capers, red onion, and tomato.

The muffins are spot on as well if you're looking for something a little less than an entire sandwich.

One thing I've noticed is that special orders sometimes get mishandled more times than they should, but mistakes happen, and the staff is always more than happy to rectify the order."
361,81,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,7/8/2012,"Zume's is a great coffeehouse! My friends and I rented a house nearby for a weekend in Boston and this place was conveniently located two blocks from our apartment.

They have some amazing drinks here and the staff is super chill and friendly.  They have plenty of couches and chairs to sit down and unwind.  They also sell local art, which are nicely displayed on their walls."
362,82,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,8/17/2010,"Zume's has very good espresso, latte's, cappuccinos, coffee and teas. Their food menu is very good as well. Muffins, scones, donuts and hot breakfast sandwiches. Very  very good. My only complaint is how expensive it is to come here. Other then that it would be five stars in my book.
Add on to previous review:
I moved Zumes down two starts. Though there coffee and food is very good I've noticed a disturbing decrease in customer service. It seems as if they are frustrated taking your order. 
My fiance' went in the other day to do work on her lap top. As she was setting up her lap top the owner came up to her and told her she had to buy food or coffee to work their. This was before she even had a chance to order anything. He was very rude and spoke to her like someone who was in middle school hanging out. 
Very disappointed in the ownership and his manners."
363,83,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,12/23/2009,"Really cute, cozy place. This is so close to being the ideal neighborhood coffee shop.  Just one problem: snotty staff.

I brought my laptop and went to plug it in and couldn't find any outlets.  I asked the girl at the counter if they had any outlets available and she said, ""no""  (rather curtly).  I then found a hidden outlet and plugged in.  Almost immediately a woman whom I assume to be the owner or manager rushed over to me, taps me on the shoulder and says, ""We DON'T have outlets for a REASON.""  Her tone was snarky and condescending - and she didn't tell me what that REASON was.  I told her my battery was dead so I would have to leave the cafe and go elsewhere. To which she replied, ""OK"".

Her tone was incredibly rude - and that's what turned me off.  

A few other things that tipped the scale to actually make me dislike the place:  I ordered a latte and it was lukewarm, watered-down and less than half full.  I also think its weird to have such a problem with someone wanting to plug in a laptop.

Who knew it as such a crime to plug in your laptop in a cafe.
I won't be going back."
364,84,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,8/26/2009,"I used to be a huge fan of Zumes just until up about a month ago. I was ordering 3 shots of espresso over ice and then adding some milk. After ordering one morning, one of the owners came up to me (while I was talking on my cell phone) and interrupted my conversation to tell me he was going to charge me for a latte the next I came in. I have never had a problem with ordering this drink before at any other cafes...it really turned me off. I have experienced the staff to be rude and not very friendly. When you go into a shop early in the morning a smile would really be nice! 
The reason it gets two stars from me is because their sandwiches are pretty good and they have good desserts and doughnuts."
365,85,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,6/10/2009,"I wish I could say that I love Zume's because I love the concept of it - and I actually do get my coffee there some mornings, and other mornings at Dunkin Donuts. It all depends on whether I feel like  starting my day with a scowl or a smile. Believe it or not, the ruder, less friendly option is at Zume's, not Dunkin Donuts!  The staff don't really seem to enjoy what they do at all.  In this economy, I often leave there thinking, why not let someone who'd actually like to be working do this job?

Why do I bother with Zume's? The coffee is stronger than D&D, and they have some healthy breakfast options. But that's about it.  From my experience, the staff at Zume's seem as though they are doing you the hugest favor by waiting on you at all. I've rarely seen any of them smile, and I often leave there feeling a little bit hassled and like I've just offended them by paying $7 for a coffee, banana, apple and yogurt. 

There is one blonde girl who works at the counter who is pretty sweet, and the woman who makes the food in the back is very nice, but everyone else leaves me cold. There are several people who I literally have never seen crack even the semblance of a smile in the entire year I've been going there. Not the best way to start the day."
366,86,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,6/20/2015,"Great service, great iced coffee. great location. I've been coming here for lunch every once in a while for the last few weeks, and it's a great spot. The breakfast sandwich on an english muffin pushed me over the edge, and onto yelp for the five star review!"
367,87,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,11/21/2010,"Decent food, cute atmosphere (for Charlestown...)...but the staff is RUDE. You walk in and begin to browse the menu and they are like, ""What do you want""...if you tell them you need a minute to decide, they will stare at you until you make up your mind. 
Not the kind of place you want to hang out and read the paper on a Sunday with your coffee. Wish there were more non-chain coffee shops!!!"
368,88,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,3/3/2010,"Found myself in Charlestown and needed to kill some time. We opted for this coffee shop. I really enjoyed sipping coffee here and it makes me think of those days when I lived in Boston and how there was SPACE to just sit and think! LOL. The coffee house has a bit of a Bohemian feel to it, wooden floors, and a few nice chairs. I had a slice of carrot cake and a coffee. The carrot cake was excellent. Moist and flavourful. It was a huge slice and I couldn't finish the whole thing. We were able to sit for about 2 hours with no one trying to kick us out. 

Also, on the day I left Charlestown, my best friend and I went in to grab some breakfast and she was raving about their english muffins. She says they make their own. I tried an egg and cheese on english muffin. She was right. The english muffin was fluffy and light. Better than anything Thomas could ever make ;-) This place is a winner!"
369,89,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,6/2/2014,"Worst customer experience ever - I was recently back to Charlestown after 15 years since moving away. I thought a place like Zume would be a good addition to an otherwise coffee desert. After ordering a coffee I noticed that there were no electrical outlets to charge my dead phone. When I asked, the young lady behind the counter said ""we don't have any customer outlets."" (Strange!)  Then when I pick up my drink I noticed that there was a plug on the back counter with one of the employees phones plugged in. I asked if I could charge my dead phone in that outlet, a manager/owner(?) was called over who told me with a total dead-pan look before walking away: ""that's for employees, we don't have power for customers."" That's it! No ""I'm sorry buts..."", No doing one little favor for a customer... Not the least bit of conciliatory offering what so ever! This place is the worse and deserves to go out of business.

ps: The iced coffee is just OK"
370,0,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,4/4/2022,Veggie tagine!!! Soooo good. It was great to have some yummy hot stewed veggies with Harrissa on a cold day!! Great vegetarian option in Boston. I love this place.
371,1,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,11/28/2021,"Really interested in getting some of the goat in the butcher section next time.

377,7,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,2/12/2021,"I found this place by sheer accident, while I was visiting the Heymarket. As others here mentioned, it is a literally a hole in the wall. Nothing fancy about this store at all, but the meat is always super fresh. For some reason the store often has a bad smell, especially on Friday and Saturday. Not sure what the reason is but be warned. The staff are very welcoming, and the service is quick. I've never been disappointed with any of my purchases here."
378,8,Garden Halal Meat,2 star rating,4/19/2017,"I was very disappointed by the food here. Went in with high expectations to try some good halal food but everything was below average, wasn't worth the wait time and money. 

Tried the chicken platter and it was missing flavor. Also got the sandwich and wasn't impressed by it at all.

Definitely not recommend this place if you have had real halal food before."
379,9,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,6/13/2015,"This morning while shopping at Haymarket I stopped in at Garden Halal Meat. This little ""hole in the wall"" store is located in the basement level but is a haven for incredible meat, fish and Middle Eastern foods.

We ended up buying fresh shrimp, naan as well as some spices. The staff here isn't the most receptive, but they get the job done and for the prices here that is at the bottom of the totem pole of concerns.

Overall, the store is great and it is a go-to location when shopping at Haymarket."
380,10,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,10/12/2018,"this restaurant is my fav one when it comes to Algerian/Morrocan food, they serve really delicious food for cheap prices, they got special plate on friday (Couscous) which is famous traditional algerian plate.

Their meats are freshly cut, and also carry organic chicken. 
My favorite stop when going through that area"
383,13,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,2/16/2015,"The restaurant owners are very nice but a little shy. You can get anything from pizza to shawarma to kabab dinner plates. A kabab dinner cost less than $10 and is still filling. The kicker is the restaurant is open until 2am most days!

The shop under the restaurant has chicken ~$2/lb and red meat ~4/lb and the meat is fresh. Lots of exotic fruit juices and the spices are good quality. 

Worth the visit!"
384,14,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,1/4/2013,"Like Don W., I am reviewing the store underneath the restaurant, which is not marked and looks rather sketchy as you descend down into the dark, but it is brimming with all kinds of well priced items and a couple of misplaced pigeons. 

Garden Halal is not just a meat store. (I do not eat any meat at all and got lots of items here.) The butcher, the baker, the fishmonger and the olive grower all contribute to the huge assortment of products. You can scoop up a varied selection of olives, find well priced, authentic Nutella (the one in the glass jar- much better) and pick up some lentils, huge jars of spices, cookies, pastries or even some cooked shrimp. (Their fresh fish looks fine, but I have not purchased any yet, out of loyalty to New Deal.) If you like good prices, independently owned specialty markets and lots of choices, you need to make this a destination next time you are in the vicinity of Haymarket or Government Center. 

Based on the number of people down here on my first visit, this place is a hidden jewel with much to explore. It's right near Harry's Cheese Shop (also a treasure) and there are two entrances, but they are not well marked. Descend you must. Just don't trip over the pigeons who mix, mingle and coo around the boots and shoes of us busy shoppers."
385,15,Garden Halal Meat,3 star rating,4/16/2017,"This is a difficult rating for me to give them. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma wrap ($6.99) to go. Then I sat there waiting for about 10 minutes, wondering what was going on. I could see the guy behind the counter, but he didn't look like he was doing anything about my order. After a while, I realized he must've been cooking the chicken in the back. After a while I saw him pick up a wrap (not a pita wrap though; some sort of weird hybrid between a tortilla and pita), and then start asking me which toppings I wanted (lettuce, tomatoes, olives, onions). And then he asked me if I wanted mayo or ranch. Stop. I'm sorry, did you say MAYO and RANCH?! Do you think I'm some kind of uncultured buffoon? Hell no, I'm not putting that in my wrap. So I told him no, and started feeling a little off-put. He started wrapping up my order, and I realized I never saw him add tzatziki sauce (which was on the description of my order, and lets be real, basically makes or breaks any Greek-style order). Which I asked him. And he replied, ""we don't have any"". We don't have any as in we are out, or as in it has never set foot in our store?? Then he asked me again if I wanted mayo or ranch. Still said no to that one. So I left the place feeling slighted. I feel like that's something he should've said at the beginning. It's quite simple: ""we don't have any tzatziki sauce, is that okay?"" Because honestly, I would've gone someplace else! I don't want a dry Chicken chicken Shawarma! Which it was. Don't mistake me, the meat was very good; well-seasoned and tender, but it didn't taste very authentic (not that ranch or mayo would've fixed that ), and every bite I took made me feel like I'd lost an opportunity to eat a delicious meal. It ruined the experience for me. In that regards, I rate the quality and taste of the food (4/5). I've had better, but it was good. And customer service gets a (2/5). That just really hit me hard. Particularly since I'm in town visiting, it's not as if I can just go back next week and get it again, with tzatziki (not that they're guaranteed to have any, since apparently ""we don't have any"" is the new ambiguous response""). And I feel like my 7 bucks fell short. Anyways, moral of the novella: ASK IF THEY HAVE TZATZIKI BEFORE YOU ORDER."
386,16,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,8/6/2015,"great hole in the wall restaurant. Food is delicious, filling and affordable. They have a $10 credit card minimum so remember to bring cash. Service is friendly. Don't come expecting constant check ups but they do take care. Will definitely come back."
387,17,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,5/8/2010,"Garden Halal has a secret.  Underneath the restaurant is the store and this is a review of the store.  There's no sign that I could see, but the packages of food all say Garden Halal Market.  There are tons of Middle Eastern goodies, a Halal butcher, and my favorite: a fish counter with some really good prices!  We just picked up some gorgeous tuna steaks for $4.99/lb.  Come here on a Saturday, buy everything but the vegetables here and then go outside and finish your shopping.  You'll pay about half as much as you'd pay in the supermarket.

And if you're a tourist staying somewhere near Faneuil Hall, this is a good place to pick up some snacks and it's the side of Boston that doesn't have the ""Lobstah"" and ""Hahvahd"" t-shirts."
388,18,Garden Halal Meat,3 star rating,8/5/2009,"We discovered Garden Halal as if it dropped from the sky. As North End residents, we often tire of Italian cuisine. Sometimes we just want a good sandwich or shawarma. It was about 9 pm and all the shawarma restaurants we could think of were probably already closed or not within walking distance. We just about gave up and went to Hot Tomatoes when we spotted Garden Halal's neon sign in the distance. Lo and behold, a shawarma restaurant!

Garden Halal is basically a take out place/deli. Its menu has sections for Somali cuisine, Italian-style subs & pizza (slices are pretty cheap - $1.25 to $1.75 including Halal pepperoni), and shawarma. The deli had various salads, two chicken dishes, rice, some curry-type dishes. 

We each had beef shawarma sandwiches. It took a long time for them to make it--each beef strip is freshly grilled. (Unlike Boston Shawarma on Huntington, where the beef is already cooked). In addition to generous strips of beef, the sandwiches have fresh cilantro, tomato, garlic, and onion. There was very little dressing/sauce--pretty dry.  Each was $6 (tax incl.)

We also ordered a side of carrots. The carrots were cooked soft, chilled and marinated with cilantro, mint, olive oil, and vinegar. The side was $3.25 (tax incl.)

All in all, it was pretty good, and a nice alternative to eating Italian."

It can be tough to find halal restaurants when traveling, but Garden Halal came to my rescue!

0,0,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,5 star rating,5/14/2016,"I feel obligated to give Kipos 5 stars because there is no way on Earth (or any other planet for that matter) that it deserves an overall rating under 4 stars. 

After reading all the reviews for Kipos, I was very apprehensive to check it out. 1.5 stars, really? It can't be that bad. If it wasn't for my close proximity, I probably would've just skipped it, but I'm so glad I didn't. 

First off, when I walked in the door, the sweet older gentleman and his presumptive wife were in there, MAKING THE DOUGH FROM SCRATCH! THIS IS NOT A TYPO! This alone should warrant a couple stars! You don't find your local Dominos putting in this kind of effort. 

They have a pretty extensive menu, but being primarily a pizza joint, I decided to try a calzone. I got the chicken parm calzone and let's just say this thing was a monster. For 11 bucks, you get a monster calzone that barely fit in the box! 

Once I sprinted home to sink my mitts and fangs into this monstrosity I had to cut it in half because it was so darn big. This allowed me to get a cross sectional view of all the delicious insides of this beast. It was loaded down with cheese and sauce and chicken, and I mean loaded down. Everything tasted so hot and fresh, I feel like what I got was in a different universe from that I was expecting after reading the previous reviews. 

There's no doubt I'll be going back, and now not just out of sheer convenience but because Kipos is awesome! A local place like Kipos that has been around in Charlestown for a while is right in my wheelhouse for places I love. Support local!"

6,6,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,2 star rating,2/18/2018,"Tasteless pizza ... Legit. Subs are ok , calzones are like meat encased in a heavy brick of dough, cold cuts are good , the fries are probably the best thing they have , chicken fingers are gamey and rubbery tasting.  The clientele is mostly young kids which probably explains its surprising longevity in the area."
7,7,Kipos Pizzeria & Restaurant,1 star rating,7/28/2010,"Stop. Just stop right there. Who are you people? They USED to have bad pizza? 3 stars? 4 stars?!! Stop it!

Look, this isn't about pizza snobbery. I've had good pizza, and I've had mediocre pizza. But I love pizza in nearly every form. Those little frozen pizza bagels are fantastic to me! Even the greasiest late night bar crawl pizza is still tasty because it's pizza! People groan about Hi-Fi in Central Square, Cambridge. Sure it's not GREAT pizza... but it's still pizza and it's still tasty. Soggy, crispy, deep dish, thin crust, burnt, greasy, rubbery... I've endured it all and I've gone back for seconds. I love pizza. Who doesn't?

Kipos should not exist. This was, by far, the worst pizza I've ever had in my entire life... fresh... frozen... or otherwise. I couldn't even understand it. My brain simply could not fathom how a business could sell this and call it brick oven pizza. How can a business sell this and maintain a customer base? How are they making their money? Somebody has to explain this to me!

First of all, the establishment is a wreck. Ceiling fans hanging by wires, chairs and boxes piled up in the back like they're on their way to the dump, but they're not... they're covered in dust. It's as though this is some sort of sorrowful tribute to a bygone era. There's even an arcade machine sitting unplugged and covered in dust.

I ordered a large cheese pizza. The most simple of pies. They reached under the counter... shuffled a bit... and out came a pie, in mere seconds. It looked frozen, perhaps... I honestly can't say. But it was not made from anything fresh. My thoughts? Even frozen pizza is kind of ok... so I'll go with it.

I'm not the type of person to refuse to pay for an ordered meal... but man, in this case I wish I was. This pizza was awful. Thin little slices of  cardboard with crusty cheese on them. You could hold the slice vertically and nothing would move. You could throw it like a frisbee (I actually made the motion vigorously with a slice) and none of the ingredients moved. It wouldn't bend, flop, slide, or drip. This is NOT pizza. It reminded me of that scene in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation when the turkey explodes... and they're all sitting around eating these little nuclear bits of crispy flesh.

Seriously guys... maybe it's run by a family of good people. But don't support this mess. They're not even trying. These good people need to move on and run something easier like an ice cream stand. They do sell ice cream here. Maybe that's where their bread and butter lies."

10,0,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,4/3/2022,"I don't reside in Boston, so my reviews tend to be of the places I love.  Caffe Vittoria is such a place.  A visit to Caffe Vittoria is a bit like stepping back in time to the 1930's.  It is also assuredly an opportunity to enjoy the best cappuccino in the USA.   

Service is not always consistent, so don't be in a rush.  It's ok to take your time and savor things."
11,1,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,1/12/2022,"Best. Cappuccino. Ever. 

I visited Boston from the SF Bay Area and really enjoyed the ambiance + coffee here. The powder on top elevated the drink a lot - subtle chocolate flavor lightly sweetened with the frothiness of the milk. 

Super yummy and would be such a great spot for a date or a drink with friends!"
12,2,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,12/16/2021,"I visit the cafe whenever I walk through the north end and it was a cute place! There were no issues being seated, but do expect indoors to be loud and crowded on weekend evenings. If you'd like a quieter experience, I recommend visiting earlier in the day. That being said, The BEST tiramisu in town. The espresso martini's are good, as well as the cappuccino.

Some things about the cafe:
-Have cash on hand
-it seems to be open pretty late, which is a plus factor.
-I'm not sure if it's because the building is old but there's an almost smoke like smell engrained into the building and walls. It reeks, almost like cigars, but there's no smoking allowed indoors so I'm not sure where it comes from. It's the biggest factor of why I don't like being in there too long. I eat my tiramisu and martini and leave asap.
-Due to the nature of the building being old, it seems they haven't renovated their bathrooms. There's holes in the walls in the bathrooms, which is creepy to say the least. 

Overall, they can preserve the buildings history while still making upgrades that would help out the cafe tons I'm sure. Still, good food and drinks and worth a stop when in the north end."
13,3,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/21/2022,So cute. Old school vibe with lots of locals. Friendly service -- all the espresso perfect for after a hearty Italian meal. almond milk cappuccino was perfect and the tiramisu was gone in 60 seconds. Perfect balance and not too sweet. I hear they have the best espresso martini :)

16,6,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,11/28/2021,"A pretty cool ass cafe. Cafe Vittoria is a place to sip on some coffee or something more strong if you prefer a liquor. It has a pretty small menu of classy pastries and expensive things. Everything isn't extremely expensive though but it's more costly than a typical bakery. They also have desserts like sorbet. 

It doesn't have that much of a menu. Mostly it seems to be desserts and few things in the way of entrees and such. This is pretty much where to come after you've already eaten out and lie about being too full for dessert there. Coffee is a beverage of choice. There's also plenty of the classy hard stuff. I'm a Ladies Man so I get my Courvoisier. Please tell me you got the SNL reference there. It's $10 for a pour. They also have a Lemon Sorbet. It's $7 for a cup. This is fluffier than most sorbets. It has a light tartness that's not overwhelming or bitter. The only bad thing is it melts pretty fast so eat fast. 

A good place for classy desserts. It also has coffee and cognacs to sip on. The sorbet is the best palette cleanser so get it to finish up."
17,7,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,11/7/2021,"Stopped in for a cappuccino and walked out with a smile!

This CASH ONLY cafe knows how to do things right here. Their artistic creations brings happiness along with your drink.

This place is located on a very busy street so the crowd tends to shuffle in and spend some time enjoying the menu items."
18,8,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,12/5/2021,"Stopped by after dinner in the North End for some desserts and drinks on a Saturday night. This place was packed, but thankfully there are several floors so we were seated pretty quickly in the basement level.

Their menu is pretty expansive with a full bar and pretty much every coffee drink combination you could hope for. I got a mocha and flan for dessert. Upstairs vibe was loud, eclectic cafe x bar energy. Downstairs felt more like a pub with dark lighting, booths, woodsy interiors, and fewer people. Service was a bit slow, but to be expected due to the time.

Mocha was great and flan was rich and dense. Nice place to chat with friends and stay warm post dinner if you're not ready to head home yet. 

As a heads up, they were closing the basement level around 9:30pm on a Saturday and pretty much ushered us out (or we could have gone upstairs to wait for another table where it was really crowded). Something to keep in mind if you want to go chill here for a while. Also was cash only."
19,9,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,2/9/2022,"I absolutely love this cafe! This is a cash only place, and like most of North End establishments, it is pretty small so it can be a tight squeeze seating-wise. The inside is so cute, it's like being in an antique shop (in the best way!). Not to mention, their sweets are soo good. The tiramisu was perfection - not too sweet and had the right consistency. The limoncello mascarpone was on the sweeter side and also incredibly delicious."
20,10,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/15/2022,"BEST TIRAMISU EVER!! Come here after dinner for an amazing dessert. Its so light and fluffy, we had to order a second one it was so good."
21,11,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,11/12/2021,"Splendid.

Even though I do not drink coffee, I can tell their drinks are rich in flavor. They are also whimsical in appearance, fair in price, and vintage in name.

Whether you are going for an early morning pick me up, or that late night hopper, this is unparalleled value. Hard working ladies will ensure that you enjoy your hot beverage against the backdrop of 1940's and 1950's crooners swooning you with old favorites. It was a really special and unique experience that you can have too if you bring cash (sorry, no credit cards here folks). 

The best part was seeing customers recycle in and out. It seems people always want to be a part of something special here.

No wonder, because this cafe is something special."
22,12,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,4/6/2022,Best coffee in the North End.  They are cash only so just be aware of that when you go.
23,13,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,1/21/2022,"We stopped in to get out of the cold and grab some caffeine after an afternoon of shopping. Our small group had cappuccinos and sfogliatella. Service was a bit slow, but we understand it was very busy. Be aware that it is cash-only, tables are very close to each other, and the staff wear their masks under their chins (and do not respect personal boundaries, even after we asked nicely that they keep a little bit of distance). There is no excuse for being rude to customers and I'm sure there are other cafes with good cappuccinos in the area. (visited 11/7/15 and 12/31/21)"
24,14,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,9/6/2021,"By far my favorite cafe in North End! SUCH a cute shop with gorgeous interior design-- I love how they have old coffee machines/grinders and rustic framed posters. If you catch a spot by the window, you can get some natural sunlight and people watch. I came here 3 times during my one week Boston trip! 

Over three visit, I've tried their famous cappuccino, cannoli, tiramisu, iced latte, and americano. My favorite drink is the cappuccino and favorite dessert is the tiramisu by far. No complaints about the cappuccino-- the portion size was also quite large! Although the cannoli was very delicious already (especially dipped in the cappuccino!), their tiramisu is the best I've ever had. The flavor was so rich and I could really taste strong espresso in the soaked layers of cake. 

A perfect place to chill with a book, journal, or catch up with a friend, highly recommend!"
25,15,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/29/2021,"OMG! This has become my favorite haunt in North End. 

My friends and I all agreed that this place boasts the best tiramisu we've ever had. The first time we came, we split one slice and collectively finished it in about 30 seconds lol. My friend said he really liked the cannolis here too.

My favorite part of this shop is how their menu complements each other. I'd recommend pairing their pastries with a coffee drink with no sugar added, as the natural bitterness of espresso acts as a great palate cleanser in between bites of their sweet, creamy pastries. 

I was also a big fan of the venue, with seats next to their street-side windows. The natural sunlight here in the morning is great. 

Just be warned that this cafe, like most places in North End, is cash only, so come prepared! You definitely don't want to miss out."
26,16,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,12/18/2021,"Super cute place (very in the Christmas spirit when we went), very busy on a Saturday night, and they are CASH ONLY (but very fairly priced). We only tried the gelato which was delicious. I would love to go back and try their coffees and pastries as they also looked really good."
27,17,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,9/24/2021,"100% recommend!!! This was a highlight of our trip. To sit at a small Italian cafe (in the heart of little Italy) and be surrounded by individuals speaking the language helped us realize we were in for a treat. 

We ordered cappuccinos along with a slice of tiramisu. WOWOW... my mouth is watering thinking about it."
28,18,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,7/19/2021,"A quaint little spot to grab an Italian coffee and pastry. I especially loved seeing all of the espresso machines that the caffe has collected to display.

This caffe really reminded me of being back in Italy. You could walk into a bar, grab a quick coffee, say hello to friends, and then run off to continue your day. At Caffe Vittoria, much of the same was happening. Locals were stopping in to say hello and get their morning coffee. 

We stopped in hoping to enjoy breakfast pastries and a coffee. We have young children, and this isn't an ideal place to stop if you're worried about getting them something to eat also. The pastries are all rather dessert-like, except of course the biscotti. 

We ordered a cappuccino, americano, and a Napelatano. The pastry was yummy and very rich. The coffees were perfect. It's definitely a great place to stop for a coffee break and to have a seat and watch some of the world go by."
29,19,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/3/2021,"Located next to Mike's pastry. FYI do not eat your pastries from Mike's  if you order drinks etc. Not allowed. 

Nice service and we enjoyed our coffees."
30,20,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/21/2022,"I only wanted coffee! My daughter ordered the pastry for herself and it was so huge. As a mom, I had to help her. We're both so grateful. Wowza!"
31,21,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,7/6/2021,"This was a stop on a food tour and was the ""star of the show"" - cannoli in the opinion of the host was best in all of North End and after having one I could not disagree.  These are not mass produced like some of well known offerings on Hanover.  Not to say they aren't worthy of a stop but each city has those stops that are ""iconic"" but to locals you will find that better offerings are there for the taking (think cheesesteak in Philly, BBQ in Texas, Meixcan food in SoCal - there are well known spots and then the spots that the locals go to have that offering.  

Caffe Vittoria is that place for cannoli - the roll is crispy and not soggy due to pre-filled cheese.  The ricotta cheese is piped in AFTER shell is baked as it should be.  Best bite I had in Boston over the July 4th weekend.  Best sip you ask?  Oh why it was the cappucino here as well.  It was perfect temperature, silky and luscious with each sip.  I will definitely go back here next time around because of this cannoi and cappucino - it was that memorable - an easy 5 stars - don't even have to think about it - the mind doesn't come into it at all - just the taste."
32,22,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,7/17/2021,"My favorite place I visited while in Boston. This quaint, authentic cafe left nothing to be desired. We needed an afternoon pick me up, the cafe Vittoria delivered. We got iced lattes and a scoop of ice cream.

My favorite ice cream is Spumoni and only the authentic Italian places have the good stuff. I was delighted when I found out they offered it. It was so delicious and they drizzled a cherry sauce on top. The iced latte was just what we needed to continue our day - delicious, creamy and topped with coffee beans and chocolate shavings. 

Do yourself a favor and stop in here and enjoy one of the best places I've been to in a long time."
33,23,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/11/2022,"I will just say one word: TIRAMISU

34,24,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,11/29/2021,"As much delicious food as there is to be had in the North End, coffee is a must for me.  Lavazza cappuccino with a delicious creama hit the spot!!  It was in the 30s and we'd been walking around for a little while.  This was my second visit - the place seems to be packed all the time.  It's crowded and loud.  I love every bit of it.  Our waitress was friendly, despite being very busy."
35,25,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,1/23/2022,"FYI: Cash Only! There is a sign outside, but somehow we missed it when walking in. We just stopped in for a Cafe Macchiato and Hot Chocolate and it was really delicious!"
36,26,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,11/8/2021,"Wonderful cafe in the North End. Solid gelato and coffee choices, as well as some alcoholic beverages. We tried the Caffe Mocha and it was wonderful. Service can be a little slow, but definitely worth the stop for an afternoon pick me up as a place to stop and rest before heading out again."
37,27,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,4/11/2021,"My friend and I came on a weekend morning for a sweet treat. The main room was full when we arrived, so we were seated in this back room with a perfect view of the trash barrels outside . I was surprised that the menu didn't have any prices, which made ordering pretty annoying.

We ordered an eclair and tiramisu to share. The eclair was nothing to write home about. It was cold, and the shell was kind of rubbery. The tiramisu, however, was absolutely delicious! It was actually the best tiramisu I've ever had! There wasn't an overwhelming amount of powder on top, and it was the perfect sweetness and texture! 

The service wasn't great though. The waitress barely came by. We wanted to order a second tiramisu, but literally an hour passed since she last checked on us. We literally had to ask for a check while she was finishing taking another table's order - or else who knows when she would come next. She also gave us the wrong receipt.

Overall, we loved the tiramisu and would've gladly gotten a second one. The poor service made the overall experience an okay-ish one. I doubt we'll be back to dine in - I'll try to grab a tiramisu for take out next time."
38,28,Caffé Vittoria,2 star rating,10/17/2021,"This was a definite miss for me. We had mediocre service, it was cash only, and my hazelnut latte was flavorless. 

It doesn't have a cute vibe or anything to make up for the downsides, so I'd look for another place for coffee instead."
39,29,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,10/9/2021,"Arrived on Saturday evening and instantly regretted it because this place was packed. We tried to find a table inside (failed) and then walked out disappointed. I find it curious none of the staff indoors let customers know that there are more seats in the other side of the cafe, which has its own separate entrance, counter, AND bathroom (you could easily mistake it for a restaurant next door). People often enter the side closer to the big white rectangular sign, see the tightly packed marble tables, and walk back out but I can assure you that right next to that entrance is another entrance that will lead to an entirely different lounge with bigger tables. 

I'm giving one star this time because after we failed to find a table for 4 indoors, we took a patio table. Someone came by to take our order while I had left to view the gelato flavors, but afterwards, no one came to take our order again. We tried to request a wait staff from the inside know that our table as well as all the other patio tables were ready to order. When I spoke with the counter staff to see if they could communicate someone to come outside, they stated they would be out but still no one came. We must've waited 20 minutes until we discovered the other lounge and sat at a table indoors yet again. Still no one came, even after it was obvious we had just sat at the back lounge. I spoke to 3 separate staff members to take our order, but it was not until I really took ahold of one by the counter, explaing that we had been waiting a while, that they finally sent someone over to our back table to take our order.  I most definitely understand the struggle of being shortstaffed during peak times and especially during the pandemic, but come on.... there was no apology. There was no ""Thank you for your patience."" Not acceptable. The gelato also came out half melted (not pictured), which was such a contrast to the gelato I was served when I first visited (see photos). This second visit left such a sour taste in my mouth that I don't think I'll be recommending this place to my friends and other locals again."
40,30,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,4/4/2022,"Horrible service.  Servers have an attitude, walked past us more than once to stand and take out their phones.  No smiles, which if you expect a tip you've got to earn it. Disappointing as I had heard so many good things about the espresso martinis.  Beverage itself was good, but didn't get positive vibes from the wait staff"
41,31,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/17/2021,"The ancestors would be very glad dropped by to be frank. It's old school in a good way. Staff is friendly and with Covid I'm sure they are having a time. You can use the QR code for the menu.
I'll tell you this kids I could sit here all day and try all the sweets. I got here before noon cause no true Italian has cappuccino after noon time as it's a breakfast drink. It's beautifully made and hits the spot. The tiramisu was just right not too much of it a nice slice actually if I were you and you were with others order ones for each of you. Most places in the states done really know how to make it.. here it was smooth and creamy.

The inside is lovely it reminds me of this spot I use to go to in Rome. You see the huge copper looking espresso machine.

A FEW THINGS

1)DO NOT BRING STUFF FROM MIKES NEXT DOOR 

2) CASH ONLY

Parking are you for real...it's Lil Italy you can't park right here but it's a 10 walk from the North Station Commuter Train"
42,32,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/17/2021,"This is right next Mike's pastries. The entrance is a bit hidden so just look closely. 
They could improve on their advertising by having their name in a big easel board in front of their store. Also, they need to showcase their pastries better.  These are homemade pastries! To see what they offer, i had to go near the bathroom and take a look. They are inside a fridge and it is not well lit...sigh!! Much can be improved. 
The coffee, hot chocolate and lobster tail was delicious! So yes, i do recommend this place."
43,33,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,1/19/2022,Cute little spot in North End.  Easy ordering at the tables.  We got a couple of hot chocolates to escape the rain and really loved the decor and the drinks.  Will be back!
44,34,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/12/2021,Busy! Cappuccino macchiato and cannoli. We sat outside. Perfection ! Only thing that could use improvement? The way you get an outside seat. It's not clear if you wait or ask.
45,35,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,1/28/2021,"Hot chocolate was just what I needed today with all the snow flurries! My roommate and I love exploring new places in Boston and after coming to this cafe, we will definitely be returning. What's really cool is that it's Boston's first Italian cafe! The decor inside fits the vibe perfectly.

My roommate and I both tried the 'Sleigh Ride' which is hot chocolate with Godiva chocolate and Baileys. It was delicious! The one down side to this cafe is that it is cash only and we didn't know this before we left the apartment. I never carry cash on me, but luckily my roommate had just enough for the drinks. If we had known, we would have brought more cash and tried some of the pastries!"
46,36,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,9/24/2021,I came here at night for the espresso martini and a cannoli. The martini was super good and strong as well. The cannoli filling was sooo good.

47,37,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,1/13/2021,"Covid review:

I came here in August. 

Cash only !

I love the decor so much.  The coffee and cannolli are basic. Sorry ill say it. The cannoli cream is home made but I can get better down the block. The coffee was okay.  We had some grappa, which was so nice !  Good service too. Overall its a cute spot to sit down and relax for a minute, take in all the cute decor and history."
48,38,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,2/6/2021,"Went to Caffe Vittoria to try their famous limoncello cake slice and it was a hit! This beautiful Italian cafe takes you out of Boston and immediately transports you to Italy. Everything in the caffe makes you feel as if you are somewhere in Europe. The decor and old  coffee machine scattered around the cafe are entertaining to look at. This place is also HUGE I thought it was small, but if you walk to the end of the hall there is a loop that takes you to a different room with more tables and old decor. I would say this is an experience type of coffee place. 

The limoncello cake was a fluffy decadence. It was moist  and the mascarpone icing blends well with this moist cake. I loved the experience!"
49,39,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,6/15/2021,My companion and I were walking through the North End section of Boston and decided on a whim to stop in Caffe Victoria for a cappuccino.  It was the best decision of our day!  We loved the authenticity of the cafe.  There were people chatting in both English and Italian....which added to the experience.  The cappuccino was by far THE BEST we've ever had.  Perfect!  A must when in Boston!
50,40,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,12/13/2021,"This cafe was one of the highlights of our trip. Delicious coffees and desserts with cute vintage decor. We especially enjoyed the cappuccino and tiramisu.

51,41,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,6/13/2021,"Cash Only. When I went here I felt I was teleported back in time, it has a very old-time classic European cafe feel. Everything is very affordable, we got two teas (they use hot water and tea bags) and tiramisu, both very good"
52,42,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,2/4/2022,"Stopped here for hot cocoa during a rainy day. Delicious cocoa and great presentation. They also had the most appetizing desserts.

53,43,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,11/19/2021,"Latte was good, ambiance is good as well. The back part not so, only because it smells like cigar, other than that, the vibe is very Italy! Less a star since they only accept cash and wont allow you to eat anything else, like the cannoli in the picture. As a tourist, we are disappointed."
54,44,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,9/28/2021,"Delicious coffee, dessert and very kitschy atmosphere that makes you feel like you're in Europe. Very nice spot for after dinner. I highly recommend caffe coretto with Fernet Branca. Cheesecake is gluten free if you don't eat the crust, and quite good. Reasonable prices, cash only, service is very casual, so don't be in a hurry."
55,45,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,4/2/2021,"Love Vittoria! I am in the neighborhood a lot, and this is the place we bring folks who are visiting us or we will go just because!  My favorite drink is the hot coco, hands down.  The pastry is always fresh and delicious and would rather be seated at old world charm Vittoria than any other coffee place in the N. End.  Suggestion is that the app menu have a full menu listing of what is offered and have prices of what is offered.  Staff are pretty nice and the place can be extremely busy. It is cash only, prices and full menu please."
56,46,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,8/22/2020,"The espresso martini was good. Tiramisu was only ok nothing more( although we heard amazing reviews on it).
The hazelnut ice cream was good but the pistachio was really not good, it didn't have the flavor of pistachio. This place takes only cash. There are seats inside and outside. I would give this place 3/5 also for social distancing."
57,47,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,1/25/2022,"This place was such a vibe. The whole place was packed with groups of people and the ambiance was super loud. We had to seat ourselves and wait for a waiter to approach us to take our order. For me this place wasn't much for the desserts or drinks they offered but the ambiance, although their desserts are pretty great too. We had so much fun just sitting there and being as loud without getting eyed by people and enjoying our treats. I loved the tiramisu, cotton candy gelato, and the cannoli. Only downside is that you'll probably have to wait forever to get your order taken and getting served. We went on a Monday night and it was full to the point that people were waiting outside in the line to get in."
58,48,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,1/17/2022,Honestly? BEST latte I've probably had from any restaurant. Just add one packet of sugar (obviously your preference) and your set. The place is small but definitely has such a Italian coffee shop vibe. Will continue to go back over and over (:

For a pastry i ordered the Chocolate Gannoche and my wife had the Tiramisu. He dessert didn't have the rum fflavor typical of Tiramisu and it was small. My dessert was pretty good. So was the Cappuccino. The total was $16.00. The only thing we were not satisfied with was the waitress. Our waitress walked over and just looked at us with a blank stare. We were the ones who had to engage her. She did not smile and was extremely impersonal. A real drag."
60,50,Caffé Vittoria,2 star rating,5/17/2021,"My wife and I were in the area and were looking for a little pick me up before our tour started later in the afternoon. We walked in and stood near the doorway before the waitstaff acknowledged us and finally told us to have a seat at any table. I ordered the cappuccino and my wife had the chinotto (Italian soda). It didn't take long for us to be ready to go, but the waitstaff never came to check on us again after being served the drinks. It got to the point where I went up to the counter to get the bill and pay just so that we could leave at a reasonable time. It was not a busy day, and I could see several waitresses playing on their phones instead of ensuring their customers were taken care of. While the drinks were tasty, if this is the typical experience Caffe Vittoria has to offer, I'd recommend taking your money elsewhere."

We bought some cannolis at Mike's Pastries and came inside with them and were ready to order.  We said we'd like to eat them outside and asked for outside seating, then were told to go outside and wait to be served. Fifteen minutes later we still had no one helping us so we went back inside and then were told again to go outside and wait to be served. Over ten minutes later no one came. Another party who came was instantly served when they sat down. By the time they came to us we had been waiting 30 minutes.  Upon asking for our order we were told there was a policy against eating outside food.... We should have left after waiting ten minutes but the reviews seemed very good.  In any case we were very annoyed at the lack of attention and just decided to leave."
64,54,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/28/2020,"Coffee in America has been morphed into a fast food experience where you wait in a line and receive a paper cup bearing your misspelled name. Coffee was meant to be drank in leisure over conversation while digesting an exquisite meal. The coffee should be meticulously crafted with quality ingredients and served in a cup that's not destined for a recycling bin the moment after you've taken your final sip. It should be enjoyed in an environment that is both lively and without a trace of precipitancy. The right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have, and a wonderful place to spend it is at Caffé Vittoria with spectacular coffee and companionship."
65,55,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/3/2021,"After searching for a aesthetically pleasing coffee shop online, I stumbled upon this one as well as a friend recommending it. It was a busy spot! But was such a cute shop to grab an iced coffee and dessert with some friends."

Narrow inside with a few tables, along with outdoor seating. All old school coffee machines, some of which they still use! Service is fast and there is always a barista on hand to take your order. All drinks can be made iced, which is a selling point in my book. No extra charge for soy or almond milk, which is another selling point.

Definitely more of a grab and go type place with excellent coffee and even better prices. Two iced lattes with soy for $4!"

69,59,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,7/6/2021,"I come here whenever I bring guests to the North End. It's a cozy, aesthetic place on the popular Hanover Street. 

The gelato is really rich, very delicious. The flavor is concentrated goodness. Everyone always enjoys the gelato. They give you tiny spoons so that you really savor every tiny bite. The drinks that I've had are also great, particularly the iced mocha. 

If you order an ice water, don't expect it to come quickly, but service is otherwise pretty fast. Cash only. I don't think they have prices for anything on the menu but everything drink or gelato that I've had is $4-5."

Tiramisu was very good and the latte was great as well. Not too pricey but note that this place is cash only!

The inside has a louder than coffee shop chatter but lots of seating and really like how they set this place up.

My only caveat here is that the
moment we entered the cafe and while sitting inside the staff were a quite aggressive. Perhaps it was because it was the end of the night and they were ready to close, I don't know but that was not exactly the cafe experience I expected."

GET THE TIRAMISU!

I've had many tiramisus before and have also tried making it myself before too. Lemme tell ya, it's hard to perfect! This place holds #1 for the best tiramisu I've ever had. I tried to pace myself but it was gone in 5 minutes. The cappuccino was great too. Smooth, velvety, foamy on top with a decadent chocolate sauce on top. 

When you enter you can sit down wherever you'd like and someone will help you with your order. After you are done with your food/beverage they will give you a bill. This place is cash only so make sure you have some cash on you!"

75,65,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,9/9/2021,"A really cute cafe that my partner and I visited while we were waiting for our table in the area. It's cash only, and normally I wouldn't mess with a cash only business but tbh the coffee and pastries here are worth it. I got a latte and a dessert and it was fantastic! The atmosphere is amazing and the service is so nice. Couldn't recommend more."
76,66,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,10/24/2021,"Interior is very cool and different. Lots of foot traffic so definitely not a study area, more of a sit and chat area. I was told this was a must visit if you were in Boston. Coffee is decorated really uniquely, but tastes like your typical coffee. Smooth and not too sweet. We got the cappuccino and mocha. Only downside was that service was very slow, and no one really gave us a heads up about that. We sort of just sat and waited for twenty ish minutes. Also, they don't take card, only cash."
77,67,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,8/9/2020,"Classic Italian cafe with coffee and pastries. Cappuccino and iced coffee were excellent. Pastries were decent, not spectacular."
78,68,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,5/25/2021,"Great coffee both hot & ice, pretty much like what I had in Italy. Tiramisu and cannoli were also pretty tasty but not too sweet."
79,69,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,10/3/2019,"We ended up in this place for Limoncello and espresso after a fantastic dinner in Giacomos (they actually recommended us Caffe Vittoria, thank you!!!!) The place had that rustic and vintage. Seems a lot like a little cafe in Italy. We will be back!

Be aware, cash only. And musicians sometime around playing, so you might want to have cash too to tip them, they are amazing"
80,70,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,4/1/2021,"Let me tell you !!! I am not a fan of tiramisu, but the lady ( who I wish I knew her name ) recommended  it and I was like I guess I'll try. This was by far the best tiramisu I ever had . I had to order two ! We came after dinner here and it was busy , but no wait which was awesome. Also the drinks are pretty strong here , most of them are dessert type drinks."
81,71,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,6/30/2020,"Super nice place!! Great quality coffee! And awesome desserts!! We ordered 3 different ones because we couldn't choose just one :) tiramisu is amazing! And that was my first time trying lobster tail (for that reason I can't compare it to anything) buuuut highly recommended!!
Oh, and it's cash only place, so don't forget to bring your dollar bills :)"
82,72,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/12/2019,"For my experience, I really enjoyed ! Good spot to sit with opened-windows & friendly service. Of course, our local friends recommended & we loved it!  The whole area is so ""Little Italy""...atmospheric feel. 
It's CA$H only business !!! 
We got...coffee, espresso, cannoli, gelato, tiramisu...everything is held up its recommendations!"
83,73,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/30/2019,"Loved going to this little cafe after eating dinner in the North End. We paid $10 for 2 desserts plus tip, and were not disappointed. The tiramisu I ordered was creamy and delicious! The atmosphere of the cafe is very ""vintage Italy"", and is cute and cozy. I can't wait to take my friends/family here when they visit from out-of-state.

Service was great, but remember it's cash only!"
84,74,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,8/4/2019,"4.5 stars

Caffé Vittoria is a North End gem. Step in and you'll be transported to an old-timey Italian coffee shop that looks straight out a movie. The walls are lined with vintage memorabilia and oldies play in the background.

The price point is about right. I usually go for the cappuccino (dusted with cinnamon) and the tiramisu (fluffy and decadent). I tried a bite of my bf's strawberry cheesecake which was good (but surprisingly salty).

Half a star lost for service. Often times, it can be hard to flag down somebody to take your order."
85,75,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,6/19/2019,"A Large Hot Coffee from Caffe Vittoria. Extra Strong. The Stuff will put you on Mars... $3.50 well worth it.

I will have to go to Caffe Vittoria the next time i'm in the North End and try some of their Baked Tasty Goods.. Oh Yeah..!

Caffe Vittoria is also Wheelchair accessible although there is no power door. There is a steep Ramp to the door, so you will need help.

Inside be aware Caffe Vittoria space wise is a bit tight. But there is enough for a wheelchair to navigate the Space and the Staff is very accommodating. 

Note: Caffe Vittoria also has a Hidden tiny Vintage Coffee Museum in the back of the dining room. It's Cool.!"
86,76,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,12/20/2020,"I definitely enjoy caffe Vittoria for the ambiance and location. I prefer other local spots drinks and desserts more, however sometimes you just want a cute spot to sit after dinner and have an espresso and treat. When that feeling hits me, this is my go to spot. The service is fine - unremarkable. The prices are a little high for what you get, but that's probably due to the high rent on the location. Overall, it's definitely worth a stop - I'll leave it up to you if you work it in to your normal rotation."
87,77,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/15/2021,Still the best place for cappuccino or Espresso martinis ... or both.. we opted for both!
88,78,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,12/31/2020,"Must come!! Delicious hot chocolate. Cappuccino, Canolis, and chocolate martini. Every time I come to Boston I have to pass by here. Love the antique look of the place and the service is great too."
89,79,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,1/2/2022,"Best cappuccinos ever!  They were short staffed, so you do need to wait a little, but well worth it. Highly recommend! Servers were very kind."
90,80,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,5/3/2021,"BEWARE! None of the desserts are made in house. This place is a giant tourist trap. I sat and watched as they got a delivery of numerous boxes of Costco pre-made cakes and pastries. I also saw tons of frozen strawberry topping and nesquick. I did a quick google search and saw they won ""best  hot chocolate in Boston""... You all must really like nestle nesquick haha!! You have been warned"
91,81,Caffé Vittoria,3 star rating,2/14/2022,"We have been here probably 5 times over the years and here are my thoughts. So the 3 stars are for the desserts, everything else here I can do without. The desserts are undeniably the best part of this place. The downside, hectic, extremely noisy, and the tables are on top of each other. When you come here on Friday and Saturday nights it is not well organized when seating people at tables. There are 2 entrances and they allow people to enter in both. We walked in and were taken to a table by the hostess only to find that someone else seated people there or they walked in the other entrance and sat themselves. Service is hit or miss at best, never what I would consider good or great. Along with the service issues I have never met a friendly waitress. No smiles or exchanging pleasantries here. The drinks to me seem to be on the small side and weak. I have never had  coffee drink that I could taste a hint of alcohol. On top of all that it's cash only. If you want a better experience go in the afternoon or week days, avoid the weekend nights or take the desserts to go."
92,82,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,8/13/2021,"Good every time I come here.  I got tiramisu, and it was a little frozen but I understand that they are busy and probably have to cook in large batches and freeze.  Eclair and rum baba were good as well.  It was very busy so service was kind of slow, but again I understand that.  Highly recommend!"
93,83,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,3/25/2019,"There's something magical about a perfectly made cappuccino. The dusting of cocoa as you take a giant sip and the fluffy foam followed by a strong caffeinated river going down. 

This is the place for a pre dinner capp. Everyone comes to the North End for old school Italian grub. It's an absolute madhouse. You have to be prepared to wait. I would recommend having an espresso beverage before the dinner. While we were there the dinner crowd came stampeding in. 

So happy we got a table towards the front. Perfect for people watching and enjoying the cafe atmosphere. I wish we would have had room for dessert. The cannolis and the tiramisu looked mouth watering. 

I don't know what happened to modern day cafes but the legit old school Italian joint are unbeatable."
94,84,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,5/10/2021,"If you really want to die, go to Caffe vittotia. We found mold in our dessert! Mold!! How long was it there for? We don't know but our experience was so unpleasant that it almost made me vomit. The waitress offered an apology and she was ok. It was not her fault. However, the manager's attitude was like 'meh.. this happens frequently' ... he got this off the bill and we still paid for the other desserts and drinks we had. Are you kidding? We will avoid this place like the plague. What a disgrace."
95,85,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,11/30/2020,"Cafe Vittoria is a consummate Italian cafe with decorations spanning decades. The staff are very helpful and friendly, and the food is absolutely amazing!"
96,86,Caffé Vittoria,4 star rating,1/22/2020,"BC I'm basic and follow Thrillist like the bible, I succumbed to their recommendation to visit Cafe Vittoria. They describe the front door as almost a teleport, transporting visitors to a cafe in Italy itself. Well, I like to travel. I hope customs isn't strict bc my passport is currently in the possession of the USPS for renewal. 

There is a slight culture shock inside the place. The decor is unusual and quirky. We took a seat at one of their little cafe tables near a nook which has a mural of some Italian scene on it. I didn't inspect it because I was facing the other way and there were tables against the wall so that felt awkward to me. 

The menu has a ton of cafe beverages, as you probably expected. I, again being basic, ordered a cappuccino. The gelato case near the entrance put the idea of ice cream in my head and I conveniently remembered that it's been AGES since I've had sorbet. We went with mango. Finally, my GF brought their pastries to my attention. Lobster tail caught my attention. What the fuck is that doing on a pastry menu? I then received an education and for the sake of completion, had to try it of course. 

The waitresses were a bit bitchy, NGL. I took one for the team and ordered everything so my little lobster tail only ordered a glass of water which classically never came. 

The cappuccino was incredible. One of the best I've had in a long time. It was incredibly creamy and rich with a hint of chocolate (unless I'm hallucinating). The sorbet was very sweet but smooth and DELICIOUS. The lobster tail crust was flaky and crunchy. The cream inside was thick without being too heavy with a touch of sweetness. I couldn't decide whether I wanted to eat the dough or the cream more. I kept becoming overwhelmed with the richness of the pastry and halting my consumption but I kept coming back for more. It was actually so intense that I had planned all week to go to Magnolia later for one of their infamous banana puddings but literally had zero desire for any further dessert for the rest of the day. 

This is a GEM. Every trip to Boston requires a visit to this place and the espresso beverages are a must."
97,87,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,5/27/2019,"Boy do I wish this place existed for me back home. I absolutely LOVED the ambiance and setting of this cozy cafe. The space is small, intimate, and bustling with happy diners enjoying amazing pastries and coffees. You must try the cannoli - it is to die for. Best I've ever had! 

The spot is cash only, so be prepared!"
98,88,Caffé Vittoria,1 star rating,12/28/2019,"So I came here to just a slice of teramisu to go. First off, the customer service was a little rude. We were standing by the bar to order, and no one was paying attention to take our order. When a waitress finally asked what we wanted, she told one of the kids behind the bar to give it to us and take our payment. This kid wasn't even paying attention with his iPod buds in his ear. I waved him down at the counter and asked him what the cost was. 

He gave me the wrong change so I asked him what the cost was again showing the change, and he just stared as if I was crazy. After going back and forth multiple times, I ended up just letting it go. 

The teramisu wasn't very impressive either. Never coming back here again.

Don't think it's worth coming here."
99,89,Caffé Vittoria,5 star rating,7/3/2021,This place is as Italian as it gets! Authentic cappuccinos/lattes and pastries. Nice touch with adding cocoa powder to the top of the cappuccino. Fantastic.
100,0,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,11/24/2021,"Really good spot on Hanover street. 
This wasn't the first place I wanted to try when I moved to the neighborhood. I think this was because the sign kinda looks like a Mexican place and then it's Italian so my brain was a little confused. 
Well... it was delicious. My bolognese was so good and we got a nice bottle of red to split as well. Our waitress was so nice and the place is adorable on the inside. 
Awesome spot for a low key Italian dinner in the north end!"
101,1,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,2/27/2022,"Tried Cantina Italiana for dinner a few weeks ago and was excited by the reviews! The service was decent, just wanted to give a shout out to the waiters that refilled our waters, they were really on top of it and I don't think my cup ever went empty. 

We got the Nutella martini, the bolognese and the salmon pasta dish. For the Nutella martini it was interesting but I feel like the alcohol in it was a bit overwhelming and the cocktail was a bit messy in that it was dripping on the side of the cup and my hands got really sticky. 

As for the pasta dishes the salmon was well cooked and the pasta noodles were also well cooked. However the sauces were very subpar, the bolognese didn't really have that meaty flavor that I was hoping for.

Overall the experience was decent but I'm not sure that the food taste and quality measured up to the price we paid."
102,2,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,2/4/2022,"I wasn't blown away by this place but it's nice in the inside, has a nice bar area and my food was good enough to be a 4. My issue was the service was terrible. I'll admit I was in for an early dinner, like 4PM, and they all seemed distracted by setting up for the dinner rush than paying any attention to the couple early customers they had already, including me. Not sure the issue but every step was slow, getting me a menu, getting me a drink, ordering, my food coming out, refilling my drink and getting my check when I was done. Everything was slow it was like I was invisible. At one point I just wanted another drink and I literally couldn't even get the bartender to glance at me for 10 minutes. 

The food, albeit a long wait, was solid. Nothing spectacular and plenty better in the North End but good. I especially liked the pasta fagioli soup I got before my meal. Again, had I gotten a little attention in the service I probably would give it a 4. Maybe just an off night as far as that goes? Unsure."
103,3,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,11/16/2021,"Scored a 6pm reservation for 4 for a celebratory dinner. When we arrived we were quickly seated at a small booth. Luckily we were able to move to a slightly more spacious table towards the back, though be prepared to be in close quarters with other parties. They really want it to feel like you're eating at grandma'a house here, so try to get comfortable. 

We started with a few spritz cocktails and the calamari and the prosciutto mozzarella appetizers. The drinks were tasty and not too strong. The calamari was a verrry small portion for the cost, but pretty tasty. The prosciutto and mozzarella was pretty basic. Just exactly as described. The waiter was frequently asking if we were ready to order entrees, so we appeased him and did.

For mains, we all ended up with bombolotti dishes. Mine included the lobster tail, shrimp and tomato sauce. Pretty tasty, though not very spicy as he warned. The shells were on both the shrimp and lobster. The pasta shape is a fun treat, but overall the portions weren't big enough to satisfying the hungry men in my party. 

Overall not a very classy celebration I hoped for, felt rushed by the waiter, but was fun to try a historic pasta dish in the North End."
104,4,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,9/23/2021,"We popped in here for a drink and an appetizer. 
If you're looking for an amazing bruschetta and a refreshing cocktail, this is the spot. 

I loved their outside dining, but we sat in the bar for a cool down. 

I'm so glad we picked this spot."
105,5,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,12/13/2021,"This was a great place to go on a Saturday night for some great italian food. I loved this place! The service was great and the pasta was very authentic. I also got an espresso martini and that was perfect. You have to make a reservation or else you are not going to get a seat. I made one about two weeks prior so I definitely recommend getting in your reservation ASAP!
Ambiance is great and it was fun to be in the North End."
106,6,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,6/4/2021,"We specifically chose this restaurant due to its long standing history in the North End and are happy we did.  We landed here 2/3rds into our Freedom Trail walk.  It was early afternoon on a weekday so not too busy and we were probably all tourists!  We were seated immediately and brought water (score).  It is hard to explain, but bringing me water right away always sets a positive tone to my dining experience... might also have been that we had been walking for a couple hours and I was thirsty!

We ordered some Calamari, a Caesar salad and a couple of dishes -- the Cioppino and Gnocchi al Forno (with shrimp).  SO delicious... ALL of it.  I absolutely loved the Caesar Salad -- when done right and with homemade dressing that is not too heavy it is perfection and they nailed it.  We had the Tiramisu for dessert and that too was fantastic."
107,7,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,11/8/2021,"Fantastic  food wine and service in a building that hasn't been remodeled in decades. Remember your here for the food, not the ambiance - everything came out fresh and delicious! Our server Omar was a pro and handled everything with ease!"
108,8,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,3/5/2021,"Food was average or slightly above among north end restaurants.  We added $7 or so for half portion of the truffle gnocchi, which turned out to be the best (both taste and value). 

What was concerning was the practice during the pandemic.  MA and Boston requires 25% maximum capacity and 90min limited dining time. Cantina is for sure not enforcing either."
109,9,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,1/31/2021,"Dined here last night. Fatima helped us--she's very nice and provide great recommendations.

Cantina Italians is advertised to be the oldest restaurant in the North End--we'll take it. Worth trying considering the ease of reservation and decent reviews on Yelp, as well as on other platforms. 

Food was delicious. See pictures. 

As for pandemic handling (12/30/2021) - One concern we have is whether the restaurant actually comply with the 25% max capacity. We were one of the first guests, but when we were done, almost every table was occupied. It did not look like 25% max capacity to us. They might've overbooked or did not turn newer customers away when arrived.  Place was, I must say, really crowded. Menu should be switched to 1-time used paper menu rather than reusable plastic menus. Plus side, there's hand sanitizer on every table."

111,11,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,11/1/2020,"After living out of state for the last two years I was really excited to return and enjoy a meal in the North End. The experience is a little different now due to the increased outdoor seating on the already crowded streets, but generally the good food and old-fashioned italian vibes are still there. I enjoyed my meal at Cantina Italiana aside from a few small hiccups, including a large party of loud birthday-celebrators (which was not the restaurant's fault but stricter limitations on group size/noise level would be appreciated). In general I was a little surprised at how close together the tables were inside the restaurant, given the current social distancing guidance.

Not every pasta dish on their menu contains pasta handmade on site (understandable given their size), so I specifically tried the Bombolotti Alla Buongustaia because it was described as their signature house-made pasta with handmade sausage. All the flavors together were SO tasty and that house-made bombolotti was in fact bomb. Definitely would get this again!

I also tried the Scialatelle with Salmon, also described on the menu as house-made. The pasta itself was good, but unfortunately the sauce was lackluster. It was salvaged by adding salt to bring out the mild flavor that was there, but really could have used some more robust seasoning."
112,12,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,1/4/2022,"We had a great experience at dinner tonight with our server Omar! He was fun and very polite! We have came here several times and he always is very nice and personable with us, even when it is very busy! We would definitely come back here again. The food is amazing as well as the service!"
113,13,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,4/11/2021,"This is not the place to be if you're looking to get martinis. Started with a cosmopolitan that came out sweet and nothing like what it's supposed to taste like. Espresso martini was on the lighter side with almost no espresso just a lot of baileys. 
They need a better system put in place for hectic weekend nights. I watched our appetizers be brought to multiple tables before getting to us. 
The truffle fries & prosciutto and mozz were the only things I would recommend getting. 
As plates were being brought out, the cacio e Pepe looked yummy but actually was the opposite. Noodles were too hard and the plate was warm so the cheese was getting sticky. Little to no taste, would not recommend."
114,14,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,10/24/2021,They made me a custom spaghetti and clam sauce a mix between red and white. It was so good better then I expected i would highly recommend it. my waiter Manny was excellent
115,15,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,9/6/2021,"This review is about the very messed up person who takes reservations and seats you, we didn't even make it  inside the restaurant because of her aggression towards us. We didn't feel safe going in because she was physically aggressive. If you catch her on a bad day she might end up ruining your evening so bear that in mind while making a reservation at this place. There are multiple reviews calling her out and I've never been treated this horribly anywhere so am gonna take the good money I was about to drop here, to so many other incredible places in the area.

We went there on a super busy night were walking to the check in counter outside the restaurant on the pavement when I saw a crazy lady yelling at the long line of customers waiting patiently and adhering to social distancing. *she did not have a mask on and was yelling so much her  spittle was flying at people*. She was unraveling and clearly needed to be sat down and taken care of or given a break to collect herself as she was abusing everyone at the restaurant and creating a huge scene outside ruining the experience of the people who had gotten in and were looking for a nice evening. 

We walked up to get to check in and instead of explaining the next steps and where to wait she started yelling at us without understanding that we were just looking to her guidance. I am still shaking and can't make sense of anything that happened. We just walked off after she started spitting at us because my family's health is paramount and no meal is worth contracting covid."

PS - ambiance is homey but loud"
117,17,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,3/20/2022,"So far the worst place we have been to in the North End. We had a reservation, but there was no table for us (~30min wait outside). The worst, however, was the food: the least authentic pasta carbonara with cream (why?!) and almost no bacon for the amount of pasta, and the cacio e peppe was basically just plain pasta with a few ungrounded pepper corns. But that was not all. The wine (Barbera) was undrinkable and the prosecco was completely flat like a white wine. How on Earth can this place survive?! There are so many gems out there in the North End (Carmelina's, Giacomo's, Neptune, ...), just don't waste your time or money here..."
118,18,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,12/27/2021,We dined at Cantina Italianna on Christmas Day. I ordered Saltimbiccq Chicken - pan seared chicken and sautéed with foraged mushrooms in a marsala wine sauce topped with Prosciutto di Parma and mozzarella. The dish was great. Bigger portion compared to those served in New York.
119,19,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,11/27/2021,"We had a reservation, they told us that reservations are first come first serve. Sorry what is the point of a reservation? This place is a fucking scam why do you have reservations if they're not reserved for people who actually made them. Host staff is just as useless and unaccomdating. We were one minute late after getting a text that said our table was ready and by the time we got there they already gave our table away. Their  host was laughing at us. I hope you all choke on your meatballs."
120,20,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,11/27/2021,I would give them 0 stars if I could. We had a reservation at 7:30 and we got to the hostess stand and the hostess said our reservations don't necessarily mean that you will be seated at that time and that we would have to show up within ten minutes once we were notified that our table was ready... we waited patiently for the table and were texted that our table was ready and when we walked over within 30 seconds... they gave away our table. This restaurant has the most unprofessional hostess who also chose to laugh at the situation when we were waiting in below freezing temperatures for over 30 minutes.
121,21,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,6/17/2021,"I literally have never been as disappointed as this meal.   The location was recommended by locals, and even our hotel.  
Each sauce tasted the exact same (alla vodka / spaghetti sauce) and the noddles were over cooked and mushy.  
We hoped for fresh hot bread at the table, and that was not the case.  
It was the ONLY meal during our five days in Boston that we regretted.  It still upsets me that we spent $145 for a family of four on what we hoped would have been our favorite meal."

No, but it was incredibly delicious and everyone was happy. We had the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer, lasagna, fettuccine carbonara, vodka sauce and spaghetti in my group. Generous portion sizes! The service was excellent too. They were out of bread but then told us they called local bakeries to see what they could find for us. It just showed they cared.

This is only my second review, so bear with me...  No reservations and while second in  line, we witnessed a bitter, old hostess/owner berating a server and then complaining about her to the first in line customers.  We were told 10-15 minutes for a table.  After 30 minutes of people watching (the location IS great) and hearing the hostess saying there was no wait, I asked and we were immediately seated. My first WETF.  The berating continued...  Imagine eating at a ""quaint Italian restaurant and hearing yelling from the hostess, ""YOU GOTTA KEEP THE AC ON!  YOU GOTTA KEEP THE AIR FLOWING!  Or ""WE GOT A PARTY OF 13 COMING IN!  DO THIS AND THIS AND THAT!""  My second WTF.

I was embarrassed for myself.  Why didn't I speak up?  ""STOP OPENLY CRITISIZING YOUR STAFF TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!  WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENJOY A NIGHT OUT!  And/or ""COULD YOU KEEP IT DOWN WHILE WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENJOY A MEAL OUT?"" 

The food?  Poor at best.  Maybe it was what we ordered.  The $35 veal was dry and tasteless, the pasta was overcooked and miniscule (isn't pasta cheap?) and the sauce tasted burnt.  My ultimate WFT.

Other than our server, EVERYTHING SUCKED!!!"

130,30,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,11/3/2021,My wife and I got lucky when we chose this restaurant! This is a true North End gem. The restaurant is very authentic and the food and wine were excellent. If you are ever in Boston make sure that you go there for a nice dinner!
131,31,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,9/19/2021,"Service was delayed but food was solid! Waited 30mjn past our reservation to be seated and 35 minutes after ordering for food (nothing too crazy on a Saturday night). Mariana our server was friendly. Hostess definitely was not, but she was able to manage the large amount of folks waiting for their tables so it was effective. For the price and atmosphere, maybe I'd try somewhere else when I return to the North End, but being able to make a reservation was a plus."
132,32,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,12/8/2019,"The North End is filled with its hits and misses, sprinkled in between the classics like Mike's Pastry and Vittoria Cafe, but Cantina is a total home run in my carb-loving book of Best Italian Eats. I came here for my birthday dinner and it's like being transported to old Italy -- you walk into the sounds of Italian being spoken, smell the comforting zing of tomato sauce, and imagine someone's nonna cooking up a homemade pasta dish for you. There's a certain charm to the whole place that I haven't really found replicated in any other restaurant in Little Italy. 

Maybe it's the booths -- being seated in one puts you in a little world of your own, where despite it being super busy / a packed house, you feel like you can have an intimate conversation with your table, and savor over all the dishes you ordered together, sharing pieces of your dish with your friends and family, just like you'd imagine a homey Italian dinner.

We were on a time crunch with tickets to a show, but somehow our (amazingly efficient / sweet) waiter was able to work with the kitchen to get our dishes out quickly and impeccably cooked. 

I had the Bombolotti alla Buongustaia (Bombolotti pasta, spicy Italian sausage, fresh basil, marinara sauce, parmigiano), while we shared a few apps I can barely recall since we devoured them so quickly. I had never had bombolotti, but this was hands down my favorite of everything we ordered. The pasta was cooked SO perfectly, and that sauce! Suffice to say, I'll never train for a sprint or a marathon, but I can proudly say I can devour a multi-course Italian meal in under 45 minutes. Which should be record-holding, in some country, I'm sure. 

It's generally impossible to get my niece to a) eat her dinner or b) talk to any strangers, and she literally left hi-fiving the waiter and saying how amazing the spaghetti was, so home run it is:)."
133,33,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,9/26/2021,It won't let me leave a 1/2 star but these people SUCK SUCK SUCK Had us wait 40 minutes for a table then after an hour of waiting for our food they came to us to say they lost the ticket and no one made our food. AND they wouldn't rush it so it would be another 30-40 minutes and suggested we go eat somewhere else!! I literally hate you people.
134,34,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,8/29/2021,"Not a great experience. For starters, none of the waitstaff nor the hostess were wearing masks. They didn't even acknowledge it when we all had ours on. The Covid test positivity rate is 6.4% in the North End right now...
Beyond our fears that we were contracting Covid, we were disappointed in the service and the food. The drinks came quickly enough, but we waited a full hour for our food. The pasta fagioli soup had nearly any flavor. We never got the parm cheese we requested. The spaghetti and meatballs were very average and the spaghetti was slightly hard. The worst part, however, was the gnocchi. It was undercooked and the insides were powdery and dry. We were definitely disappointed overall, and the bill was huge and felt entirely not worth the $. Sad because it was our last big night out in the North End and we wished we had gone back to Monica! Next time..."
135,35,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,11/25/2021,I haven't been there since I left Massachusetts the food it was delicious the service was fantastic the place brought back so many memories.
136,36,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,12/27/2021,"For being an Italian restaurant in the North End this was just ok. I ordered penne arrabbiata, the sauce itself had fine taste but it was not spicy at all and there were slices of jalapeño peppers in the dish. I love jalapeños but the menu said nothing about them and they're not traditionally in an arrabbiata sauce. I'm giving our waitress the benefit of the doubt and assuming based on service she was very new. She only listed 1 special while the table behind us heard 4 specials from their waiter, she told us there was no more soup and we watched multiple tables (who were seated after us) get delivered the same soup we asked for...maybe it was just an off night for them. If you're looking for an old school Italian feel this restaurant definitely has that vibe."
137,37,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,12/17/2021,"Originally, they were accommodating and took us 20 minutes late from our reservation. The food was great and we had a great time. As we were finishing our drinks, we were told we needed to hurry up and were rushed out of the restaurant. Did not appreciate the lack of accommodation to us finishing up our drinks and dinner."
138,38,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,10/16/2021,"Quite the crowd outside waiting for a table at 7 pm  Dined here last night while vacationing in Boston.  As good as any place in little italy in NY.  Very good apps, pasta and veal entrees and attentive service."
139,39,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,10/26/2021,One of the best Italian restaurants we ate at on our recent trip to Boston. Delicious food and their fresh soft pasta is always a plus.  The hostess was hilarious and the ambience was relaxed yet refined. Cannot wait to return to get more pasta
140,40,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,7/18/2021,We went here for my wife's Birthday and while the food was great the overall experience was not great.  The woman working at the outdoor desk told me check in for the reservation was at the bar which it was not it ended up being at the outdoor desk. The same lady came up to me when I was going back to the check in and grabbed me very inappropriately. I asked for a manager and the worker I asked introduced me to Omar as a manager.  Omar was very apologetic but the lady seemed to not care at all. When we finally checked in for our reservation the workers out there were apologetic. My point is if you are going to spend $$$ on a nice night out don't roll the dice on possibly getting a lady who is going to be rude with unwelcome touching.  It's sad because for special dinners this was our place for the past 6 years and now it's not.
141,41,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,7/31/2021,Do not order from this restaurant on any food courier app. The food was absolutely appalling. I never knew salmon could have a rubbery texture until I ordered from here today. The food was not packaged correctly therefore it did not taste fresh nor did it look appetizing. I ended up trashing $80 worth of food. Don't waste your money.
142,42,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,7/12/2020,"It feels great to be back in the North End!  Came here for a Friday night meal with some friends and we loved it.  Come while the weather is great and grab a seat outside.  

I was with a group of three, and we started with the Polpette meatballs and they were fantastic.  Conveniently they came with three, one for each of us in the party.  The food comes out quickly and hot.  For my main dish, I ordered the Cacio E Pepe and it was fantastic.  I'm a bit biased because this is my favorite pasta dish, but WOW!  Not only were they heavy on the cheese, the dish had whole black peppercorns in it.  I went halfsies on Pappardelle Bolognese with my friend, and again, that was also great.  The pasta was fresh, light, and cooked perfectly al dente.  

Great spot to hit with family or friends.  They have a great cocktail selection (they make a mean espresso martini), and a good assortment of Italian wines.  All the waiters were in masks, and they had hand sanitizers at each table.  Overall great experience, can't wait to go again."
143,43,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,11/27/2021,hostess was horrible. Reservation didn't mean anything. laughed in our faces as we waited patiently
144,44,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,7/17/2021,"Excellent experience at Cantina , loved the food and Maria our server was over the top awesome, would highly recommended."
145,45,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,7/11/2021,"Seats were all broken, one cheek on concrete, one cheek in an abyss of loose, ripped leather. Watered down drinks, as in you order drinks and receive water. Pathetic risotto, and oil drenched spinach. Salmon was crispy and good, but that's only if you're willing to wait an hour for food. Disappointment of a lifetime. Would rather eat plane food, which is actually good these days. At least it wasn't too expensive. Don't waste your time."
146,46,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,7/4/2021,Horrible spaghetti and even worse lasagna. It was the worst  Italian food I've ever had.  Long wait as well.  I sent back the lasagna to the kitchen. There are better options for Italian. Avoid!
147,47,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,6/14/2020,"So excited to dine in the North End again! Props to Cantina Italiana for serving their full menu, both food and drink, despite the reduction in tables from the pandemic. The outdoor seating is a little closer than other places I've seen due to limited real estate on Hanover Street, but I felt and that everyone out was keeping respectable distances.

The staff was fantastic, our waiter was very attentive and gave great recommendations. They gave us fresh bread and oil for the table. I ordered a Harry's Bellini to drink and the Bombolotti alla Buongustaia pasta dish for my lunch. I would recommend both, I was completely satisfied with my meal. The pasta is a heavy dish that came out in a sizzling hot pan with layers of gooey goat cheese and spicy sausage baked in. I'll definitely be back!"
148,48,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,10/2/2019,"Delicious food but unfortunately also an extremely long wait to get said food!

I came with two friends on a Sunday night and we were seated immediately, but our food took more than 30 minutes to be served. Perhaps this was exacerbated by the fact that we sat right next to where the food comes out of the kitchen so we were disappointed many times as servers came out with food but it wasn't ours.

In addition, my friend somehow got a half order instead of a full order. The bad news is that as a result the full order took an additional 10 minutes to come out (the other two of us were almost done with our food by the time his full order came out). The good news is that the waitress was able to get him an extra large order as compensation.

I had the shrimp scampi and would definitely recommend it to anyone who comes here. The noodles are well cooked and the sauce is well flavored -- not too salty or oily but still flavorful.

Besides food taking a long time to be served, service was good. We had complimentary bread and our waters were refilled promptly throughout the meal.

I would give this place another try but only if I have a lot of time to spare and good company to come with."
149,49,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,6/4/2021,"Don't go here. Super unsanitary, lipstick stain on the glass. Told our waitress and she said it's happened 6x this week!! Food is mediocre at best, I can make it better myself and I'm not even Italian. Don't go here."
150,50,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,7/8/2020,"This was one of the few restaurants that was not packed in North End on a weekend night! For that I am grateful, the pasta was good although the service could be better. We were seated in a place that was hard to see, so it wasn't too big of a deal. The flavors weren't too strong, but I didn't mind and overall I would come again!"
151,51,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,8/25/2021,"Good solid offering in the North End.  We were a group of 4.  We arrived around 5pm on a Tuesday.  We were able to get an outdoor table.  

In general, service was good, other than not clearing away the appetizer plates before the main course arrived, which made us do some gymnastics with plates.  Otherwise, we were provided bread, water glasses were regularly filed, drinks/refills from the bar arrived on-time.  The waitress checked on us often as expected and meals/courses arrived hot.

Food was very good.  Portions were appropriate.  Nobody in our group left unhappy or hungry.  

I would certainly return.  Nothing significant to complain about.  Perfect, no, but very good yes."
152,52,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,10/17/2021,"I couldn't decide whether to give this place 2 or 3 stars. We had an 8:30 reservation on a Saturday night. After telling the hostess we had a reservation, she pointed at a line to stand on. After about 20 minutes, we asked how long the line will take. The same hostess said there were no lines and we had to check in, after pointing us to a line and not asking to check us in before. Later on, without any provocation, she tells me I am acting rude and that will not help her get us a table any sooner. It's good to note at this point there were 2 girls who had been sitting with their check waiting for someone to collect their cards for about 30 minutes. Right in front of the hostess's face. Anyway, after another few minutes on line, the hostess came up to me and started telling me it's not her fault the restaurant is packed and then she grabbed both my cheeks and pinched them. (Covid?) Again, whatever, just trying to get inside and enjoy some food. 
We finally got seated in the way back of the restaurant right next to the kitchen. The kitchen door slammed loudly about every 45 seconds. It took forever to get our wine and the prosciutto and mozz was nothing special. My main course of steak had a sauce that tasted exactly like this chicken sauce I make that I found online. It's a good thing it's a delicious sauce! Our dessert drink, a Nutella martini, was delicious. The pasta dishes were creative shapes and cooked perfectly, but the vodka sauce was nothing special. Throughout the meal, the hostess who I imagine is also the manager, would walk throughout the restaurant rearranging tables. When talking to a server she dropped a very loud F bomb while yelling at him. When they would rearrange tables, they paid no mind to the patrons sitting around, bumping into them with the chairs they were moving. Our waitress was very sweet though. On second thought, i don't know why I even thought of 3 stars. Definitely 2 stars. Terrible service and atmosphere, but the food was pretty good."
153,53,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,12/29/2021,My experience was terrible. My water glass looked as if someone's lip prints were on it. The service was terrible. I'm still waiting for the bread to be brought to my table. Part of the ceiling looked as if it was going to fall. My chicken dish had a ton of oregano. It is definitely off my list.
154,54,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,12/27/2021,Amazing food and drinks but the service was super slow - still will go back though!!! Highly recommend anything with truffle or their house made pasta!! Loved the espresso martinis!!
155,55,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,3/31/2021,"We are so glad to have happened upon this spot for dinner with our family of four. They were incredibly accommodating and welcomed us (even with two young children) warmly. Not only was the service attentive, the food was excellent. Even a simple pasta with marinara for our children was wonderfully seasoned and you could tell the sauce had been cooked down for hours. The salmon was a hit with the entire family and our starters of broccoli and mushrooms were some of the best we have had. We highly recommend. It made our North End evening (and it's right down the street from Mike's, which was a score)!"
156,56,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,3/28/2020,"Excellent dinner all around beginning with the service.

Everyone's meals ranged from very good to terrific. I got the terrific one!  Mine was fusili boscaila (pardon the spelling) - pasta with sausage and greens. The overall dish came together in a fine combination of flavor.

This restaurant features a healthy wine list ranging from about $35 a bottle to $150. Dinner ranged form about $20-$35 but mostly in the low 20s. 

Did I mention the large dessert drink selection? Love it.

I would absolutely come back!"
157,57,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,10/17/2021,We had reservations for 8:30 didn't get sat until around 9:20. Would not recommend for someone who would find this irritating or inconvenient.
158,58,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,3/28/2021,"Worst experience I've ever had in the North End. Don't bother making a reservation because they won't honor it.

We had a reservation for 8 pm and had to wait outside because of Covid rules (not a problem). The hostess was rude and unprofessional and was taking people based on how big their party was - saying they could seat a party of 6 that just showed up because that was the table size they had available (we were a party of 2). She wasn't using any of the party names and it was visibly confusing to everyone waiting outside. It made no sense and was basically first come first serve. So we were sat around 8:45 pm.

The reason we came here is because the website showed they were serving the Dine Out Boston menu even on Saturdays. Our waitress said they weren't, and when I told her they had been advertising it she said she ""didn't really know"". 

Their Covid procedures are also spotty. We were in a corner RIGHT next to a party at the bar. Capacity limits have been lifted in Massachusetts but tables are still supposed to be six feet apart. Most here weren't. They also let us order drinks and leave without ordering food (which we were happy about because we didn't want to order off the regular menu) but that's also illegal.

There are plenty of places in the North End you can get friendly service and great food - so don't bother with here."
159,59,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,3/20/2021,"Worst experience I've had at a restaurant in the North End. 

Overall, the staff seemed quite nice, but the managers were not, and the restaurant itself seemed incredibly poorly run. With all the great options in the North End; I'd say to avoid this one at all costs.

I planned on coming here for Dineout Boston. My girlfriend checked ahead that they had their Dineout Boston menu available for Saturday's, and the website confirmed they did. So, I booked a reservation for 6:15. We got there for 6:10 with a conglomerate of people standing outside waiting. I thought, ""Oh, good thing I made a reservation before had."" But, when I went to check in with the manager, she told me, rather rudely, to step aside and step-down as she wanted to get a group of people in after essentially scolding me for nothing. She apologized, then went inside. The kind woman at the front desk then checked me in. 

We had to wait until 6:45 before FINALLY getting the 6:15 table I reserved. As soon as we were seated, we told the waitress we wanted the Dineout Boston menu. She then had to walk over to the same manager from earlier, and we heard the manager say they weren't doing that menu tonight. We then discussed with a separate manager how the website specially says the Dineout Boston is listed as a option today; only to be told tough luck. So, we left. 

We have a sneaking suspicion that they purposely overbook people and had that Dineout menu listed even though it wasn't available, just to get people in the door and force a Sunk Cost fallacy on them to stay and order far more expensive food."
160,60,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/19/2021,"I booked a business dinner for 16 out of towners.   I have heard nothing but raves about the experience and the food.    The staff is very attentive and every detail was taken care of.   This was the perfect ""North End Experience"" without a crazy, over the top price.  

Thank you!"
161,61,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/17/2021,The service was amazing and very quick! The food came in large portion sizes and were very flavorful. Highly recommend the pasta dishes along with the calamari! There are both indoor (with open windows) and outdoor seating.
162,62,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/17/2021,"Delicious food! Our waitress was lovely but a little slow with service but the food was outstanding! We started with peach bellinis, cosmos and the bruschetta. Both cocktails were amazing and the bruschetta was some of the best i've ever had. Each piece had individual balls of mozzarella and the tomatoes were marinated in a touch of balsamic and olive oil. I ordered a dish with pesto, burrata and pine nuts served in a pan. It was delicious!! My friends ordered the carbonara and chicken parm. Both equally delicious and the carbonara was my favorite! We will be returning, hopefully soon!"
163,63,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,10/12/2021,Well what can I say. You would think that I. Little Italy in Boston you could get good food. Not at this place. Service was good but my bolognese had absolutely no flavor.  I make a better sauce by far. My husbands scampi was bland also.
164,64,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,9/12/2021,"I rarely write reviews unless something is outstanding.  This was such a bad embarrassing experience that I am making an exception.

We were visiting Boston and wanted an authentic Italian dinner in the North End.  The hotel concierge made reservations.  We had guests - Close family friends who've been in Boston for 2 years for law school with a 7 month old.  Three of us got out of the car to let them know we were there for our reservation and let us know where my husband could park the car - as we didn't know there was no parking - we are from out of state. When we walked up the Hostess was screaming at two waitresses - belittling them in front of all the restaurant guests who were sitting outside.  After a few moments we asked her where to park and she chewed our heads off.  We said here for our reservation and she yelled at my guests for standing on the sidewalk being in the way of her waiter.  If the restaurants around us hadn't looked over crowded and we hadn't had a 7 month old with us, I would have walked away.  She continued to berate staff throughout the evening and continued her absolute rudeness to us through out.  When our waiter did not come back for almost 30 minutes we asked her to send over our waiter and she screamed that we sent him away.  Which we did by asking him to give us a minute to look at the menu but not 20-30 minutes.  

Once we ordered and the food finally came - all of the dishes were bland and the sauces all tasted like the same dish.  The ""homemade"" pasta noodles were gooey and somewhat stuck together.  And the noise was so loud we could barely hear ourselves talk and had to keep asking the waiter to repeat himself.  The cost for this rude experience and mediocre food was about $180 for four people with no alcohol ordered.  Just 4 pasta dishes, 1 salad, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert. +$24 to park at the Waterfront.  I asked the kids who had been living in Boston - is this an Italian thing, a Boston thing, or is this lady as rude I think.  The answer -  Just her - VERY RUDE HOSTESS; VERY OVERPRICED; VERY MEDIOCRE FOOD. DON""T WASTE YOUR EVENING."
165,65,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,3/28/2021,"Nothing special going on here . They try , service was good , but it's the type of food you get at a pizza joint . Had to pay $25 to park , which is probably what my dinner was worth ( for two people). Had the Pesto ( very dry ), caprisse salad ( mozzarella and tomatoes cut way to thick )and cannoli. Don't believe the hype . They are trying I give them that ."
166,66,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,1/25/2019,"WOW! What an amazing Italian restaurant located in the North End of Boston! We found this place after doing our research on Yelp (of course!), and we are glad we did! I would definitely recommend reservations, as they are pretty busy on most nights. We did have to wait a little bit even though we had a reservation, but it was worth it. 

The host really made us feel like we were in an authentic Italian restaurant. He was very friendly and his accent was everything! We sat in a cute little booth that had coat hangers on the end (a first for me, being from Florida). Our waitress was little flustered, but we didn't take it personally and still enjoyed our meal. 

I enjoyed a glass of wine, while my boyfriend tried their mule and a bourbon spice. He said he wouldn't get the bourbon spice again, but the mule was great. I ordered the gnocchi, and let me tell you it was the best one I have ever had. It was made in house and the sauce was just to die for. My boyfriend got the spaghetti with red sauce, and he said the fresh pasta was perfect. 

We were too full for dessert, but they do have a promising menu. Overall, amazing Italian restaurant with authentic cuisine. You can't go wrong with this place!"
167,67,Cantina Italiana,4 star rating,8/28/2020,"4.5
Very well spaced outdoor dining area (considering the whole situation with COVID-19). The food was phenomenal and the waiter was very attentive. My only issue was with the portion size: the plates were huge which made the actual food look tiny. The gnocchi that I ordered was fantastic but seemed way too little for 26 dollars. Other than that, everything else was amazing, I highly recommend visiting!"
168,68,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,8/22/2020,"I made a reservation in advance for 8:30pm on a Friday night for a special occasion. Upon arrival we were told to wait in line as it was ""First come first serve"", according to the manager. We ended up waiting for half an hour, in the same line with people who didn't make a reservation at all. (I wasn't even asked for my name for verification) 
After waiting in the heat for 30 minutes, the evening was pretty much ruined.
It is very wrong and misleading for a restaurant to make themselves open to reservations, when they do not appreciate them. 
The food was average and the service was remarkably slow. 
I personally had a very disappointing experience here, which had nothing to do with COVID-19.
I would not recommend this place to anyone."

172,72,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,8/25/2021,"Horrible flavor.
I grew up in Italy and generally avoid Italian restaurants in the U.S. because I find that they often do not replicate the authentic flavors I'm used to.
I ordered a salad and a special, Risotto Milanese, a favorite of mine.
The salad was a unceremonious mess of iceberg, thick cucumber medallions, cherry tomatoes, pickled onions, and some creamy dressing.
The risotto took 30 minutes to arrive, although risotto tends to have a prep time of 15-20 minutes. Either they were struggling or inefficient in the kitchen. As soon as the dish arrived, I knew it was a disaster. The butter had split from the mixture to form this pool, failing to stay contained within the emulsion. The rice was both overcooked and undercooked, not al dente at all. There were thick slices of Parmesan on top, which do not help with the flavor balance. The risotto was too pale and lacked the appropriate amount of saffron. The dish ended up tasting bland yet thick and greasy.
Service was great though. I let the servers know I wasn't happy and they took the risotto off my bill and offered to make me another dish. I refused, not wanting to waste any food, but I appreciate how gracious they were about the whole thing."
173,73,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/21/2020,"Absolutely amazing from start to finish!! The waitstaff is so attentive, love the authentic atmosphere, and the food...omg the food!!! The bread was unbelievable on its own, but dipped in the olive oil was even better!!! We had the Arincini  balls as an appetizer. I've never been a big fan of these and now I know why...they weren't made properly!! But Cantina made them so delicious!!! I won't eat them anywhere else ever again!! We had their specialty pasta with sausage and goat cheese. Absolutely awesome and so filling!!! You will NOT leave this place hungry!! We came here on a recommendation and will be back again and again!"
174,74,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,12/27/2020,Food had no flavor probably the worst Italian meal I have ever had. The service was amazing. I would not recommend eating at this establishment.
175,75,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,10/31/2021,Fantastic food and even better service.  We were a party of 11 and got to the restaurant 20 min before opening.  They went ahead and seated us and the service was excellent.  Highly recommend the lasagna!
176,76,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,8/16/2018,"Dined here with 8 colleagues on a Wednesday night during a recent business trip in Boston.  Though noticeably busy, the hostess said she'd seat us ASAP.  After 15 awkward minutes of standing in the narrow entryway, our table was ready.  The dining room walls were plastered with Zagat awards from decades gone by.  I noticed there were none in recent years, then experienced why....

Our server was a nice bald Italian gentleman but was very inefficient.  After sitting unattended for 10 minutes, he came to the table, mentioned restaurant week specials then disappeared for 10 minutes before returning with that menu.  I had a hard time finding anything I was interested in eating, so I went with a salad. 

It took 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive and another 20 minutes for appetizers and bread.  The calamari was sub-par, very greasy and rubbery/tough.  Multiple order errors resulted from him not writing anything down:  2 people ordered the same beer but received 2 different colored brews, still he chose to deliver them.  A salad came out incorrectly and at the wrong time; I chose to just eat so I wouldn't have it reserved to me stale.

Long story short, our entire dining time was over 2.5 hours, not by choice.  Skip this place and try another Italian restaurant in the same 2 block vicinity."
177,77,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,6/27/2021,"Came here for dinner. It was good that we were able to make a last minute reservation. However, the meal did not meet our expectations. The bread wasn't very good.  I expect better from an Italian restaurant. The Arancini was good, but the temperature was inconsistent. The bolognese was good, but the pasta wasn't cooked enough. The gnocchi was possibly the worst I've had in my life. The sauce was good, but something was wrong with the pasta. The service started out good, but as they got busier throughout the evening we ended up waiting over 20 minutes for the check. I found the ladies room to be a little dirty for my liking."
178,78,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/22/2019,"This place is so good! While there were lines elsewhere, I was surprised that there wasn't one for this restaurant. Everything was great.

+Food: Be sure to get a dish that has the HOMEMADE pasta. 
-Arugula Salad: So fresh and a great way to wet your palate. Comes with lots of Parmesan cheese
-Bolognese: Ugh so good. I love these classic flavors. I got some cheese shredded on top. Very hearty. Couldn't finish and had a little bit left to bring home.
-Gnocchi: Honestly, some of the best gnocchi I've ever had. It was so soft and not stale tasting or overpowering in any way. I can't remember a time I've had better gnocchi than this. 

+Service:
Super great. Our server checked in a few times and she was so friendly and helpful. We weren't going all out on our meal."

181,81,Cantina Italiana,3 star rating,12/26/2019,"I normally would give Cantina 41/2 stars, but our recent experience was not all our family has been accustomed to over the years. 

It was Christmas Eve and packed house, so was willing to give them a bit of a break. We made a reservation for 8:30 pm and arrived at 8:15. We were there to celebrate my parents' 48th Anniversary. 

It was disappointing that despite our reservation made earlier in the day, we weren't seated until almost 9:20 pm.  

Luckily the kind waitress/bareback/all star put on the BYU/Hawaii football game! 

Also, two groups of 4 people who walked in after is and did not have reservations were actually seated before us! 

I think it was because of the end of the night, but the food just wasn't up to our usual eats at Cantina. I ordered veal Gino, but was served chicken Gino and told it was veal she. I inquired. I decided to take the high road and eat the chicken! 

We also ordered antipasto that never arrived. 

We will come back and I'll post a new review next time.  Hoping it was just an off-night. I did notice the manager Chuck was off duty and the owner didn't seem to be around either. 

I will say the 2 ladies behind the bar did an excellent job entertaining guests while waiting for their tables. 

It was bad the off night cane during our special family celebration, but my parents still had a good time."

183,83,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,7/1/2018,"We walked in and didn't think ahead about making reservations. We only waited 15 min but we did eat late to be honest. The host was distinguished and nice. 

We were served quickly and shared meatballs and a pasta dish. Bread and olive oil is served before the meal. We enjoyed the gnocchi tremendously. It was perfectly done! Creamy, tender melt in your mouth awesomeness. 

It was a quick bite. We weren't too hungry and needed to save room for desert. I would have loved to have had a large long meal here. Maybe next time...."
184,84,Cantina Italiana,1 star rating,5/14/2019,"I guess we should have known when we called and sought a last minute reservation on a Saturday night and this was the one place that said they had availability that it was unlikely we'd be seated anywhere near our reservation time, but a wait of an hour is really pretty obscene.  And, the host kept assuring us we were ""easy"" or ""close,"" rather than just being honest or answering us when we checked in repeatedly to ask how many parties were ahead of us or how long of a wait we could expect.  In fact, when we called to make the reservation we were specifically told, ""we're running on time and expect to continue doing so, so please be on time.""  

The waiting area is packed as could be and the bar where you could have a sip and wait is so slow and borderline rude.  It took about 20 minutes to get a beer poured, more for a cocktail, and while you wait, no acknowledgement that your order is next or there's a long backup.  

The food itself was fine, but unremarkable, especially when all the other places on Hanover are pretty much fantastic.  Honestly, nothing justifies the awful service.  It's clear that this place dupes diners by making reservations they can't really accommodate.  It's unconscionable and destroyed our evening.  

Cocktails here are overpriced.  A negroni was $13 and it was overly iced and nothing special.  

The antipasto appetizer special of the day which had several burrata, slices of proscuitto, and grilled artichoke, was the highlight of the meal.  No complaints there.  It was solid.  The meatball appetizer which came with three very large tender meatballs was quite tasty.  The arugula salad was boring but okay, topped with slices of parmesan cheese and a few tomatoes.  The bolognese was okay but the noodles were really stuck together and it could have used a little bit more olive oil and a touch more flavor.  Nothing special."
185,85,Cantina Italiana,2 star rating,4/18/2021,Host is extremely rude. They claimed to have outdoor dining on both the website and opentable but when we got to the restaurant it was indoor only and the hostess was extremely rude on the phone and when we were seated.
186,86,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,1/25/2020,"This is the first Yelp review I've ever written, which says a lot about this restaurant. With so many Italian restaurants to choose from in the North End, I am so happy we stumbled upon Cantina Italiana.

We started with the Fried Calamari and antipasti -- both were perfect. For entrees, I had the pesto with homemade pasta and my boyfriend had the Fra Diavolo. To finish, we had the tiramisu which was one of the best desserts I've ever consumed. To top it off, our waitress was lovely and attentive.

I 100% recommend this place to anyone in the area!"
187,87,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/4/2021,Yummmy! Old school Italian that is spot on with food and service. We had barely sat down when the bread basket with nice thick crusty bread. We started with calamari and it was perfect. My husband had lunch he chicken parmigiana plus a side of pasta and I think we could have split it and still had leftovers. My spaghetti and meatballs was awesome. Not a lot of sauce but still delicious. We were tempted by dessert but we were so full we had to pass. I would recommend to anyone.
188,88,Cantina Italiana,5 star rating,8/22/2021,"My wife and I went here with another couple last Thursday night, 19 Aug.  The food was outstanding. My wife ordered the grilled blackened salmon and she was raving about the flavor. Also, the skin was not cut off as my wife prefers the skin for the omega 3's. The other couple both ordered the veal saltimboca and both said it was excellent. I ordered the chicken piccata and it was delicious. We had fried calamari for an appetizer and it was prepared nicely with hot peppers and a marinara sauce and a lemon wedge. 
The ladies both ordered red sangria and they said it was one of the best with not too much ice. I had a vodka martini and my brother in law had the espresso martini. Both were prepared just right. A complimentary dessert of a cannoli, regular tiramisu and a lemon tiramisu ended our meal. This was unexpected and they were delicious.  Our waitress, Maria was very personable and helped us with our menu choices.  Truly a wonderful experience."

We enjoyed screaming out random words at the top of our lungs while the football fans cheered on their team. 

As for the food- delicious. We started with the nachos pulled pork- good- could have used some sour cream and salsa- but still good. 

For my main I had their chicken sandwich and fries- delicious! My niece and her bf also enjoyed their meal. 

Drinks are pricey here- but it's Boston so that's to be expected. 

Loved that they checked our vaccine status (I know that's required here- but as a visitor from North Carolina it was new to me- I wish it was required back home) 

Our waitress was friendly and attentive- would definitely return and recommend."

After being unable to get into a nearby bar that we had tickets for we were pleasantly surprised to find a indoor and outdoor seating along with decent size TVs to watch the game. Shortly after we arrived the place filled to standing room only. We had a booth and after initially having to walk and place our orders at the bar the bartenders were great and very attentive. Despite the place being packed they kept the drinks and food coming directly to our table. The food was your standard bar fare but again the service was great"

My husband got wings and i got a chicken sandwish with fries. The young adults loved the fries. My husband and i really enjoyed the sandwish and bun and dipping sause served on side. Sandwich and fries were served hot a big plus for me. I believe premium beers were $6-$8 for 16 oz. We had a new waitress who seemed very dedicated to getting everythg right. She was being trained by a petite blond who was also very pleasant and experienced. Of course the bar area was very loud but the few side booths and upstairs were much quiter. Bathroom was clean too!"
198,8,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,10/13/2019,"I feel like the restaurant is going through an identity crisis. The WiFi password is ""thebestbbq"", the yelp menu is all about BBQ, but the menu we got today was more sports bar-esque food. If they changed the menu, fine, but a little ""new menu!"" sign would have felt proper.

Service was fine. Our waitress was busy since we came in on a weekend, but she came around every so often. We had to flag her down a couple of times, but had no problem otherwise.

The food experience and price was what made the experience subpar. The kitchen needs to get better at figuring out logistics, because when our food came, my roommate's chicken was steaming hot while my beef was much closer to room temperature.

The fries (with beer cheese and bacon) were delicious and by far my favorite dish of the evening. Was it worth the $10 price tag for fries? Probably not, considering the portions were exactly the same as the side fries that came with my main dish. 

According to my roommate, the southern fried chicken tasted nothing like what you'd expect from ""southern"" fried chicken. It was just fried chicken, with none of the insane crispness that he was used to.

The hanger tips were good, but that's about it. The meat was tender, but somehow not juicy. I personally wouldn't get it again.

Lastly, the draft beer was $7, which is overpriced in my opinion.

All in all, a pretty forgettable place and experience."

Their website let us order (to pay at restaurant) and everything. We scheduled the time for 6PM today and headed over. Upon arriving, we see the restaurant has a sign saying that they're closed until 6/13. What professional establishment would not mention they're closed for a week (6/6-6/13) and not put it anywhere on their website or prevent people from placing online orders? It's a good thing I didn't pay while placing the order because it would have been a giant waste of $200.

Just based on this experience, don't come here and just reading some of the reviews on here, it's not even worth it anyways."

Attempted to order online and the online system did not work so I resorted to calling in my order. One meal in my order was for someone with a serious Gluten allergy. I made it very clear on the phone with specific directions that I needed a Chicken Caesar Salad with NO CROUTONS and GF Caesar dressing on the side. 

Embarrassing to go to this meeting to find that there is are croutons on this salad. This is the type of allergy where a containment like this is health threatening so to say I was disappointed was an understatement. Had to order an additional salad but made sure to get it from a different restaurant as I couldn't risk another mistake like this. 

All other food was good but overall experience was hindered because of this."
204,14,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,9/21/2019,"Meh. Short rib is no good. Burned as hell. Corn bread looks like pond scum surgically relocated to a baking pan and baked. Falls apart before it gets to the table. Salad was basically a vehicle for blue cheese, and overwhelming.

Service tip: When someone (sober) spills a drink, you replace it. Your restaurant is making so much money off of drinks. You can replace it. It was a mistake. Don't give the stink eye.

And you should offer to kill the audio to play a watch party's fight song. We were told ""the guy who does the audio isn't here."" It's not rocket science. Make a call. Figure it out.

Why are you in this business?"

As far as the food

Order a beer if you want a fine enough atmosphere, but leave and go eat somewhere else."

Their ""smoked wings"" are a joke..smoke wings should fall off the bone and theirs....theirs...I can't explain. Not good! Cornbread...HA! Jiffy's taste better, cornbread should be warm and soft, totally opposite for them...cold and hard. Rice and beans...why did I ever order this because I kinda knew what I was setting my self up for. Let me just say...ONE (1) bite and it remained in the bowl/cup.  Absolutely NOOOOOOOOO flavor, not a pinch of salt...nada...zip...zilch! If I had to give something a positive one star it would be the brisket and that's before cutting all the fat off.

And what a beautiful night for this. I looked at the menu outside  and I was super surprised to find out that this was a BBQ joint & bar. The ambiance is dim lights and a few TV is around. In back is a  shuffleboard  and plenty of open Windows to see the people walking it's near the  TD Garden. We was greeted by a friendly Hostess that sat us  down at a table and she had our waitress come over right away. I ordered the brisket combo with mac and cheese and collars and hubby have the steak tip with rice and mac and cheese. I was hoping the mac was decent ,it was ok, bland but you still get that baked feel. The collards ,whoa ,super vinegar alert ! Not my cup of tea . Cornbread a little dry no butter around ,didn't wanna bother our now scarce waitress . The brisket was perfect. No issues there. Hubby had steak tips medium prolly shouldn't have because they were semi-dried out . Could have used gravy with it . Rice and beans were ok just plopped some beans on the yellow rice.  He didn't touch his Mac after I made ""the face"" he calls it . I was full off my brisket,big portions they give you. Music was on point so made my date night a good one here ! I recommend coming here you would enjoy it ! Just don't look for your waitress much after being seated ,lol . Getting the check is fun too !"
214,24,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,9/13/2018,"My boyfriend and I got the Tres Combo to share. We picked the brisket, ribs, and sausage along with chips and potato salad. We figured that, because this was a $30 plate of food, it would be enough for 2 people to share. We were very, very wrong.the cornbread was awful and crumbly (we didn't finish it). There was a small handful of chips which were good but it left only about 5 chips per person. One single sausage to split, 2 ribs, and thin slices of steak that were supposed to be brisket I think? None of it was good and it was VERY overpriced. 

We ordered a couple of IPAs off the drink menu but we were shocked that they were $10 each when we got our bill. We get it, Boston prices suck, especially for alcohol. But our total for one small place of mediocre food, 2 well whiskey and cokes, and 3 beers was $75 (without tip)."

219,29,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/17/2015,"Had the ribs. They were interesting. You could definitely taste the smoke but the texture of the ribs wasn't what you would expect from some slow smoked ribs. It may also be a result of the fact that the ribs were too big and the seasoning doesn't really get into the meat. 

My preference would be to have smaller ribs and to smoke them until they form a good ""bark"" on the outside and the meat will fall off the bone. 

Anyway, I'd go again for a drink. Just not fit the food."

I had a chicken quesadilla and it was just okay---the tortilla wrap was very dry and cracker-crusty. I only ate half of it. Maybe I'll pop in again when I'm attending an event at the Garden....maybe I won't. Some of the other menu items sounded good, but then again, so did the quesadilla. We shall see."

Definitely check it out!"
225,35,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,11/5/2014,"No no no.  Nothing was good about this place.  I work a couple of blocks away and came here with some coworkers for lunch.  Let me list all of the reasons I will never return:

1. Food - this is the most important thing (obviously).  I ordered the spicy sausage with collard greens, fries and a piece of cornbread.  Why these sides?  Because this supposed BBQ place does not serve mashed potatoes or mac and cheese. WHAT?  

- Spicy sausage - the only edible thing on the plate.  I took it out of the too-hard roll.
- Collard greens - ew.  Barely warm and too mushy.  I had 1 bite.
- Fries - tasteless.  How do you mess up fries?  They had no salt.  My coworker next to me bathed her fries in ketchup.  I ate 3.
- Cornbread - hard and dry.  Why is the cornbread at Boston Market better than the cornbread here?  I took 2 bites.
- Drink - diet coke... with no bubbles.  The waitress said it was just their gun.  So why are you serving people sodas when you know it has no bubbles?  I had her take it back and had water.

2. Cleanliness - I opened up my napkin wrap to find a long brown hair.  Since I was with coworkers (and my boss), I didn't make a big deal out of it and just asked for another wrap (about 10 minutes later when the waitress appeared).

3. Service - besides the waitress serving uncarbonated sodas and taking a while to check on us, the thing that annoyed me the most is that she expected us to clear the table for her.  We were seated in a semi-circular booth and my boss was signing the check.  The waitress wordlessly held out her arm for us to give her our plates.  She didn't ask and she didn't wait the 3 minutes for us to leave so that she could clear the table.  I had 3 plates - food plate, bread plate that was already there and my cornbread plate.  She literally held out her hand for each one.  Why?  Just wait until we leave.  Or ask or something.  That was just so strange to me.  I don't want to clear the table for you.  Also, please note that this was a late lunch and there were literally 4 other customers (2 couples).  Its not like there were people waiting for our table and she had to rush.

Anyway - due to the terrible food and annoying service - I have no desire to ever step foot in this place again.  Too bad because it is close to my office.  I'll stick with Beer Works, Tavern in the Square or... pretty much anywhere else."

227,37,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/21/2016,"Overcrowded inside, but no line to get in. $10 entrance fee. Great for a pre or post Bruins / Celtics game hangout. 2 floors which was pretty cool. First floor is more of the sit down at the bar scene, while the upstairs has room to dance and be more social. This place was packed when I went with some friends on a Saturday night. Very casual - jeans and a t-shirt will do. Mixed drinks and liquor were $7 a piece. 

What docks this place the 2 stars was how busy it was and the capacity. We waited about 10 minutes before we got the bartenders attention, and then after we got our drinks, no where to sit or move for that matter. Definitely regretted spending so much to get in and not getting our money's worth."

Rib tips - doused in honey mustard sauce - whole ribs, literally. Dey exterior but a juicy grey sample meat inside. 

Rib and pulled pork combo. Large spares - nice bark but needed to be finished for longer. Lacking moisture but not bad. Pulled pork was Lacking flavor and Unmemorable. 

Brisket sandwich - rubbery, tough , Unrendered fat. Not much smoke profile. Full slabs of fat all around.

Cucumber salad was fresh but interesting choice adding mustard.

Edamame succotash with crisp beans was excellent. 

Cole slaw was from Sysco, maybe?

A pleasant service but needs some maturity before I'd return."
229,39,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/20/2018,Been here twice and gotten two very different things. First the nachos which weren't that great and then today the platter of pork with coleslaw and mac and cheese and cornbread. The pork was ok. The coleslaw had no flavor and the Mac and cheese was that Mac and cheese you heat up as a child with some weird seasoning on it. Probably won't be going back for a third try- not worth it. Good music though.
230,40,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,7/1/2017,"Five stars alone for Laura, she was welcoming and sweet. 
The food however, needs some work. We can discuss later.
Let me write this again, the five stars is for Laura. If she wasn't there. This review would go a complete other way."
231,41,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,8/23/2017,"Stopped on a Sunday because the sign said Boston's best barbecue, the title is obviously self-proclaimed.

In my experience good barbecue is juicy and tender, Causeway's barbecue is neither of these things and dry & chewy are more accurate depictions. We tried both the pulled chicken and the pulled pork (the former on a sandwich and latter on a salad) and it was pretty much universally bad. We asked for extra dressing just to make the meat more edible and give it some moisture. Barbecue sauce was nothing to write home about, the best comment we can give is on the fries which were edible! We received the bill after a very (VERY) long wait as well, so not too happy with service either (and this was at the bar).  Causeway was overall disappointing and a waste of time & money. We didn't even want the plethora of leftovers because it was that bad."
232,42,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,11/23/2018,AWEOME staff food and drinks. Drinks are strong and reasonable. Bartenders are friendly and accommodating. Food was awesome I had sliders which were super and only 1.25 on Thursdays.
233,43,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,12/7/2018,Amazing atmosphere and sweet bartender.. but the bbq burger and beet Greek salad is the bomb.
234,44,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,8/18/2014,"Oh jeez...what the heck happened...

I've been back twice since the soft opening and it's progressively gone downhill. The first time back, I'd dragged friends along to share my excitement. We ordered two rib platters and 3 brisket sandwiches. The ribs were so tough I ended up with a lot of it left on my plate. My friends' sandwiches remained largely untouched because most of it was bread. We ended up sticking around for drinks, but that also meant dealing with a waitress who was also too busy for us. EVerything took a really long time, and when asked about their alcohol selection, she had to run to the bar for every. single. question.

The second time I came back, I dragged the manfriend because I was afraid I was an unfair judge of bbq. We were told it was a 15 minute wait. Sure. Fine. Great. We waited.

15 minutes became 30 minutes before we were seated. Our food came out fast. I knew better than to get ribs this time so I got a pulled pork sandwich. Manfriend ordered a rib platter and left half of it untouched. It was just too tough and his rack of ribs just so happened to be the ones that were too well cooked...(smoked? bbq'ed? burned???). The sides all tasted like they were mixed in the same too-vinegary sauce. 

We live down the street, but last week when I craved bbq, I just ordered from some placed called L. L. Jay's bbq cafe via diningin. :/ Pity; I really wanted to like this place."
235,45,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,2/5/2017,"This was almost a 2 star rating!  The atmosphere bumped it up to 3.  I went on a Sunday and the music was loud, the place was crowded, and it was exactly what we wanted.  The food however, was awful!  The wings were big and tasted more like baked chicken.  They weren't like the smoked wings I'm used to but a friend of mine enjoyed the sauce.  The sides were worst.  The macaroni and cheese was not a crowd pleaser neither were the greens.  The red beans and rice were edible but lacked flavor.  Next time, I will probably stick with fries and a drink.  I would return for the vine only!  I will say that you may not be catered to by the host or hostess because no one helps you at the door.  You can however find a server that will help you."
236,46,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,11/6/2018,"Sad excuse for ""BBQ"". Came in and we ordered a brisket sandwich and a pulled pork quesadilla. Brisket sandwich was cold and flavorless, but our waitress didn't come by once to ask how anything was or to refill drinks. Quesadilla had hardly any cheese, didn't have any onions or cilantro like listed in the menu , and was as thin as two tortillas."
237,47,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,1/10/2019,Has a good atmosphere and good service especially for the location. Came in on a bruins game and got great service even though it was busy. Food was really good. Just not 5 star worthy in my eyes. You really gotta knock my socks off to get the ol' 5 star from me.
238,48,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,7/24/2016,"I have to be honest...  This is a great spot for a drink near The Garden / North Station, and the food is OK, but a bit of a disappointment after the glowing recommendation I received from a neighborhood local I met on the train coming home from Maine (shame on me for not checking out the Yelp reviews first).

I'd come back for a beer and an appetizer (it's the food that didn't impress), especially since we only share a couple of appetizers (and a few beers), but I'm skeptical (based on those apps.) . 

On the plus side, the service was great.  They ""checked our luggage"" at the for us, the bartender was great (wish I remembered his name), and the open-air windows were nice.  

If in the neighborhood I'd probably stop back for drinks, and maybe I owe them another shot on the food, but, as I said, I'm skeptical."
239,49,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,11/15/2014,"I'm split on this review because some of the food was good and some was straight awful. I would highly recommend the Mac and cheese, cornbread, beans, and potato salad. Their BBQ on the other hand was just no. The pulled pork was so dry I actually coughed, and the ribs were straight bones and barely any meat. The wings were somewhere in the middle. Not bad but not the best. Unfortunately, they really dropped the ball on the bbq food. 

Service was great though and everyone was really friendly!"
240,50,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,6/17/2018,"I made a account just to share how awful this place is. I went there for a night out with friends, and from the moment I entered bouncers and employees were being hostile. We reserved a table weeks in advance but they were ""getting ready"" for an hour..and never got us our bottle.  We had to fight our way upstairs to our reservation and the man at the bar almost took my real id. It's a shame this place is allowed to do business. Save your time and go straight to the Harp next door."
241,51,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,10/6/2018,Had the burger and is was tasty! Great place to grab a bite before a concert at TD Garden. Friendly staff and fast service
242,52,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,9/29/2018,Came here with my friends last Saturday night and had the best time! The staff was super friendly and we got free cover charge at the door. Will definitely be back before a game.
243,53,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,11/18/2019,"I make sure I go to Causeway anytime I'm in Boston! The food is excellent, the service is fast and the servers are polite and go out of their way to take care of their patrons. The bar is amazing with bartenders that actually know how to make drinks properly and they have a great selection of beers. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston Garden! Excellent atmosphere and music, hopefully I can get back to visit soon!"
244,54,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,11/17/2018,Probably the dumbest bar I've been to. You have an entire upstairs bar full of people for both teams for a football game you said you would show with volume. Multiple people ask to turn the strobe lights off in the upstairs section to watch the game and the response is to instead turn the game volume off and turn on the music full volume like a dance floor. Telling of a bar that not only ignores customers but does the exact opposite of what they ask.
245,55,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,1/9/2019,Pretty chill place  for Boston had grilled burritovetabke very good to eat relaxed and cool juice box playing very reccimand chill joint

247,57,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,11/7/2019,"I'be been frequenting Causeway since they have opened! Staff is amazing! New versatile menu (intelligently has evolved for the up and coming area)  is wonderful: pertains to people looking for bar food, people looking for a nice piece of steak/steak tips, or surprisingly vegetarian options! I love making Causeway my go to spot for events at the Garden. Fast food and accommodating service. Food, Drinks, Service won't disappoint, it will become your stable piece of the West End. Check it out!"
248,58,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,9/1/2018,"Atmosphere is nice, food is very mediocre.
Pro-tip: Chicken wings have been successfully & deliciously prepared without smoking them for over a half a century.  (I'm from Buffalo-you don't smoke wings!) With that, avoid their smoked wings-they are awful-and unfort the only option for wings here.  Other items we ordered-pulled pork BBQ sandwich, quesadilla, salad were fine-but nothing to write home about."
249,59,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,5/20/2018,"In a word: eh. Ribs and pulled pork were okay. Nothing to write home about for sure. Meat was a day or two old, as was the cornbread. The Mac and cheese was tasteless and the angry corn was much too flavorful. The spice overpowered the corn forcing me to wonder whether I had ordered the corn or just dry salsa. The broccoli and cheese was broccoli for sure but the cheese was so watered down, legally it probably shouldn't be called cheese anymore. Service was meh. She mostly had a smile on her face but was much more interested in chatting with the regulars at the bar.

TL;DR : I wasn't expecting much for BBQ in Boston and was still disappointed."
250,60,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/30/2016,"The place was pretty nice.. Good food (BBQ steak tips were excellent).  But paid $15 to watch UFC, only to find out (after, of course) they ""can't"" put the TV in front of me on with the fight.  Then the closest TV to me someone stood in front of and they wouldn't ask him to move. 

Good food but, not sure if I'll be back based on that."

Highly recommend."
253,63,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,9/28/2019,"Went here to watch the first Pats game of the season this year. Service was fine, but the food on their ""new"" menu is TERRIBLE. I ordered nachos, and they were disgusting. Soggy and breadlike. Not even sure HOW you can mess up nachos so horribly. I immediately called over the bartender and asked to take them away because they were so awful; she didn't even offer to bring out another plate of them, so they clearly knew they were terrible and couldn't make them better. She later brought out wings as an ""apology"" from the cooks, but as a vegetarian this did nothing for me, but my friends enjoyed them. Would go back for drinks, but would NEVER order food from them ever again. When someone else later ordered nachos the bartender literally asked ""are you sure? She ordered them earlier and said they were terrible"", so they definitely know how bad the food is..."

Do not waste money at this horrible establishment. Go to fenway or Faneuil hall instead."
255,65,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,1/12/2019,"I hate this place so much. Everyone is so mean and they make you wait in line for this ""secret upstairs"". All I know is that Boston should close this place because all the vouchers are so mean to everyone. A drink got poured on me and my friend luke. Everyone boycott this place. It is evil. It doesn't let me to 0 stars but that's what I'm giving it. Actually -1000000"
256,66,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,2/6/2018,"On Superbowl Sunday, we decided we wanted ribs.  We looked around the neighborhood and found this just a block away after Googling ""Best Ribs"".  We ordered on-line for pickup at 5:15, just before the game.  We then got a call at 4:00pm asking why we hadn't picked our food yet, and reminded them it was a 5:15 pickup.  We were a little worried they might just keep our food under a heat lamp until then, but said, nahhh, no one would do that! Wrong!  Once we got the food home , we realized that not only did they they do this, and charged us $54.00 for a rack and 1/2 of ribs, we found the food completely inedible.  Heed this review:  DO NOT ORDER TAKEOUT FROM THIS PLACE.  We sent an email with what happened, and guess what?  No response, so they clearly don't have any concern for their customers.  Google, you steered us completely wrong on this one, the ribs were the worst!"
257,67,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,8/21/2019,"Among the worst meals I have ever had. Potato salad tasted as if it had turned, ""fiery corn"" also tasted ""off."" Pulled pork was just pulled pork with some sauce poured over it. Table did not seem clean. Yuck. Love BBQ, and was looking for a new place to try. Happened to be in the neighborhood so thought I would try it. Never again! The waitress said they were changing their menu at the end of the week and would no longer be doing barbecue. But with that kind of indifference I'm not sure changing the menu will help."
258,68,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,12/26/2016,"Went here for quick eats before a Celtic's game since all others were packed. I was not disappointed, it was less crowded here and the service was prompt.

Their fries are yummy and quesadillas also!

Would definitely recommend this place if you want to get away from the other super crowded spots on Canal St."
259,69,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,8/7/2018,"This place was recommended by two people, but it was truly disappointing. The guy who served us was great, but the food was horrible. I ordered the brisket platter. I don't know what it was but it wasn't brisket. It was more like really thin steak that was cooked so well done it felt like I was eating a belt. It was covered with an ok BBQ sauce, which is how I was able to eat it. My beans and rice side had zero flavor unless cardboard is a flavor. My wife said her steak tips we're ok, but wouldn't want to eat there again. There were a few positives, the waiter was great, the angry corn was decent, and they served ice cold pineapple juice. That being said I wouldn't go her again. The only reason I gave it two stars was the waiter."

263,73,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,1/14/2018,"Fun bar, typical Boston prices, and located in the TD Garden area (a very active nightlife area). There are plenty of TVs if you are interested in watching any sports games while having a drink. Service is nothing to rave about, but is never lacking. Drinks come without any frills, the bartenders just want to serve you and move on to the next customer with speed in mind. Late at night, the upstairs is turned into more of club scene."
264,74,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,8/13/2017,"Echoing several other reviews, the service here is excellent and the food is a disaster. Very friendly, comfortable vibe! But man. The BBQ was stunningly bad."
265,75,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,3 star rating,12/5/2017,For a pub the food is ok. I ordered the brisket. It was cooked well and pretty tender but had lots of fat and gobs of bbq sauce. Fries were ok. Best thing for me was Mac & cheese.
266,76,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,7/5/2015,"Being a southern boy, I am always on the lookout for some tasty barbecue. The menu here does not disappoint. Any place that has greens, cornbread and a real smoker? Please! If you're hungry, order the platters. It's a lot of food!

The service can be hit or miss, depending on if you are upstairs or not. Ask to be seated downstairs. Service seems to be better there."

268,78,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,2 star rating,12/14/2014,"I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars for this place.  It's more like 2.5 stars.  I believe this is a newer place, right across the street from the Garden.  I came here after an early afternoon celtics game with my dad.  

Red flag #1 was the fact that this place was empty and people were bypassing it for a more crowded Harp.  That was a harbinger of things to come.  

First impressions was this place was a BBQ joint, though the menu had some odd items on it.  I went with the Cubano, which was average at best.  The problem was the sides.  Cranberry mashed potatoes?  Really strange tasting.  The baked beans were a disgrace to any BBQ place.  Watery and definitely undercooked.  My dad seemed to enjoy his chicken salad sandwich and clam chowder (with cornbread and olive oil.  Wtf?).  I'm not sure what the chef is really thinking with some of these combinations.

To make it worse, our server was slow despite having literally no one else to serve.  She even forgot what my dad ordered.  Twice.  

I probably will avoid this place in the future for food after a game."
269,79,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,9/16/2015,"Food was Superb  make sure you take advantage of the newly added ""Fried Mac n Cheese balls"" for an appetizer and the ""Chicken Quesadilla"" which was fresh well seasoned and crispy. Great job Chef Jeshua 

The service was 100% on point! The bartender poured and had ready a glass of water with a lemon on side and placed in front of me within a minute of sitting at the bar and proceeded to be very attentive and hospitable. Make sure to ask for Dave and say ""HI"" he is the man!

The overall atmosphere was great from the friendly staff, music and decoration/setup definitely a place you need to experience! 

Thank you Tim for a great time!"
270,80,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,11/4/2017,I would give no star if I could. Waited half an hour in line to get into Causeway and waited another hour to get upstairs to the club? Saw groups of people skip the line and get into the elevator to go up to the same club. Won't be back.
271,81,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,5 star rating,2/2/2015,"This review is long overdue.. I went to the Causeway when I was home just before Christmas.  The service was excellent, as were the wings.  It is extremely hard to find a restaurant in Boston that actually knows how to make Barbecue, and this place has NAILED IT!!

I went there with a fairly big party and we got plenty of items off of the menu.  Wings were unreal, wing tips were also a great appetizer.

I then got the brisket which was extremely tender and cooked just as if I was eating it down in the south at a BBQ joint.

I ended up staying there pretty late into the night and the place filled up with a great crowd of people.  Bartenders were very cool and mixed up some great drinks.  

Overall, I will def be back to this place the next time I am in Boston."
272,82,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,10/1/2017,"We checked out this bar/club after a concert at TD Garden. The wait was not too bad (~10 minutes) to get inside and a $10 cover. We had quick service at the bar and then proceeded to wait in another line for the upstairs ""club"" scene. Once inside, the music was really good- great mix of popular hits and throwbacks. The only down side was the lack of mats to prevent the floors and stairs from being so slippery from spilt drinks."
273,83,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,1 star rating,7/17/2017,"I was very disappointed with the Causeway. I went with a group of friends on Friday night because the line was short to get in, and paid $10 for cover. We got inside and got drinks only to realize that the real line to get into the dance area was inside, after you already paid cover. Sleazy move. Waited 50 MINUTES in line inside and still were not in the dance area. We asked for a refund on our cover charge since we just waited in line for an hour and were thenkicked out of the bar aggressively and swore at by the manager. Will never return and will tell everyone I know that this place is definitely not worth it especially given the other great options in the area."

Their apps are so yummy esp the truly exotic cheese plate, the shrimp, and the pub chips. Sam the bartender (shouldn't every bar in Boston have a Sam?) is great, with super suggestions for spirits suggestions. The chef came and visited with us which really topped off our night.

276,86,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,9/13/2015,"If you're going for drinks, especially beer, you're at the right place. They have a great list of beers on draft and have security which is a plus. The staff is really friendly and they serve you pretty fast. 

The kitchen closes at 10 on Sundays, which was a bummer. My friend had to order for me while I was on my way. 

It's not in the prettiest area but it works overall. Try not to walk over there at night if you're more than 10 minutes away. Not very safe. (Man or woman) 

This place is a nice and organized bar. I wouldn't consider it a restaurant per se although I must say that the food is great and affordable. Had a burrito on a plate and my friend had a pulled pork sandwich with beans and cole slaw. His portion was abundant."
277,87,Causeway Restaurant & Bar,4 star rating,1/19/2015,"Great barbecue! They have a legit smoker and you can tell. We have never had a bad meal here and they have a variety if beer. Its a hidden gem before any game at the garden. 

The quesadilla's are my favorite and the corn bread is spot on. The food is served quickly but with enough time to enjoy yourself. Baked beans were spot on, and the Cesar salad was vert different. They even give you complimentary home made bbq sauces in glass bottles. Nice touch. I highly suggest this new spot!"

281,1,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,3/25/2022,"Of the clutch of coffee shops and cafes in Charlestown MA, incredibly, just this one - Zume's - no longer allows customers to use their bathroom, even in an emergency and after paying for items.  

So if you order at Zume's and gotta go, no luck ""because it's Covid""!? This is the end of March 2022 when Zume's management no longer requires masks. But they keep the bathroom locked behind a hanging curtain?! 

So best advice is go forth to Tatte, Starbuck's, Sorelle's, Style, and other local coffee shops that respect customers enough to maintain an accessible, clean restroom post-Covid."

283,3,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,2/19/2020,"So I have been living in Charlestown since September, but today was my first time to Zume's. I normally make my coffee at home but I'm out of almond milk and thought I'd stop here on my way to work. 

I brought in my Yeti cup figuring that maybe they offer a lower price for bringing your own cup (come one people, let's save Earth one cup at a time). Nope I was in fact charged for a large when I'm sure my 20 oz Yeti is most likely smaller than their large. No almond milk on the counter and I was in a rush so I didn't want to wait back in line to ask for some. Oh well. ""Large"" drip coffee medium roast and yogurt parfait for a whopping $7.38

This is not what bothered me about this visit. I get to work, have a couple morning meetings and finally sit down at my desk to enjoy my parfait. I open it up to find black hairs in the parfait. I would normally be ok and just say let's pull that hair out and carry on, but the more I dig around the more hairs I found. Absolutely foul. This is unforgivable in my mind. I would hope the employees making these parfaits would be wearing a hair net, but clearly not. 

I would love for a manager to reach out to me to resolve this matter. This is appalling for any food industry service. Yuck."

A comfortable oasis on a day when our 1st choice in Charleston for lunch stopped serving at 3 pm and we didn't fancy 'bar snacks'.... and we kept walking.... 

was ZUME'S.

Mom n pop shop NOT a mean big green logo originating in Seattle = a plus.

Solid 4 star coffee house.

287,7,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,11/27/2020,"The breakfast sandwich on the English muffin is great. The service is terrible. The owner, I assume, has been snippy with me every time I've ever been in the shop. I've lived in Charlestown for seven years, and literally only bother going to this shop when I want an excellent sandwich with a side of straight up rude."
288,8,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,10/9/2020,Love that they have oat milk! Makes it an easy yes when suggested. My only suggestion for them would be to have more vegan options. A vegan cookie would have gone great with my London fog!
289,9,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/29/2020,"Great coffee (strong but not harsh) and yummy baked goods. I mean, look at this guy! Super nice people. Will definitely keep visiting."
290,10,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,6/5/2021,I love Zume's. The staff is friendly and the coffee and baked goods are just plain delicious. This is the perfect neighborhood coffee house and one of my favorite parts of living in Charlestown.
291,11,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,8/18/2019,"Honestly though,
I'm all for supporting local. I walked by this place alot and it was always closed. I finally was around when open so i gave it a try. Man did I soon regret that.  looked at the menu for a bit, then once decided was still ignored,for a few mins. They finally notice me and I order. Got a hot salted caramel latte, even tho I ordered oded. Didn't say anything because i figured maybe I didbt say iced eveb tho I'm almost positive i did. Then I get the cup, its barely halfway full, AND its like salt water. So NASTY. Honestly, ill just stick to the Starbucks 2 more minutes down the road."
292,12,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,9/5/2020,"The best coffee and community in Boston!

So stoked they have added vegan options to the menu. 

The chickpea wrap is amazing!! A must visit when in Charlestown, great location right on Main Street."
293,13,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/1/2019,Zume's had a friendly atmosphere and a lot of choices for breakfast. I got the egg and cheese sandwich on an English muffin (the best English muffin I've had in a long time).
294,14,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,11/1/2019,"Left and went to Starbucks. No power outlets, WiFi was terrible in that it kicked you off every 15 minutes. Friendly staff, ok coffee, not a place to hang out. I was going to stay for a while and get more to Eat and drink, but I had to leave because I needed a power outlet. Starbucks it is."
295,15,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,6/12/2019,"Delicious english muffins and breakfast sandwiches! Cute place to sit and get work done, lots of fun artwork and interesting people."
296,16,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/31/2016,"Dude, yes!
The food was good. Got the sausage breakfast sandwich on a croissant.
The coffee was good too. Gotta iced mocha with an extra shot.
The red chairs were sooooo cozy.
The vibe was super chill.
Coming again during my visit here."
297,17,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,10/23/2019,"Went here for the first time this morning - I might be a regular customer from now on! Very friendly service, a great tasting americano (not acidic at all) and a very fluffy glazed donut. All in all a great experience."
298,18,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,1/15/2019,"I have been coming to Zumes for years as I love to support local businesses, but after a few recent visits that were below average I will now be finding a new coffee shop. Their iced coffee is one of my favorites, but that does not outweigh the poor (and often rude) service that I have received during my recent visits. There are not many things that can turn me off of a place I once loved, but rude service is just not appreciated, nor is it appropriate."
299,19,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,10/23/2017,"I sat here for about an hour or so to do some work, and I also ordered an iced chai tea latte, which was good, but this review is mostly about the service! I forgot my wallet, and didn't realize until about an hour later, after Zume's had closed! However, one of the baristas answered immediately, and when I mentioned the wallet, she said she'd put it in their safe after checking to see if there was any contact info inside. They were still closing, so she said I could come by and get it if I could be there in the next few minutes. Overall, she went above and beyond to help me, and I'm super grateful!"
300,20,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,5/1/2018,"Zumes has been a Charlestown staple for some time now.  The coffee and food appeals to a wide selection of tastes.

I love the display of local art (which is updated regularly).

The service at Zumes is friendly, well organized and efficient.

There is always a hustle and bustle adding to the friendly vibe.

I personally prefer supporting local business owners."
301,21,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,5/23/2018,"When Zume's first reopened, I was not impressed. But 5 years later (and 1 ""no strollers inside"" policy) my opinion of this place has really changed. I've seen a conscious effort from management over the last few years to be more welcoming and hire more friendly staff. They've also rolled out several new food options including a larger variety of pastries and quick to-go lunch options like burritos and sandwiches. 

I think this place has finally become what Charlestown needed - a great little neighborhood coffee shop for the locals. Here's hoping that people continue to come here and support Zume's in spite of the new Starbucks down the block."
302,22,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,9/13/2015,"Love that this shop is so near my home, though that has no bearing on my review.

The interior is a cozy mix of industrial coffee house - sort of an ideal presentation in 2015. That interior alone is nothing to write home about, though the original wall art is always a welcome display. (I just wish I could afford some of it!)

The stars of this place is the food and coffee - just what you'd hope for at a ""coffee"" shop.

I got an Americano and added a touch of cream and sugar. (I prefer it con panna, but I realize not all coffee shops have whipped cream. No worries, it was still a great tasting espresso.)

Baked goods are always hit or miss to me. Sometimes they taste old, and you're sad you even gave them a shot. Not these! The quiche are made, then frozen, then thawed for display - still relatively fresh. My bacon and swiss quiche could have easily been fresh. After heating, the crust was a bit dry and softened under the reheating, but the lovely inside bits made it all come together nicely. It's so easy to ruin a quiche when runny eggs or too much of any one ingredient. These tiny pockets were harmoniously made.

Then I got the key lime tart. My hopes of saving it for later were a failure. That flamed marshmallow topper and golden graham crust were too luscious to ignore after my quiche. My remaining espresso needed a partner with whom to go down gracefully. Wow! Crusts on deserts are my favorite part. Faintly buttery, crispy but soft, and just a little sweet. The filling was everything you'd hope for from a quality pasty - not the lime green stuff you find in a sad, pre-packaged box. The marshmallow topping hid that glorious secret (normal colored filling!) all-too-well. Sorry, tart, I just couldn't save it for later. 

Which is ok, since I hope to be a regular at this place.

And, lest I forget, the staff were friendly and helpful. Nice crew."
303,23,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,2/28/2019,"Great little coffee shop with friendly service and good snacks. Coffee is full of great flavor, molasses cookies are incredible and the service is friendly. They have good little seating areas with local art on the wall. Nice place to spend some time."
304,24,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,1/13/2019,Coffee is okay. Sometimes it tastes burnt. Ordered a breakfast sandwiches that was really tough to eat. The bagel was definitely not fresh.
305,25,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/27/2019,"Been living in Charlestown for 30+ years and this place is legit. If you have kids, it's perfect. The nitro coffee is amazing and all the food is delicious. All the ""poor service"" reviews are BS. Support local business!  Can't miss."
306,26,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,4/25/2019,"You'd be hard-pressed to find a better breakfast sandwich with an english muffin. I got the sausage egg and cheese and it was a total knockout. It's essentially a Portuguese EM, fluffy and moist. Incredible."
307,27,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,4/23/2018,"The 5 stars is for their version of an English Muffin . More often than not I have to use a condiment on breakfast sandwiches due to the bread being so dry . I have now gotten the sausage breakfast sandwich three days in a row and each day it has been consistent . I'm a simple coffee girl . I just like black iced and they provide that at a decent price and not tasting burnt . I just moved in around the corner so I will pick this over Starbucks , only minus is it's very limited seating and it's usually full"
308,28,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,8/29/2018,"I really want to like this place but I can't. 

On multiple occasions I have been treated rudely by staff. The least of which has been eye rolls when ordering as I am not completely familiar with the menu. The worst is when I asked for a ""regular"" coffee as many small coffee shops have a regular and large size and getting rudely asked ""well, what is a regular?"" The staff here could save a lot of time and energy if they weren't so rude. 

Another problem I have is their hours. If they were open later I'm sure they would have more customers. I would rather support a local business like Zume's but if they make it difficult for me I can just use my drip coffee machine at home."
309,29,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,11/8/2018,"My girlfriend and I were staying in Charlestown and this cool little place was right down the street.  The staff is great! We had some cool conversation waiting for my coffees.  The Incredible Hulk singing ""Thriller"" on Halloween made my day!"
310,30,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,6/25/2018,"I really can't wait until cafe Nero comes to Charlestown and runs this place out of town! I have been there 3 times since it is right down the street from where I live and the 3rd trip will be my last.  So, the first time I went to Zume's I wanted a cold brew which they did not have, even though every coffee shop in the city including Dunkin Donuts now has cold brew. The second time I slept in on a weekend day and was craving a breakfast sandwich- well this is the only coffee shop I've ever heard of that does not serve breakfast past a certain time( like after 10:30 or 11am). I decided to go back because i was excited to hear that They finally served cold brew. So I went in and ordered a medium- $6.26.  I honestly thought she was kidding. Needless to say, I will not be back . It's too bad because it is a great space in a great location!"
311,31,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,12/19/2019,I wanted to try this place for a while and it didnt disappoint! The coffee was delicious and fresh. I got a breakfast sandwich and it was great. I highly recommend Zume's!
312,32,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/8/2018,"Just Okay

We wanted a cup of coffee and a few minutes to relax, so we popped in here.  While there was certainly wrong with anything (except the wi-fi), there was also certainly nothing memorable the place.  The service was adequate, the coffee was decent, the seating was comfortable, and the wi-fi didn't work."
313,33,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/10/2018,Stop by today for lunch. Clean quiet atmosphere in this coffee house. Staff was very helpful and ready to take my order. I purchased a lemonade and black iced tea. It was awesome! The cranberry and chicken salad was also awesome except for the small bone that pierced my tongue.
314,34,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,8/8/2016,"Good coffee and the pastries are amazing really tasty and fresh not super sweet I think they have the right amount of everything, the staff is always nice and patient if you are trying to decide what to order, the vibe in the place is chill and it welcomes you to stay and relax I recommend it if you are around !"
315,35,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,12/9/2017,"Poor service 
Had to argue to get a simple drink the way I like it 
Not even a simple thank you 
Rude in a word 
Coffee marginal at best 
Atmosphere okay and comfortable"
316,36,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,8/22/2018,"Comfortable chair, great coffee and breakfast sandwiches and pastry.  Relaxing and laid back. Friendly staff."
317,37,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/23/2016,"Zume's is the best.  Coffee is consistent and good.  Customer service is great.  I highly recommend their baked goods and menu items.  I enjoy the egg and cheese bagel- without cheese, add ham and extra egg.  It's under $5, what a deal.

The chocolate chip cookie is like crack.  Sometimes I wish I had never tried a chocolate chip cookie from Zume's.  But I did, and now when I want to treat myself I get them.  They are huge, about 3-4 times the size of a normal cookie.  I like to enjoy 2 at a time.  Soft chewy center, large chunks of chocolate, and they are huge."
318,38,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,4/25/2014,"This is just what Charlestown was lacking; a laid back place to sip your latte and read or chat with some friends. Aside from the delicious coffee, this place is aesthetically pleasing with it's modern industrial feel. The artwork adds character and shows the connection to the community.

As an animal lover, it is great to see everyone gather with their pups outside, as Zume's shows their 4 legged friend support! All and all,  I am a lover of independent coffee shops and this place does meet everything I like in them. 

The only thing I wish is that they were open later at night. But being in Charlestown, the foot traffic may not be worth the extended hours! 

Keep it up guys!"
319,39,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,6/9/2015,"This is a cool little neighborhood place, where the look, right down to the pastry cases, definitely is equipped like McBucks, but that is where the comparison stops. They have fantastic baked goods, and a sizeable hot breakfast and sandwich array that comes out of a kitchen, not a Star-Trek-Meets-Suzy Homemaker convection warmer.  The coffee?  Very very good.  The only reason I drop it a star is because they have a ton of people working there, but when the coffee bar is slammed, and it's slammed, management only has one barista on? The place is packed as it's one of the few good breakfasteries around, so tell Scrooge McDuck to come up with a touch more cash for another pair of hands on the bar, please."
320,40,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,9/15/2017,"Had a very negative experience at Zume's. Went in for a coffee and food with friends midday after stroller bootcamp at the monument. We had two strollers between the four of us for our 3 month old babies. 

After ordering we were told that the stroller situation has been a bit of a problem there. They have implemented a no stroller policy recently and next time we cannot bring our strollers in.  We drank our coffee and before we were heading out another employee told us that we had to go outside and we cannot stay with our strollers and there is even a sign on the door. I informed both of the women that this was discrimination and we will not be returning.

How is this right? There was plenty of room for other customers to get by. Who will they discriminate against next? 

We live in the city... would they be paying for a replacement stroller if it were to be stolen out front? How can they expect a mother with young children to get her kids and belongings out of the stroller and come in and order...that is not feasible. 

I am all for supporting small local businesses but not when they mistreat their customers. Good luck with Starbucks coming in right down the street. I am sure they would be happy to have the business of mothers with children."
321,41,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,1/30/2019,"They intentionally have no outlets, which as someone who works remotely defeats the purpose of a coffee shop. I totally understand not wanting people to take advantage, but having no outlets seems excessive and petty. Food is fine"
322,42,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,6/17/2019,Love the interior and the cozy cafe feel. I typically order a medium iced coffee and it is very good. The sandwiches are made to order and made with fresh ingredients. It's one of my favorite places in the Charlestown area.
323,43,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,4/26/2015,"Turkey wrap is awesome. Convenience of getting said turkey warp is not. My first visit, I attempted to order at 11:56 and was informed the kitchen doesn't open till 12. So I stood aside for 4 minutes so that I could get back in line to order. Second time I got there a few minutes before 3. Waited in line. When it was my turn to order, they said the kitchen closed at 3.

I would eat here again, but I will never go out of my way to do so. If I was starving between 1215 and 245 and happen to find self directly in front of zumes and it was too inconvenient to go somewhere else maybe I'd give them another shot. 

I have also tried the iced coffee. It's not really anything special."
324,44,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,12/16/2015,"I love this spot whenever I'm in the area and looking for a quick bite I like to stop by and grab the avocado turkey sandwich it's so delicious. I haven't tried their coffee but their chai lattes are really good as well if you are looking for an alternative. The staff is super friendly and loves answering questions you might have. 

This spot is quiet for reading and has comfortable lounge chairs, the only drawback is that they don't have outlets so if you are looking to get some work done on your laptop it's a great spot until your battery runs out of charge."
325,45,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,9/8/2018,"Love the products great coffee and breakfast sandwiches but super disappointed in the service. I asked for a shot of espresso over ice in a large cup. I'm pregnant so I nurse my coffee/caffeine all day and need to have sufficient water/ice with it to stay hydrated. They pulled a small cup so I said no bigger -- they gave me a medium and then tried to charge almost $5 for a latte!  I said the price/product was wrong when it rang up and long story short they charge by the cup size regardless of what's in it. They were completely inflexible with the policy, despite my pregnancy and urging, they would not budge nor would they explain the rationale behind the policy. I hate to write a bad review - blame it on the hormones - but this was very disappointing to me."
326,46,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,8/19/2018,"Unfortunately, I think this place is very over-priced. A large cold brew is 8.51 -- they told me it's priced so high because it's George Howell brand...however I went past the George Howell booth at Boston Public Market and a large cold brew is only 5.00."
327,47,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,8/23/2018,"I am a pregnant woman who has lived in the Boston area for years. I went into this coffee shop to support a local business, rather than going to Starbucks down the street. I ordered an ice coffee and sat at the counter and ate a chia seed pudding that I had purchased at a local juicery. Despite having bought a coffee, the owner kicked me out for having brought ""outside food."" Horrible experience, I will never be back and will not recommend anyone else to come here in the future."
328,48,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,1/11/2018,"I've been to Zume's many times and each time I go in I am always blown away. All the staff is polite. They have great non-lactose milk options for coffee. But, the best part has to be their breakfast sandwiches; specially their 'english muffin"". It's soft, dense and buttery, almost like a biscuit. My go-to sandwich is the sausage, egg and cheese on the english muffin. It won't disappoint!"
329,49,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,5/28/2017,I love Zume's!!!  I have been going there since they opened. The coffee is more expensive than Dunkin Donuts however the quality of the beverages and food as well as atmosphere make it something I like doing for me and my 
330,50,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,8/20/2017,A small intimate coffee house with friendly staff and delicious coffee. Their pastries are also very good. Despite being a neighborhood favorite Zume's frequently has a relaxed environment.
331,51,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,12/15/2016,Tried this place today instead of my regular Dunkin' Donuts and was pleasantly surprised. Really good coffee and quick service.
332,52,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,1/3/2015,"Great hot chocolate! I come all the way from Roxbury just for it. This is one of those rare coffee houses where the employees know your name and your order as soon as you step up to the counter. Fyi, don't go during the day on weekdays looking for a seat, all the moms with their babies crowd the place. I almost got taken out by a stroller once. Get your drinks and go, unless its in the evening by then all housewives are home making dinner lol"
333,53,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/15/2015,"Things I love at Zumes: the cookies (the best in Boston!!), the breakfast sandwich on English muffin, the baked goods (great muffins), and of course the coffee.  

But I wish they had more sandwich options.  They used to have heated ones but stopped.  Those should come back (especially in the winter months).  And I wish you could get smaller sized smoothies (the one size is just too big)."
334,54,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,9/30/2016,Coffee was solid and the baked good options looked decent but not overly tempting. Good for a quick drop-in.
335,55,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,10/23/2018,"Love that it's a 10 minute walk from my office. Coffee and chai tea latte has always been consistent. I've had their breakfast sandwiches and they're pretty standard. Staff can be a hit or miss, but don't let that turn you off. Just sip sip away!"
336,56,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,11/22/2017,"Espresso drinks are weak, service poor. After various purchases and complementing the owner/manger on the decor, I was treated rudely by her for a humble request (certainly no customer first attitude shown)."
337,57,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,10/30/2013,Wish they started serving lunch earlier for the working people. It can't be that hard. When the place is busy it is hard to hear them call your name. Food was good.
338,58,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,2/4/2018,"First of all, I support small businesses and want to see them thrive but Zume's customer service has been so variable - sometimes they are ok but more often then not (lately) they have been unwelcoming/rude- it def needs improvement ( esp now that Starbucks is open). As far as food items go, Some items are great (English muffin sandwiches, ice coffee) but some things are incredibly overpriced (iced cold brew). If you want to keep customers, improve your customer service!"
339,59,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,12/13/2017,"Great, warm coffee shop! Downfall is they don't don't have Apple Pay, outlets for a phone or computer charge and don't take Amex. I spend at the very minimum $50 a week for coffee and lunch while I try to do some casual computer work before or after work. Unfortunately they lose out on me as a customer and many more who are looking for the same. I wish they would add these amenities to stay in the game now that Starbucks is here..."
340,60,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,3/11/2017,"Solid and consistent coffee and food at every visit. I wish they had more seating, granted I go at peak times. My favorite are the Latte's, always on point and keep me going for the entire day."
341,61,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,8/27/2018,"I came here for a quick grab and go breakfast and gotta say they've got ONE OF THE BEST ICE COFFEE around!  I'm picky with iced coffee since I like it black and no sugar/added flavors, but this ice coffee has some good fragrances and taste making it so refreshing to have!  I would come here again just for the ice coffee.  And also the blueberry coffee cake :)"
342,62,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,4/12/2014,"I've been here a few times and have enjoyed their (excellent) desserts, (excellent) drinks - tea and coffee all seem creative enough and tasty, and (excellent) sandwiches.
This place is typical for a good local coffee house, nothing crazy. But it's cozy, I've always enjoyed my experiences, the staff, and the food has always made me happy."
343,63,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,9/4/2016,"Just discovered this place.   Very friendly vibe, comfortable armchairs, fast service, good latte, amazing looking food.   Wish I hadn't already had brunch.  I'll be back next week."
344,64,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,4/30/2016,"Great place for a coffee to go, reading a book or doing some work. They take credit card, have bar stools and comfy red reading chairs, and have yummy pastries."
345,65,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,6/24/2014,"Zume's always seems to make my day a little better. 
The staff is always nice, which you might think is standard, but it's really not in most places. It's a feel good local charlestown place and I always head over after Yoga. 

If you are looking for French Vanilla, ask for Hazelnut and Vanilla flavors."
346,66,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,2/12/2015,"Visiting the area, we decided to have lunch here. We got the chai latte and Hunky Monkey protein smoothie along with a turkey avocado ciabatta panini. Everything is DELICIOUS!!! I love the artsy/industrial design of the place, and everything on the menu is healthy. We will probably be coming back during our visit."
347,67,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,9/18/2014,"Zume's makes the best latte in the city. I don't know what their secret is but they are amazing.

I was hesitant to go after reading a few reviews about the service but I have never had a bad experience. 

The pastries are made in house and are fantastic. You have to try a cinnamon snail!"
348,68,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,5/25/2017,"As much hype as people give this place, I just don't see it! Ive been in a handful of times and have found that the coffee is very bland & watery, and that some of the staff (manager) is just very unfriendly. Hoping to have a more pleasant experience in the future"
349,69,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,2/11/2016,"No wall outlets. But friendly staff. Decent coffee, decent food. The inside is pretty cozy, and every time I've been, there's plenty of seating. It's a very typical coffee shop feel to it. It's a hard choice between 3 and 4 stars for me, but it's not much out of the ordinary. I wouldn't tell someone not to go, especially if you're looking for a nice little spot in Charlestown."
350,70,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,12/24/2013,"I love this place! I've seen a few Boston celebs in here so it must be good!  The coffee is always good and they have a great bakery display of yumminess. I personally enjoy the chocolate chunk cookie; definitely something to share. 

They only serve breakfast until 12 on weekends so you late risers should get there before noon. The egg sandwich is simple and delicious. 

Definitely try them out if you're in the area!"
351,71,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/15/2013,"This is a sold three star joint!  

I live within walking distance of Zume's and I have found that I prefer their lunch options over Sorelle.  While Sorelle may boast a larger sandwich menu, I find that the choices I've made in the sandwich category have been quite good.  Three standouts for me have been the Cuban, the Turkey and Avocado, and Chicken and Goat Cheese.  For breakfast, I am partial to the egg sandwich & the salmon & lox on a bagel.  Breakfast options can be a bit steep in price, though I find that I am full for a long period of time.  

I don't tend to like strong coffee, so when I do get coffee it does tend to be iced coffee in the summer.  In addition, I am partial to the Crimson Berry Iced Tea.  That is a fave of mine.  

Generally I get my stuff and leave.  As others have stated, many people do tend to camp out (perhaps due to the free wi-fi) and there is limited seating.  Since the remodel was done, I feel like there is even less seating.  While on the subject of the remodel, I feel like it became more industrial and austere in terms of the atmosphere.  The remodel did strip the place of some of its character, in addition it feels like the public space is smaller.  While I am sure that the work environment may be better for staff, for me that was a recognizable difference.  Though, all this doesn't bug me too much as I am a ""to-go"" girl.  

I do give the place props for showcasing local artists.  There's always new artists exhibiting their art, and you can't help but to check out the walls each time you come in."

(refer back to preface)  Idk if thats good or bad but its now my coffee of choice.  Finally, I enjoy all their food.  Obviously its a coffee shop and should be graded more heavely on the coffee but again, i dont have a coffee palett so for me to critique on that aspect would be remiss, but I couldnt see it not being delicious as the the americanos seem to fly out the door."
353,73,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,11/22/2013,"Had to try the English muffin and didn't regret it at all! The coffee was great too but I'm still addicted to DD. 

The layout of the chairs was a little odd to me... It's mostly sofas that line the walls with a small table next to each one, like I was waiting to get a foot massage. 

Worth a try!"

355,75,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,3/22/2013,"Came here to say I love Zume's as my local coffee shop. Nice strong coffee and their 10lb cookies are amazing! I strongly recommend you try them. 

I'm only giving 3 strars through as there are often a lot of ""campers"" who sit all morning. With minimal seating, this can be frustrating for people who do want to eat. I will say that I'm not sure there's much they can do about this though as I would assume asking people to leave is the worse of two evils.

The Roasted Vegetable Sandwich was pretty slimey too. Go with the Caprese!

Lastly, I think the renovations look great."
356,76,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,4/6/2014,"I love this place; not just because it's a 3 min walk from my condo, but because they have a great atmosphere, great product & awesome staff.
It's always packed I wish they stayed open later."
357,77,Zume's Coffee House,3 star rating,5/3/2016,"It's a really cool atmosphere but the coffee is just OK. Much prefer the actual coffee from Wholefoods across the street.  
One thing I do like are the breakfast sandwiches."
358,78,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,11/17/2014,"I've finally decided to bite the bullet and write a review. I've ventured to Zumes about 4 times over the last two months. Each time I have had the older lady or the older man which I expect are the owners of the establishment.  I have been less than pleased with their service.  They seem to be quick to judge and always huff and puff while they are working.  My latte was warm and was only filled about 3/4 of the way and the rest was foam. Sorry, but every latte I have ever had it was roughly 1/2"" to 3/4"" of the top filled and the rest foam. I told them to fill it up and they said, ""That is how we make them here."" I said, ""Well that's not how a latte is supposed to be. Can you please fill it up?"" And they grumbled. People are right. They appear like they are doing a favor to their customers.  We are paying YOU for a product, not for your attitude. 

The only reason this coffee place is still open is because of the local community's love for small businesses.  If it were not for the Charlestown crowd this place would have closed down long ago."
359,79,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,8/16/2015,"Excellent coffee here, some of the best I've had in the city of Boston. The only thing holding it back is that the breakfast sandwich was good, but not great. That being said, I love the coffee so I'll be there as much as possible."
360,80,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,2/29/2016,"The place where they know your name, and coffee order. 

There's something to be said for walking into a joint where the staff know who you are, and what you want. This place is filled with very friendly and welcoming neighborhood people. The coffee is much better than the Dunk's across the street, and at a similar price point as Starbucks. 

I've tried a number of the breakfast and lunch sandwiches, but my go to order when I'm feeling indulgent is the bagel and lox. Open faced bagel and lox sandwich with capers, red onion, and tomato.

The muffins are spot on as well if you're looking for something a little less than an entire sandwich.

One thing I've noticed is that special orders sometimes get mishandled more times than they should, but mistakes happen, and the staff is always more than happy to rectify the order."
361,81,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,7/8/2012,"Zume's is a great coffeehouse! My friends and I rented a house nearby for a weekend in Boston and this place was conveniently located two blocks from our apartment.

They have some amazing drinks here and the staff is super chill and friendly.  They have plenty of couches and chairs to sit down and unwind.  They also sell local art, which are nicely displayed on their walls."
362,82,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,8/17/2010,"Zume's has very good espresso, latte's, cappuccinos, coffee and teas. Their food menu is very good as well. Muffins, scones, donuts and hot breakfast sandwiches. Very  very good. My only complaint is how expensive it is to come here. Other then that it would be five stars in my book.
Add on to previous review:
I moved Zumes down two starts. Though there coffee and food is very good I've noticed a disturbing decrease in customer service. It seems as if they are frustrated taking your order. 
My fiance' went in the other day to do work on her lap top. As she was setting up her lap top the owner came up to her and told her she had to buy food or coffee to work their. This was before she even had a chance to order anything. He was very rude and spoke to her like someone who was in middle school hanging out. 
Very disappointed in the ownership and his manners."
363,83,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,12/23/2009,"Really cute, cozy place. This is so close to being the ideal neighborhood coffee shop.  Just one problem: snotty staff.

I brought my laptop and went to plug it in and couldn't find any outlets.  I asked the girl at the counter if they had any outlets available and she said, ""no""  (rather curtly).  I then found a hidden outlet and plugged in.  Almost immediately a woman whom I assume to be the owner or manager rushed over to me, taps me on the shoulder and says, ""We DON'T have outlets for a REASON.""  Her tone was snarky and condescending - and she didn't tell me what that REASON was.  I told her my battery was dead so I would have to leave the cafe and go elsewhere. To which she replied, ""OK"".

Her tone was incredibly rude - and that's what turned me off.  

A few other things that tipped the scale to actually make me dislike the place:  I ordered a latte and it was lukewarm, watered-down and less than half full.  I also think its weird to have such a problem with someone wanting to plug in a laptop.

Who knew it as such a crime to plug in your laptop in a cafe.
I won't be going back."
364,84,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,8/26/2009,"I used to be a huge fan of Zumes just until up about a month ago. I was ordering 3 shots of espresso over ice and then adding some milk. After ordering one morning, one of the owners came up to me (while I was talking on my cell phone) and interrupted my conversation to tell me he was going to charge me for a latte the next I came in. I have never had a problem with ordering this drink before at any other cafes...it really turned me off. I have experienced the staff to be rude and not very friendly. When you go into a shop early in the morning a smile would really be nice! 
The reason it gets two stars from me is because their sandwiches are pretty good and they have good desserts and doughnuts."
365,85,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,6/10/2009,"I wish I could say that I love Zume's because I love the concept of it - and I actually do get my coffee there some mornings, and other mornings at Dunkin Donuts. It all depends on whether I feel like  starting my day with a scowl or a smile. Believe it or not, the ruder, less friendly option is at Zume's, not Dunkin Donuts!  The staff don't really seem to enjoy what they do at all.  In this economy, I often leave there thinking, why not let someone who'd actually like to be working do this job?

Why do I bother with Zume's? The coffee is stronger than D&D, and they have some healthy breakfast options. But that's about it.  From my experience, the staff at Zume's seem as though they are doing you the hugest favor by waiting on you at all. I've rarely seen any of them smile, and I often leave there feeling a little bit hassled and like I've just offended them by paying $7 for a coffee, banana, apple and yogurt. 

There is one blonde girl who works at the counter who is pretty sweet, and the woman who makes the food in the back is very nice, but everyone else leaves me cold. There are several people who I literally have never seen crack even the semblance of a smile in the entire year I've been going there. Not the best way to start the day."
366,86,Zume's Coffee House,5 star rating,6/20/2015,"Great service, great iced coffee. great location. I've been coming here for lunch every once in a while for the last few weeks, and it's a great spot. The breakfast sandwich on an english muffin pushed me over the edge, and onto yelp for the five star review!"
367,87,Zume's Coffee House,2 star rating,11/21/2010,"Decent food, cute atmosphere (for Charlestown...)...but the staff is RUDE. You walk in and begin to browse the menu and they are like, ""What do you want""...if you tell them you need a minute to decide, they will stare at you until you make up your mind. 
Not the kind of place you want to hang out and read the paper on a Sunday with your coffee. Wish there were more non-chain coffee shops!!!"
368,88,Zume's Coffee House,4 star rating,3/3/2010,"Found myself in Charlestown and needed to kill some time. We opted for this coffee shop. I really enjoyed sipping coffee here and it makes me think of those days when I lived in Boston and how there was SPACE to just sit and think! LOL. The coffee house has a bit of a Bohemian feel to it, wooden floors, and a few nice chairs. I had a slice of carrot cake and a coffee. The carrot cake was excellent. Moist and flavourful. It was a huge slice and I couldn't finish the whole thing. We were able to sit for about 2 hours with no one trying to kick us out. 

Also, on the day I left Charlestown, my best friend and I went in to grab some breakfast and she was raving about their english muffins. She says they make their own. I tried an egg and cheese on english muffin. She was right. The english muffin was fluffy and light. Better than anything Thomas could ever make ;-) This place is a winner!"
369,89,Zume's Coffee House,1 star rating,6/2/2014,"Worst customer experience ever - I was recently back to Charlestown after 15 years since moving away. I thought a place like Zume would be a good addition to an otherwise coffee desert. After ordering a coffee I noticed that there were no electrical outlets to charge my dead phone. When I asked, the young lady behind the counter said ""we don't have any customer outlets."" (Strange!)  Then when I pick up my drink I noticed that there was a plug on the back counter with one of the employees phones plugged in. I asked if I could charge my dead phone in that outlet, a manager/owner(?) was called over who told me with a total dead-pan look before walking away: ""that's for employees, we don't have power for customers."" That's it! No ""I'm sorry buts..."", No doing one little favor for a customer... Not the least bit of conciliatory offering what so ever! This place is the worse and deserves to go out of business.

ps: The iced coffee is just OK"
370,0,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,4/4/2022,Veggie tagine!!! Soooo good. It was great to have some yummy hot stewed veggies with Harrissa on a cold day!! Great vegetarian option in Boston. I love this place.
371,1,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,11/28/2021,"Really interested in getting some of the goat in the butcher section next time.

372,2,Garden Halal Meat,1 star rating,3/1/2022,"I will love the owner of this place to call me back!!! Seriously I stopped by today and the guy who cuts the meat, he looks very skinny  was very uncomfortable! He was asking me why I speak 2 different language!!! can you believe that was!! He looks at me in dirty way!! Very uncomfortable and scary!!!I can't believe I'm out of the store safe!!!!"
373,3,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,9/30/2021,$2 for a massive delicious slice of pizza. Chicken kebab was fire too. Best kept secret in Boston.
374,4,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,10/30/2021,"We found this place near the end of our stay in Boston.  The food was really delicious and a good value for the price.  We split an entree with chicken, vegetables (peas and green beans, potatoes) and rice.  The entree came with a salad that had some very tasty pickled veggies on top.  It seemed like you might be able to choose bread instead of rice with the entree.    If you want to pay with a credit card you have to go downstairs and my husband said there was a bad smell down there.  Takeout comes in styrofoam with plasticware."
375,5,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,1/5/2020,"awesome hole in the wall type of ethnic grocery shop underground with a small diner on street level. They sell algerian style beef and veggies and you can buy turkish and moroccan style spices, cookies and baklava there. If you like exotic food and snacks, def give it a try."
376,6,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,2/22/2020,"My go to spot for halal meat in the city.
They have pre-cleaned and pre-packaged drumsticks and chicken breasts. Fresh meat/chicken is also available on order as per your request (small pieces or large)"
377,7,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,2/12/2021,"I found this place by sheer accident, while I was visiting the Heymarket. As others here mentioned, it is a literally a hole in the wall. Nothing fancy about this store at all, but the meat is always super fresh. For some reason the store often has a bad smell, especially on Friday and Saturday. Not sure what the reason is but be warned. The staff are very welcoming, and the service is quick. I've never been disappointed with any of my purchases here."
378,8,Garden Halal Meat,2 star rating,4/19/2017,"I was very disappointed by the food here. Went in with high expectations to try some good halal food but everything was below average, wasn't worth the wait time and money. 

Tried the chicken platter and it was missing flavor. Also got the sandwich and wasn't impressed by it at all.

Definitely not recommend this place if you have had real halal food before."
379,9,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,6/13/2015,"This morning while shopping at Haymarket I stopped in at Garden Halal Meat. This little ""hole in the wall"" store is located in the basement level but is a haven for incredible meat, fish and Middle Eastern foods.

We ended up buying fresh shrimp, naan as well as some spices. The staff here isn't the most receptive, but they get the job done and for the prices here that is at the bottom of the totem pole of concerns.

Overall, the store is great and it is a go-to location when shopping at Haymarket."
380,10,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,10/12/2018,"this restaurant is my fav one when it comes to Algerian/Morrocan food, they serve really delicious food for cheap prices, they got special plate on friday (Couscous) which is famous traditional algerian plate.
also there is the grocery store / meat store downstairs which offer fresh Halal meats and a lot of food and stuff."

Their meats are freshly cut, and also carry organic chicken. 
My favorite stop when going through that area"
383,13,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,2/16/2015,"The restaurant owners are very nice but a little shy. You can get anything from pizza to shawarma to kabab dinner plates. A kabab dinner cost less than $10 and is still filling. The kicker is the restaurant is open until 2am most days!

The shop under the restaurant has chicken ~$2/lb and red meat ~4/lb and the meat is fresh. Lots of exotic fruit juices and the spices are good quality. 

Worth the visit!"
384,14,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,1/4/2013,"Like Don W., I am reviewing the store underneath the restaurant, which is not marked and looks rather sketchy as you descend down into the dark, but it is brimming with all kinds of well priced items and a couple of misplaced pigeons. 

Garden Halal is not just a meat store. (I do not eat any meat at all and got lots of items here.) The butcher, the baker, the fishmonger and the olive grower all contribute to the huge assortment of products. You can scoop up a varied selection of olives, find well priced, authentic Nutella (the one in the glass jar- much better) and pick up some lentils, huge jars of spices, cookies, pastries or even some cooked shrimp. (Their fresh fish looks fine, but I have not purchased any yet, out of loyalty to New Deal.) If you like good prices, independently owned specialty markets and lots of choices, you need to make this a destination next time you are in the vicinity of Haymarket or Government Center. 

Based on the number of people down here on my first visit, this place is a hidden jewel with much to explore. It's right near Harry's Cheese Shop (also a treasure) and there are two entrances, but they are not well marked. Descend you must. Just don't trip over the pigeons who mix, mingle and coo around the boots and shoes of us busy shoppers."
385,15,Garden Halal Meat,3 star rating,4/16/2017,"This is a difficult rating for me to give them. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma wrap ($6.99) to go. Then I sat there waiting for about 10 minutes, wondering what was going on. I could see the guy behind the counter, but he didn't look like he was doing anything about my order. After a while, I realized he must've been cooking the chicken in the back. After a while I saw him pick up a wrap (not a pita wrap though; some sort of weird hybrid between a tortilla and pita), and then start asking me which toppings I wanted (lettuce, tomatoes, olives, onions). And then he asked me if I wanted mayo or ranch. Stop. I'm sorry, did you say MAYO and RANCH?! Do you think I'm some kind of uncultured buffoon? Hell no, I'm not putting that in my wrap. So I told him no, and started feeling a little off-put. He started wrapping up my order, and I realized I never saw him add tzatziki sauce (which was on the description of my order, and lets be real, basically makes or breaks any Greek-style order). Which I asked him. And he replied, ""we don't have any"". We don't have any as in we are out, or as in it has never set foot in our store?? Then he asked me again if I wanted mayo or ranch. Still said no to that one. So I left the place feeling slighted. I feel like that's something he should've said at the beginning. It's quite simple: ""we don't have any tzatziki sauce, is that okay?"" Because honestly, I would've gone someplace else! I don't want a dry Chicken chicken Shawarma! Which it was. Don't mistake me, the meat was very good; well-seasoned and tender, but it didn't taste very authentic (not that ranch or mayo would've fixed that ), and every bite I took made me feel like I'd lost an opportunity to eat a delicious meal. It ruined the experience for me. In that regards, I rate the quality and taste of the food (4/5). I've had better, but it was good. And customer service gets a (2/5). That just really hit me hard. Particularly since I'm in town visiting, it's not as if I can just go back next week and get it again, with tzatziki (not that they're guaranteed to have any, since apparently ""we don't have any"" is the new ambiguous response""). And I feel like my 7 bucks fell short. Anyways, moral of the novella: ASK IF THEY HAVE TZATZIKI BEFORE YOU ORDER."
386,16,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,8/6/2015,"great hole in the wall restaurant. Food is delicious, filling and affordable. They have a $10 credit card minimum so remember to bring cash. Service is friendly. Don't come expecting constant check ups but they do take care. Will definitely come back."
387,17,Garden Halal Meat,5 star rating,5/8/2010,"Garden Halal has a secret.  Underneath the restaurant is the store and this is a review of the store.  There's no sign that I could see, but the packages of food all say Garden Halal Market.  There are tons of Middle Eastern goodies, a Halal butcher, and my favorite: a fish counter with some really good prices!  We just picked up some gorgeous tuna steaks for $4.99/lb.  Come here on a Saturday, buy everything but the vegetables here and then go outside and finish your shopping.  You'll pay about half as much as you'd pay in the supermarket.

And if you're a tourist staying somewhere near Faneuil Hall, this is a good place to pick up some snacks and it's the side of Boston that doesn't have the ""Lobstah"" and ""Hahvahd"" t-shirts."
388,18,Garden Halal Meat,3 star rating,8/5/2009,"We discovered Garden Halal as if it dropped from the sky. As North End residents, we often tire of Italian cuisine. Sometimes we just want a good sandwich or shawarma. It was about 9 pm and all the shawarma restaurants we could think of were probably already closed or not within walking distance. We just about gave up and went to Hot Tomatoes when we spotted Garden Halal's neon sign in the distance. Lo and behold, a shawarma restaurant!

Garden Halal is basically a take out place/deli. Its menu has sections for Somali cuisine, Italian-style subs & pizza (slices are pretty cheap - $1.25 to $1.75 including Halal pepperoni), and shawarma. The deli had various salads, two chicken dishes, rice, some curry-type dishes. 

We each had beef shawarma sandwiches. It took a long time for them to make it--each beef strip is freshly grilled. (Unlike Boston Shawarma on Huntington, where the beef is already cooked). In addition to generous strips of beef, the sandwiches have fresh cilantro, tomato, garlic, and onion. There was very little dressing/sauce--pretty dry.  Each was $6 (tax incl.)

We also ordered a side of carrots. The carrots were cooked soft, chilled and marinated with cilantro, mint, olive oil, and vinegar. The side was $3.25 (tax incl.)

All in all, it was pretty good, and a nice alternative to eating Italian."
389,19,Garden Halal Meat,4 star rating,8/4/2012,"I was so happy when I found this place on a trip to Boston. It can be tough to find halal restaurants when traveling, but Garden Halal came to my rescue! If you go, I suggest walking over to the park and having a picnic like I did (if weather permits)  The food was reasonable and yummy, I will come back if I find myself in Boston again. : )"
